028314|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_168.wav|||As long as it is possible, we will keep going.|
035568|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_113.wav|||It has been hijacked.|
036215|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_336.wav|||Will he be given time?|
028217|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_071.wav|||That's just the way the game is evolving.|
038099|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_114.wav|||We're not that bad.|
031747|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_065.wav|||Only one got through.|
035664|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_209.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
041401|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_105.wav|||It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|
034271|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_063.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
038244|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_259.wav|||The memory is there.|
035983|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_104.wav|||It was more like a Labour Party rally.|
027554|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_212.wav|||It is all one-sided.|
036082|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_203.wav|||Our message was inclusive.|

041480|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_185.wav|||We want to be part of it.|
031567|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_309.wav|||It is just like the stock market.|
025962|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_283.wav|||This is our unfinished business.|
031459|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_201.wav|||That was the personal impulse.|

027387|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_045.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
031914|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_232.wav|||We have to defend ourselves.|
042128|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_410.wav|||Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|
031985|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_303.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|

041989|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_271.wav|||This is not a crisis.|
026811|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_298.wav|||After that, we made some changes.|
039746|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_117.wav|||It is really good news.|

041598|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
028237|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_091.wav|||People love to see this stuff.|
035585|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_130.wav|||It was an ambush.|

027798|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_051.wav|||On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.|
034313|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_105.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
041028|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_156.wav|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|

041086|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_214.wav|||It was one of those things.|
041238|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_366.wav|||It will set the tone.|
039217|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_386.wav|||That gave us some confidence.|

035644|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_189.wav|||I think it's awful.|
035832|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_377.wav|||The written judgment was issued in printed form.|
040976|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_104.wav|||The call was ignored.|
030189|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_125.wav|||Wallace was a prisoner of war.|
028275|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_129.wav|||We now have to concentrate on the league.|
040873|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
028316|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_170.wav|||The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.|
036619|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_320.wav|||We will just get on with it.|
038888|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_056.wav|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|
027425|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_083.wav|||He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|
036422|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_121.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
036935|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_213.wav|||The house was full of smoke.|
041354|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_058.wav|||This resulted in the following.|
035879|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_424.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
027635|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_293.wav|||It was not a difficult decision, he said.|
027655|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_313.wav|||He was released in March this year.|
031403|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_144.wav|||If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|
038884|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_052.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
036424|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_123.wav|||Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.|
029779|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_136.wav|||Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.|
032036|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_354.wav|||So it goes on.|
031976|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
038068|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_082.wav|||I won't let that happen.|
031776|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_094.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
025830|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_150.wav|||It's a great idea.|
031452|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_194.wav|||I just had so much fun.|
026612|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_096.wav|||However, their reaction could not have been more different.|
041173|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_301.wav|||He will be missed.|
041037|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_165.wav|||We're very unhappy about it.|
036183|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_304.wav|||It became a national network.|
034338|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_130.wav|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
038015|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_029.wav|||What is a house without it?|
041425|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_129.wav|||How do you take them away?|
026604|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_087.wav|||That's how she wants to remember him.|
030152|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_087.wav|||We do need a new one.|
039773|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_144.wav|||In fact, they will not be disciplined.|
034601|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_393.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
036609|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_309.wav|||Was that not awful?|
042060|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_342.wav|||They are in good spirits.|
038144|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_159.wav|||The enemy was time.|
036568|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_268.wav|||It had been in place since last July.|
029790|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_147.wav|||They were even being used by primary pupils.|
030169|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_104.wav|||After all, he is the King of Scotland.|
029735|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_092.wav|||He had done his homework properly.|
036961|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_239.wav|||This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.|
036135|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_256.wav|||It could have been a hammering by now.|
028556|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_410.wav|||Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|
029924|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_281.wav|||They really did a great job.|
026560|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_041.wav|||Fewer people are being killed in accidents.|
028059|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_312.wav|||The Allies intend to maintain the average.|
026011|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_332.wav|||The need for further investment is obvious.|
035651|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_196.wav|||Nor should there have been.|
034310|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_102.wav|||There was no trouble at all.|
039002|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_170.wav|||We must not give in to bastards.|
028332|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_186.wav|||The early evidence suggests he did not.|
036926|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_204.wav|||I'm trying to stay open on that.|
042119|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_401.wav|||My mother was getting on at me.|
036159|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_280.wav|||Who would take it now, after all this?|
027942|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_195.wav|||I would like Glasgow.|
031004|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_168.wav|||After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|
032044|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_362.wav|||I hope he would have been very pleased.|
036543|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_243.wav|||This is the subway.|
035632|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_177.wav|||That is the first job of the director - leadership.|
030099|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_034.wav|||Blood samples have been taken.|
038898|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_066.wav|||He is pretty upset.|
031924|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_242.wav|||It was just above the roof.|
038890|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_058.wav|||Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.|
038048|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_062.wav|||Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.|
030969|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_133.wav|||I was just overwhelmed.|
039227|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_396.wav|||But it is all by design.|
026930|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_417.wav|||This is his personal life.|
032078|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_396.wav|||She is fulfilled by it.|
032052|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_370.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
025866|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_186.wav|||The fire was falling from the sky.|
027681|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_339.wav|||Barry will be able to handle this.|
031225|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_389.wav|||The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.|
041023|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_151.wav|||This has been carried out.|
028408|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_262.wav|||Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|
038092|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_107.wav|||It was a bit of a tightrope.|
032032|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_350.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
035623|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_168.wav|||I am not a magician.|
038074|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_088.wav|||We spoke about a few people.|
039854|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_225.wav|||I can't get away from it.|
031002|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_166.wav|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
039830|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_201.wav|||It was too close to call.|
027639|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_297.wav|||It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.|
036264|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_385.wav|||It was a very difficult decision for us.|
035930|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_051.wav|||This was the classical period of Beethoven.|
035803|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_348.wav|||First is open defiance.|
035929|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_050.wav|||There will be widespread support on all sides.|
039221|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_390.wav|||Then came the second round.|
041646|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_351.wav|||From the opening Could It Be Magic?|
036700|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_401.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
036857|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_134.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
031147|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_311.wav|||It plans to return to this field.|
028261|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_115.wav|||They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.|
026682|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_166.wav|||He died from multiple injuries.|
041961|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_243.wav|||It doesn't make them evil.|
026603|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_086.wav|||She is still very poorly.|
039021|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_189.wav|||I've already done that.|
038153|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_168.wav|||I would like to make an impact, of course.|
031966|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_284.wav|||Even then this game was not over.|
041415|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_119.wav|||Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|
030850|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
026920|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_407.wav|||One policeman was killed.|
038283|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_298.wav|||I have no worry about that.|
031585|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_327.wav|||The goal will stay with me forever.|
026788|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_275.wav|||How do you find the youngsters?|
030979|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_143.wav|||Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|
029811|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_168.wav|||In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.|
031364|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_105.wav|||His treatment has been quite atrocious.|
030196|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_132.wav|||I've always been desperate to play this part.|
041334|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_038.wav|||And this was well known?|
041604|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_309.wav|||Does it make a profit?|
028184|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_038.wav|||That respect is missing in the Netherlands.|
041822|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_103.wav|||The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.|
028173|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_027.wav|||You need a long-term strategy in football.|
037063|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_341.wav|||Looking at him is proof of the pudding.|
029976|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_333.wav|||One must hope not!|
036066|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_187.wav|||He went to see what he could learn.|
039931|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_303.wav|||Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|
038267|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_282.wav|||No other family members could be contacted.|
034220|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039997|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_369.wav|||He will take it in his stride.|
036555|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_255.wav|||But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|
031638|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_380.wav|||I joined a group.|
034609|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_401.wav|||I found that much more challenging.|
029838|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_195.wav|||It just came into my head that day.|
036606|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_306.wav|||They certainly do not socialise.|
041681|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_386.wav|||It could have been prevented.|
041484|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_189.wav|||Now he is back on top again.|
036402|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_101.wav|||Happily we found it in the library.|
030151|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_086.wav|||I have made good progress.|
026906|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_393.wav|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
036623|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_324.wav|||I haven't won the world title.|
028466|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_320.wav|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
029999|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_356.wav|||The whole team was rubbish.|
027452|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_110.wav|||That, he claimed, was essential.|
030034|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_391.wav|||This is entirely appropriate and overdue.|
031986|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_304.wav|||We have worked well with them for years.|
026772|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_259.wav|||They were assured that it would.|
026935|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_422.wav|||It's a true story.|
032040|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_358.wav|||I am greatly encouraged.|
030154|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_089.wav|||We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.|
028250|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_104.wav|||I needed a change, a new challenge.|
034411|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_203.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
035976|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_097.wav|||Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.|
028039|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_292.wav|||Everyone knew where they were.|
027775|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_028.wav|||The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.|

041113|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_241.wav|||It is all very upbeat.|
034450|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_242.wav|||I tried to push him away.|
030053|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_410.wav|||He has never even been to Ireland.|
029921|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_278.wav|||Yet he chose to do something different.|
027470|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_128.wav|||I was pleased with my own game.|
027346|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
030381|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_323.wav|||I didn't know what he was capable of.|
031301|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_042.wav|||There are big names.|
039185|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_354.wav|||The workers said they were treated like animals.|

038336|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_351.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|

041808|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_089.wav|||There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|
026771|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_258.wav|||The farmers had no choice in the matter.|
026674|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_158.wav|||The man was pronounced dead on arrival.|
030910|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_074.wav|||We actually haven't managed to meet demand.|
036454|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_153.wav|||I will certainly be having words with him.|

029980|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_337.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|

026570|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_051.wav|||I would like to stay with Rangers.|
029866|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_223.wav|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
035761|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_306.wav|||But we'll just keep trying to get results.|
028409|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_263.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
038131|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_146.wav|||But it does not matter.|
039234|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_403.wav|||She will just have wanted her baby.|
040949|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_077.wav|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
038959|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_127.wav|||I'm so proud of my team.|
041525|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_230.wav|||Eight others are also believed to have died.|
027400|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_058.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
041798|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_079.wav|||I don't know what it means.|
041398|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_102.wav|||I welcome the decision.|
031163|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_327.wav|||Crucially, though, United were still alive.|
042072|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_354.wav|||We are delighted with the result.|
028415|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_269.wav|||I am not happy with proposals for widows.|
027569|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_227.wav|||They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|
031841|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_159.wav|||The party will make up its own mind.|
026004|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_325.wav|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
029796|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_153.wav|||He will do so today in Monte Carlo.|
029738|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_095.wav|||We will have to see, but it makes you think.|
036218|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_339.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
031948|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_266.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
027571|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_229.wav|||I think he has undergone a sea change.|
027482|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_140.wav|||A world away from Rangers, you might say.|
027699|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_357.wav|||Nobody ever gets to see them.|
040881|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041549|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_254.wav|||It came in bits and pieces.|
034424|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_216.wav|||We are still paying the price for that.|
039005|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_173.wav|||My house was shaking at the time.|
028180|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_034.wav|||I kept my side of the bargain.|
029958|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_315.wav|||I think the Government should pay for that.|
038049|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_063.wav|||I am not retaining him.|
037007|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_285.wav|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
040937|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_065.wav|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
031881|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_199.wav|||She was not hard done by.|
037050|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_328.wav|||He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.|
038933|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_101.wav|||That meant the search was unlawful.|
037116|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_394.wav|||He sat down at the piano.|
039195|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_364.wav|||What's happening to her?|
041503|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_208.wav|||The pace is telling.|
036462|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_161.wav|||It was a breathtaking moment.|
027606|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_264.wav|||So there's a double whammy.|
041630|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_335.wav|||It is our other home.|
031085|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_249.wav|||It means they actually control the programme.|
038076|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_090.wav|||In fact, he took it very well.|
027381|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_039.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
026784|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_271.wav|||Who reminded him about the score?|
039910|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_282.wav|||We are not going to be complacent.|
025950|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_271.wav|||I also thought, This is a feature film.|
040961|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_089.wav|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
037034|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_312.wav|||The public have been very supportive.|
032023|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_341.wav|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
031306|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_047.wav|||I hope you will leave it at that.|
041396|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_100.wav|||What has changed since then?|
030927|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_091.wav|||He was a crazy man.|
038955|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_123.wav|||The lady is right.|
027830|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_083.wav|||They are not an item.|
031256|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_420.wav|||This would discourage investment and job creation.|
036919|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_197.wav|||Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|
027819|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_072.wav|||In the past few years, they have started to fight back.|
039709|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_080.wav|||We should be capable of managing it, though.|
035641|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_186.wav|||I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|
039791|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_162.wav|||I suggest a new plan.|
036133|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_254.wav|||That is a break with tradition.|
029942|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_299.wav|||That's how it worked in Bosnia.|
027512|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_170.wav|||She is a very lucky lady.|
031494|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_236.wav|||I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|
029793|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_150.wav|||In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|
038963|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_131.wav|||You can see their point.|
026013|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_334.wav|||It's hard, but we have had so much to do.|
035995|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_116.wav|||So, how will it be received in the US?|
036712|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_413.wav|||Is this accurate?|
038059|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_073.wav|||Several others were absent.|
036244|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_365.wav|||The rear of the plane was on fire.|
041515|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_220.wav|||It is an outrage.|
041758|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_039.wav|||To beat the European champion is quite nice.|
038295|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_310.wav|||We have nothing to lose.|
039943|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_315.wav|||Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|
031270|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026931|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_418.wav|||Now he is trying to downgrade the media.|
036175|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_296.wav|||For now, we must take one game at a time.|
027523|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_181.wav|||You see - this business is a good one.|
041030|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_158.wav|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
035727|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_272.wav|||Today's ruling confirms that fact.|
036413|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_112.wav|||It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.|
034388|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
040968|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_096.wav|||Buildings are about people.|
041701|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_406.wav|||It is truly masterly performance.|
036509|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_208.wav|||He is only now regaining his confidence.|
031525|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_267.wav|||It's such a trial!|
036517|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_217.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
038088|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_102.wav|||To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.|
036340|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_039.wav|||His views are hardly surprising.|
036971|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_249.wav|||That's why they go to the opera.|
026668|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_152.wav|||I will go out with him any time.|
039054|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_222.wav|||It is all one-sided.|
041727|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
029947|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_304.wav|||His signature is his handwriting.|
028183|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_037.wav|||He released a half-dozen solo albums.|
039112|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_281.wav|||The manager knew me very well.|
039104|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_273.wav|||Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|
041448|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_153.wav|||It has still to be recovered.|
030412|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_356.wav|||No person was charged.|
036530|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_230.wav|||She will also get a pay rise.|
028192|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_046.wav|||She added, It is the same story in both countries.|
029773|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_130.wav|||McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.|

031112|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_276.wav|||We've turned the corner.|
041295|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_423.wav|||It's unfair on her.|
026757|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_242.wav|||Dialogue is the key.|
041983|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_265.wav|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
027813|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_066.wav|||He also does not get along with Christina.|
034541|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_333.wav|||But when we do it is great.|
039939|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_311.wav|||I wouldn't have had the abandon.|
031373|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_114.wav|||Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|
032062|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_380.wav|||And it covers the spectrum.|
029820|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_177.wav|||This is a dream come true for me.|
036544|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_244.wav|||Altman has every right to be bitter.|
041566|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_271.wav|||It's not the tour.|
038223|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_238.wav|||We act because we must.|
031616|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_358.wav|||This is the lowest of the low.|
036132|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_253.wav|||It was to be published next month.|
031418|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_159.wav|||It's never the same problem.|

041132|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_260.wav|||We couldn't believe it at first.|
027966|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_219.wav|||I might get an injury very easily.|
039859|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_230.wav|||They are very frightened.|
034622|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
039008|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_176.wav|||This is a very positive step forward.|
031462|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_204.wav|||What is the truth about the cow?|
038371|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_386.wav|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038041|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_055.wav|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|

028069|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_322.wav|||Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|
027407|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_065.wav|||He takes time out for everyone.|
030972|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_136.wav|||Do you think they would do any better?|
036557|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_257.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
035749|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_294.wav|||The referee had been right.|
039058|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_226.wav|||That's the day job.|

026697|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_181.wav|||I wish him well.|
036907|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_185.wav|||And what was that like, as an experience?|
035628|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_173.wav|||They had previously been on five-day notice.|
041324|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_028.wav|||These decisions are not simple.|
035551|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_096.wav|||Jamming would be equally difficult.|
028296|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_150.wav|||But it looks good for next year.|
035486|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_031.wav|||I had found my vision.|
027790|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_043.wav|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|

030350|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_292.wav|||Everyone knew where they were.|
036359|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_058.wav|||The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.|

040959|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_087.wav|||It seems very odd.|
042046|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_328.wav|||It will be a new experience.|
029746|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_103.wav|||It is understood they saw one body.|

041248|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_376.wav|||But everywhere the problems are the same.|
031031|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_195.wav|||Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|
030015|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_372.wav|||There is nothing like a fresh start.|
036059|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_180.wav|||He urged Mr Blair to get out more.|
026799|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_286.wav|||The whole matter is somewhat in the air.|
028536|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_390.wav|||Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.|
038947|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_115.wav|||The breakdown was much later in her life.|
036450|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_149.wav|||We actually haven't managed to meet demand.|

031322|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_063.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
041766|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_047.wav|||I am so upset.|
039792|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_163.wav|||IT takes the biscuit.|
038270|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_285.wav|||But do not rely on it.|
041647|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_352.wav|||The duties are still to be drawn up.|
031990|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_308.wav|||The director's a genius.|
034467|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
032012|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_330.wav|||If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|
027692|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_350.wav|||The workers said they were treated like animals.|
031692|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040909|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_037.wav|||We are just happy that hasn't happened.|
031693|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
038004|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026610|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_094.wav|||Broomfield was the centre of the town.|
027528|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_186.wav|||It also highlighted some local hero districts.|
031853|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_171.wav|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
036795|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_072.wav|||We are looking for volunteers.|
038864|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_032.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
041213|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_341.wav|||There will be no backing down.|
030387|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_329.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
036141|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_262.wav|||I played really well on the back nine.|
041187|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_315.wav|||We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|
036127|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_248.wav|||The principle is quite clear.|
031582|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_324.wav|||However, in October another partnership was announced.|
026066|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_387.wav|||He is in the queue.|
025784|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_104.wav|||I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|
025906|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_226.wav|||Advice and counselling will be offered.|
035750|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_295.wav|||Our young people are leaving.|
028021|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_274.wav|||It does not move, which is amazing.|
035759|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_304.wav|||She had kept the news from him.|
025739|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_059.wav|||We are only human.|
035788|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_333.wav|||Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.|
035829|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_374.wav|||But we could not change his mind.|
031243|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_407.wav|||No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|
031778|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_096.wav|||Surely history will not repeat itself.|
034509|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_301.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
027410|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_068.wav|||A number of people could not speak English.|
036519|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_219.wav|||If only we had known.|
041440|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_145.wav|||She has never mentioned it.|
035769|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_314.wav|||However, in October another partnership was announced.|
042073|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_355.wav|||It will take time.|
036224|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_345.wav|||Hopefully we can use this as a platform.|
030344|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_286.wav|||The law will take its course.|
031667|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_409.wav|||We had a reunion last week.|
040975|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_103.wav|||It is harder than you think.|
025752|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_072.wav|||I found the course inspiring.|
035669|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_214.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
027982|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_235.wav|||Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.|
028352|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_206.wav|||It opens the door to the Champions League.|
036418|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_117.wav|||That left a bad taste in my mouth.|
035475|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039727|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_098.wav|||However, his involvement was instant.|
036434|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_133.wav|||A young Briton had a lucky escape.|
031358|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_099.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|

035837|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_382.wav|||He was dead on arrival at the hospital.|
031309|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_050.wav|||Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
029805|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_162.wav|||For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.|
031493|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_235.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|

036351|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_050.wav|||Everything was an effort.|
039052|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_220.wav|||I just could not cope.|
025980|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_301.wav|||Their bid was a very good one.|
027925|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_178.wav|||It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.|
041729|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041625|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_330.wav|||In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|
039680|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_051.wav|||It was time to act.|
034607|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_399.wav|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
028323|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_177.wav|||But is it ethical to practice in humans?|
041137|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_265.wav|||There is no answer to it.|
036575|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_275.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
035964|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_085.wav|||I did not want any damage to us.|
041445|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_150.wav|||And it was great for me.|
038392|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_407.wav|||It is an investment in our product.|
026703|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_187.wav|||I'll tell you honestly.|
030229|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_166.wav|||Running costs are not subsidised by public money.|

038363|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_378.wav|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
028456|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_310.wav|||Of further privacy, he had no need.|
038215|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_230.wav|||It has to be put in context.|
036048|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_169.wav|||This is not a Scottish problem.|
030413|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_357.wav|||I've only met him three times.|
041039|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_167.wav|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
039840|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_211.wav|||Drugs are getting through.|
038014|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_028.wav|||It's a big mystery.|
041235|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_363.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
035597|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_142.wav|||And he had much need.|
031129|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_293.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
025721|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_041.wav|||I've been dying for an hour.|
028346|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_200.wav|||They tend to be easily influenced by others.|
039210|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_379.wav|||I didn't do too badly myself.|
036491|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_190.wav|||The weekly average was three hours.|
027437|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_095.wav|||Our offer will remain on the table.|
031830|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_148.wav|||This is in a league of its own.|
028455|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_309.wav|||This fact is supported by audience research.|
028001|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_254.wav|||People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.|
036375|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_074.wav|||That would have killed the match.|
041508|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_213.wav|||The response was really good.|
028118|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_372.wav|||If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|
027478|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_136.wav|||The road was closed for several hours.|
026728|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_212.wav|||THE atmosphere was electric.|
035825|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_370.wav|||Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|
036182|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_303.wav|||It is quite an eye opener.|
031311|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_052.wav|||I fell to the ground.|
036781|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_058.wav|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
034272|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_064.wav|||I learned a lot from that.|
038315|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_330.wav|||We have expected it.|
042086|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_368.wav|||You can't really compare.|
041607|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_312.wav|||I knew him well.|
041253|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_381.wav|||Other musicians were found in retirement.|
036872|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_149.wav|||He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.|
030023|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_380.wav|||He was released in March this year.|
041080|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_208.wav|||That remains the unanswered question.|
029682|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_039.wav|||He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|
036757|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_034.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|
034521|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_313.wav|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
039892|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_263.wav|||I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|
027662|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_320.wav|||I think in three dimensions.|
030973|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_137.wav|||We are very concerned about controller fatigue.|
041513|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_218.wav|||But we were wrong.|
041467|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_172.wav|||It is a very demanding course.|
040907|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_035.wav|||He would not have to explain.|
029739|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_096.wav|||We must keep our feet on the ground.|
039671|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_042.wav|||You can see how he made his money.|
027616|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_274.wav|||We have got a full house tonight.|
029789|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_146.wav|||My future is in the marathon.|
041093|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_221.wav|||That has not changed.|
036789|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_066.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
025710|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_030.wav|||He said she was mad.|
030054|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_411.wav|||We believe the squad will stay together.|
038242|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_257.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
036049|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_170.wav|||It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.|
035747|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_292.wav|||The methadone programme is completely out of control.|
032031|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_349.wav|||I think we have got the balance right.|
027799|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_052.wav|||It's a grey area.|
038944|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_112.wav|||I love this tournament.|
036853|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_130.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
029953|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_310.wav|||NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.|
041559|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_264.wav|||There is no other offer on the table.|
028374|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_228.wav|||More money for students would help - in an ideal world.|
035809|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_354.wav|||Their mind was already made up.|
042021|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_303.wav|||We have nothing to hide.|
038924|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_092.wav|||Israel has done very little until now.|
028218|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_072.wav|||Michael is putting on a brave face.|
035802|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_347.wav|||Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|
038125|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_140.wav|||My ambition is to make the cut.|
025791|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_111.wav|||We have great confidence in Derek.|
025965|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_286.wav|||It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|
026875|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_362.wav|||He had lost his confidence again.|
028542|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_396.wav|||It was early morning.|
036819|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_096.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
038367|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_382.wav|||Our position is quite clear.|
035661|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_206.wav|||We will not break even.|
028026|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_279.wav|||But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.|
039171|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_340.wav|||Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|
027564|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_222.wav|||Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.|
035564|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_109.wav|||He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|
039701|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_072.wav|||Among them is his beloved teacher.|
028159|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
031040|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_204.wav|||Have we not had the rainy season already?|
039025|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_193.wav|||It has to be a long-term commitment.|
031461|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_203.wav|||But first it goes out on TV.|
031635|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_377.wav|||Such actions are rarely popular.|
036672|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_373.wav|||This is important for two reasons.|
029665|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
031611|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_353.wav|||That is of no use.|
027822|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_075.wav|||She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.|
042121|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_403.wav|||It's going to be great!|
041387|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_091.wav|||Where are they?|
040932|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_060.wav|||But there is no easy option.|
041761|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_042.wav|||The chances were plentiful.|
041687|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_392.wav|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
035931|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_052.wav|||He has one son and one daughter.|
041810|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_091.wav|||It's not my fault.|
039786|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_157.wav|||No, you couldn't make it up.|
036641|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_342.wav|||So, how will it be received in the US?|
030316|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_256.wav|||Our objective is to tackle poverty.|
027858|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_111.wav|||I'm not a diva.|
035822|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_367.wav|||So what does one do?|
036632|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_333.wav|||They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|
031886|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_204.wav|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
041163|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_291.wav|||We've been here before.|
030299|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_239.wav|||It's just gotten too big.|
034498|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_290.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
036835|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_112.wav|||It didn't take long.|
036553|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_253.wav|||We are still getting signals.|
041468|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_173.wav|||Can he do it?|
035528|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_073.wav|||He would be with his peers.|
027722|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_380.wav|||Do what you have to do.|
041214|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_342.wav|||The atmosphere was excellent.|
031122|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_286.wav|||The new system will be marketed this summer.|
025865|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_185.wav|||It's a huge amount.|
041188|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_316.wav|||I don't mean in a frightening way.|
035472|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041041|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_169.wav|||It is about the script for me.|
035794|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_339.wav|||I'll take the blame for that.|
027623|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_281.wav|||The whole team was rubbish.|
034275|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_067.wav|||Sandy was very active.|
041933|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_215.wav|||We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|
038271|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_286.wav|||I made a mistake.|
036252|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_373.wav|||He scored a touchdown.|
026912|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_399.wav|||The work with Alison was a great experience.|
031006|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_170.wav|||But she's also beautiful behind the face.|
036109|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_230.wav|||We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|
031424|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_165.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031668|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_410.wav|||This will help our confidence.|
027401|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_059.wav|||He added, It's not a racial problem.|
026695|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_179.wav|||The first time you read a play.|
030356|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_298.wav|||My view has now completely changed.|
031580|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_322.wav|||But we were wrong.|
031458|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_200.wav|||They responded with victories.|
027945|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_198.wav|||Both of them have looked good.|
025937|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_258.wav|||They are in care for a reason.|
038124|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_139.wav|||How can they tell?|
029781|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_138.wav|||Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.|
039771|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_142.wav|||Scotland has lost a great man.|
031879|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_197.wav|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
028514|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_368.wav|||If they have City backing, what is the influence?|
038012|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_026.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|
038069|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_083.wav|||Or have they?|
028308|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_162.wav|||I understand the medical concerns.|
038281|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_296.wav|||I have nothing to say on that.|
027372|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_030.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
025956|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_277.wav|||From there, it was a success story.|
031298|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_039.wav|||But one shouldn't go by that.|
027579|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_237.wav|||I hate the word.|
031959|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_277.wav|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
031489|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_231.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
030390|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_332.wav|||He made no big mistakes.|
036267|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_388.wav|||That would open the gates of hell.|
042036|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_318.wav|||It is good news for us.|
039763|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_134.wav|||The shooting created panic in the street.|
041909|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_190.wav|||We will win this tie.|
028048|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_301.wav|||He was then replaced by Ross.|
034565|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_357.wav|||It seems very odd.|
027916|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_169.wav|||Who do these people think they are?|
036884|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_162.wav|||But he was a full, working member of our staff.|
041931|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_213.wav|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
030899|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_063.wav|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
030149|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_084.wav|||Why did they let him go?|
028398|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_252.wav|||For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|
027394|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_052.wav|||That was the problem.|
041418|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_122.wav|||It was on my mind a little bit.|
039237|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_406.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
039764|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_135.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
038228|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_243.wav|||I could have been killed on that day.|
036111|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_232.wav|||What happened to me last week was wrong.|
027628|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_286.wav|||They must act now to tighten the rules.|
036490|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_189.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
028499|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_353.wav|||Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|
039229|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_398.wav|||We've still got a say in this.|
030181|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_117.wav|||Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|
037120|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_398.wav|||I'm sure they love it.|
036062|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_183.wav|||Euro The single currency is a fact.|
029744|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_101.wav|||The party lasted all night.|
025789|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_109.wav|||That was the context of his remarks.|
035957|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_078.wav|||The way ahead is not easy.|
031846|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_164.wav|||He changed my life.|
028548|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_402.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
031916|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_234.wav|||Where do we go from here?|
041469|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_174.wav|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
037111|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_389.wav|||Would you take them?|
040982|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_110.wav|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
036768|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_045.wav|||And we're not there yet.|
032043|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_361.wav|||The actors are confident and polished.|
028193|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_047.wav|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
027763|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
030941|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_105.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
032065|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_383.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
027771|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041127|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_255.wav|||Who would have thought it?|

028276|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_130.wav|||We need to move forward together.|
039998|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_370.wav|||I don't believe a word of it.|
041906|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_187.wav|||It was a deeply moving musical experience.|
030182|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_118.wav|||Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.|
030291|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_230.wav|||This is all part of being opening the door.|
035993|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_114.wav|||Some were close to tears.|
028446|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_300.wav|||Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|
028550|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_404.wav|||He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.|
041297|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
031922|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_240.wav|||It's not that clear-cut.|
042003|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_285.wav|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
031066|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_230.wav|||Survival is our aim.|
036150|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_271.wav|||For this government, reform and resources go together.|
030922|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_086.wav|||She could easily have been killed.|
025919|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_239.wav|||Do it for us now.|
036752|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_029.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
026654|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_138.wav|||It was better than a soap opera.|
031507|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_249.wav|||Staff should be paid for what they produce.|
034351|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_143.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
027996|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_249.wav|||He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|
026898|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_385.wav|||One might think that is a power.|
037086|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_364.wav|||It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|
025798|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_118.wav|||We are the weakest link.|
037999|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
031486|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_228.wav|||Things are moving together.|
031297|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_038.wav|||We're still talking with a few people.|
028167|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031950|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_268.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
028436|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_290.wav|||Everything has been destroyed.|
031520|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_262.wav|||That's the day job.|
031449|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_191.wav|||This is the first job of the director - leadership.|
036929|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_207.wav|||The frustration was showing.|
035694|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_239.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
035540|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_085.wav|||There are no excuses.|
036113|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_234.wav|||To a level which we consider appropriate.|
026840|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_327.wav|||You will never replace the child.|
027908|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_161.wav|||You should be there with six different characters.|
025773|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_093.wav|||But now it's back to golf.|
030156|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_091.wav|||He then had a swipe at Hearts.|
041642|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_347.wav|||This is still happening in the US.|
034618|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_410.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
040963|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_091.wav|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
041994|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_276.wav|||That's a very serious matter.|
030230|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_167.wav|||Where are his symphonies and major concertos?|
031627|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_369.wav|||I just couldn't believe what had happened.|
039706|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_077.wav|||Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.|
030240|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_178.wav|||It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.|
041250|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_378.wav|||The problems began a long time ago.|
041117|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_245.wav|||We deserved the draw.|
041162|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_290.wav|||That is the key.|
028344|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_198.wav|||Her condition last night was described as critical.|
030178|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_113.wav|||Look at them after three days of rain.|
026850|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_337.wav|||You are going to take away my life.|
041805|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_086.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
035527|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_072.wav|||Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|
031816|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_134.wav|||I could do a better job.|
028482|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_336.wav|||Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.|
030077|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
036582|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_282.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
028492|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_346.wav|||At this level, you have all to perform well.|
031196|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_360.wav|||We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|
035700|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_245.wav|||We went on to become very successful.|
031642|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_384.wav|||And they all had these other commitments.|
034630|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
039223|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_392.wav|||There was someone on the floor.|
038932|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_100.wav|||I don't think it could be clearer.|
027633|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_291.wav|||There is a cup final at stake.|
029971|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_328.wav|||It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.|
025695|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
039776|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_147.wav|||It plainly does not work.|
027889|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_142.wav|||This might seem like an outrageous assertion.|
039140|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_309.wav|||They were the better side on the day.|
038861|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_029.wav|||The injuries are not too serious.|
036134|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_255.wav|||Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.|
038362|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_377.wav|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
040918|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_046.wav|||And maybe they have.|
031153|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_317.wav|||Let us hope so.|
036145|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_266.wav|||Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.|
025935|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_256.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
034324|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
035554|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_099.wav|||This kind of problem arises everywhere.|
027930|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_183.wav|||This one was my best chance.|
031774|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_092.wav|||I am relishing the challenge.|
042048|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_330.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
031215|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_379.wav|||I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|
040953|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_081.wav|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
030349|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_291.wav|||It's not even finished.|
041804|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_085.wav|||It is not a road of life.|
031070|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_234.wav|||I'm pleased with the horse.|
028545|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_399.wav|||This is usually done by the space shuttle.|
037142|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_420.wav|||No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|
039929|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_301.wav|||It will be extremely difficult for him.|
035534|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_079.wav|||It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|
034398|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_190.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
041290|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_418.wav|||There's no place to hide.|
027679|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_337.wav|||I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.|
039062|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_230.wav|||That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.|
034276|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
038104|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_119.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
039954|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_326.wav|||I was waiting for that question.|
028491|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_345.wav|||Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.|
039655|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_026.wav|||I want to go home.|
036382|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_081.wav|||They wanted to show what they could do.|
036610|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_310.wav|||That was him under pressure.|
027974|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_227.wav|||It was a poor performance.|
041231|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_359.wav|||He has never let them down.|
031847|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_165.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
031128|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_292.wav|||Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|
030974|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_138.wav|||Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.|
038398|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_413.wav|||I saw it later in the news.|
031962|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_280.wav|||There are two ways to start a festival.|
030921|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_085.wav|||Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.|
035592|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_137.wav|||I felt under no pressure today.|
026859|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_346.wav|||It was blown out of proportion.|
042049|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_331.wav|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
041481|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_186.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
036044|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_165.wav|||At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.|
041371|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_075.wav|||They were looking for things.|
036405|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_104.wav|||Safety was also an issue.|
027791|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_044.wav|||We like being the underdogs.|
032104|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_422.wav|||It's something we want to make work.|
028107|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_361.wav|||Nato has completed planning for air strikes.|
025841|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_161.wav|||There is no shortage of commitment.|
035774|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_319.wav|||The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|
026868|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_355.wav|||This should include procedures for personal imports.|
038328|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_343.wav|||Only injury has prevented that happening before.|
025899|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_219.wav|||Then they killed another three.|
031396|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_137.wav|||People can describe a moment in their life.|
026791|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_278.wav|||We've always had a very positive attitude.|
039933|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_305.wav|||I didn't know she could do that.|
026620|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_104.wav|||If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.|
038204|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_219.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
025694|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
027644|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_302.wav|||They were the better side on the day.|
041241|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_369.wav|||I think he will.|
039686|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_057.wav|||He was between people and God.|
039689|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_060.wav|||No casualties were reported.|
034421|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_213.wav|||The squad will be the same for France.|
038850|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
028064|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_317.wav|||I enjoy playing with both of them.|
041318|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
029926|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_283.wav|||It was worth a photograph.|
037101|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_379.wav|||He said to me, Which one, son?|
038100|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_115.wav|||Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.|
031230|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_394.wav|||His condition was stable last night.|
025820|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_140.wav|||It was a hugely popular decision.|
041405|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_109.wav|||Talk of a crisis is absurd.|
034508|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_300.wav|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
034427|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_219.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
038314|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_329.wav|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
035982|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_103.wav|||An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.|
031175|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_339.wav|||ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.|
036300|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_421.wav|||We will do so again.|
041770|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_051.wav|||Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|
026056|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_377.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
030214|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_151.wav|||That would be poetic, wouldn't it?|
027426|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_084.wav|||But there was a shift.|
036497|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_196.wav|||Craig is still suffering seizures.|
031824|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_142.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
038922|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_090.wav|||The feedback from audiences was just so positive.|
042089|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_371.wav|||We need to increase the membership.|
041539|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_244.wav|||Sadly it is a mess.|

041119|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_247.wav|||It's up to the defence team.|
032091|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_409.wav|||I was furious about it.|

034507|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_299.wav|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
028348|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_202.wav|||There are some serious ethical issues involved.|
034280|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
031691|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041846|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_127.wav|||Well, you don't have time.|
031146|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_310.wav|||Entries for the event are still being accepted.|
030030|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_387.wav|||It broke up my marriage.|
039017|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_185.wav|||We've been there for seven years.|
031944|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_262.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
036583|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_283.wav|||It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.|
035633|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_178.wav|||It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|
036951|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_229.wav|||However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|
027705|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_363.wav|||Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.|
035484|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_029.wav|||I fell in love with ballet.|

034402|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_194.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|

027733|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_391.wav|||Everything is surrounded by confusion.|
039102|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_271.wav|||And we still have to pay his salary.|

039116|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_285.wav|||If they don't, they won't get what they want.|
026544|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_025.wav|||But it's been kept to a minimum.|
031168|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_332.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|

039004|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_172.wav|||In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|
034571|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_363.wav|||This is an internal matter.|

031513|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_255.wav|||We went on to become very successful.|
041885|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_166.wav|||So, easy does it.|
027519|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_177.wav|||His signature is his handwriting.|
028259|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_113.wav|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
037106|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_384.wav|||His death was a tragic accident.|
029685|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_042.wav|||He also admitted possessing a firearm.|
028302|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_156.wav|||But you can't have it both ways.|
041165|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_293.wav|||I have never been unemployed.|
028211|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_065.wav|||After this, the exercise was due to begin.|
026918|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_405.wav|||Last week, he was taken into hospital.|
038263|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_278.wav|||It does nothing for me.|
034515|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_307.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
030888|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_052.wav|||He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|
038091|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_105.wav|||We have been so lucky.|
035556|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_101.wav|||Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|
031248|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_412.wav|||Like anyone else, he has to take his time.|
026658|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_142.wav|||Nato was not a love affair.|
027883|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_136.wav|||All our thoughts and prayers are with them.|
042033|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_315.wav|||So other options had to be explored.|
035650|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_195.wav|||It is a scandal.|
030866|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_030.wav|||It is a very special city.|
041792|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_073.wav|||I am going to win the next two.|

031804|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_122.wav|||But once again it was not converted.|
030033|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_390.wav|||The package has been properly costed.|
028075|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_328.wav|||Maybe it helps us.|
034274|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_066.wav|||He got his degree.|
036725|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|

031920|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_238.wav|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
028429|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_283.wav|||Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.|
027427|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_085.wav|||Israel has done very little until now.|
041456|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_161.wav|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
029707|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_064.wav|||This rule is archaic.|
027423|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_081.wav|||You can't keep them separate.|
038075|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_089.wav|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
027732|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_390.wav|||And the funny thing is, they usually do.|
039845|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_216.wav|||And we will do it.|
037047|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_325.wav|||It was a UK-wide report.|
034253|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_045.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
036569|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_269.wav|||It was very frightened and dirty.|
038887|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_055.wav|||I've just got to do this.|
035742|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_287.wav|||Now, she has completed a family tradition.|
031101|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_265.wav|||We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|
028372|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_226.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
035649|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_194.wav|||The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|
030352|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_294.wav|||In the old days, it was easy.|
040986|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_114.wav|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
034452|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_244.wav|||This was done by the council staff.|
036417|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_116.wav|||Henry was strong and talented.|
034348|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_140.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
036667|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_368.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
040874|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
025816|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_136.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|
026094|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_415.wav|||I don't entirely buy that.|
027566|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_224.wav|||But the row refused to go away.|
027956|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_209.wav|||That night was a terrible muddle.|

036629|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_330.wav|||Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|
036802|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_079.wav|||Maybe that was the whole point.|
028468|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_322.wav|||It's a record label, not a form of music.|
026558|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_039.wav|||Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.|
039133|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_302.wav|||But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|

034287|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_079.wav|||They must be kept on the ground.|
031569|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
028239|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_093.wav|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
030257|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_195.wav|||I would like Glasgow.|

041095|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_223.wav|||We are not conducting the review.|
040948|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_076.wav|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
039136|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_305.wav|||However, there are also many areas of agreement.|
038258|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_273.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
037082|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_360.wav|||This man is serious about his work.|

028025|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_278.wav|||That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.|
