038534|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_060.wav|||But what did it matter?|
041551|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_193.wav|||There are some good people in there.|
037605|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_395.wav|||His condition was stable last night.|
037191|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_404.wav|||She said he showed no remorse.|
036205|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_262.wav|||I have no argument with Scotland.|
032517|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_346.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
040249|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_133.wav|||I don't know where that one came from.|
039347|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_027.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|
031920|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_172.wav|||His track record is not promising.|
042162|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_381.wav|||They will give it a couple of years.|

031535|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_210.wav|||I was surprised by his response.|
039491|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_172.wav|||In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|
039634|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_316.wav|||I thought he was part of the camera.|
036924|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_135.wav|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|

030675|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_120.wav|||However, it very nearly all went wrong.|
042182|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_401.wav|||It was cynical and callous.|
030889|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_341.wav|||We won't let you down.|
039545|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_226.wav|||That's the day job.|

027285|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_280.wav|||It may have been a cry for help.|
037529|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_319.wav|||It's ahead of Labour.|
026571|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_400.wav|||Of course, it doesn't all come off.|

030155|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

038872|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_399.wav|||It is about more than Scotland.|
036446|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_079.wav|||I could do a better job.|
041657|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_299.wav|||Why have you decided to get married?|
028160|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_326.wav|||Lambert will be playing against Belgium.|
027147|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_139.wav|||It's not a great art.|
032588|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_417.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
030805|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_255.wav|||The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.|
028713|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_076.wav|||This is a mental challenge.|

038477|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.|
040219|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_103.wav|||This is his personal life.|
041987|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_206.wav|||We will be working on that this week, all right.|
039459|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_140.wav|||They really did a great job.|

037277|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_066.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
028698|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_061.wav|||That is why we want this decision reversed.|
026345|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_173.wav|||It was little else.|
037240|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_029.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
038720|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_247.wav|||Did it work?|

027265|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_260.wav|||I'm the one who has to suffer.|
039702|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_384.wav|||We only lost the third goal.|

036794|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042417|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_213.wav|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
035995|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_052.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
032460|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_289.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
028071|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_237.wav|||I hate the word.|
032162|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_415.wav|||The film is about the cost of genius.|
028041|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_207.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
038635|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_162.wav|||More cases are expected.|
036679|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_312.wav|||It was a cry for help.|
041451|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_093.wav|||That's what makes it interesting.|
037622|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_412.wav|||Sub Not Used, McArthur.|
031514|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_189.wav|||People buy everything with cash.|
030689|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_134.wav|||There is still much work to be done.|
031993|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_246.wav|||And thought we would get away with it.|
032438|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_267.wav|||There is no signature.|
039494|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_175.wav|||Of course he is.|
034765|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
032352|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_181.wav|||That will help my case a bit.|
028546|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_308.wav|||He is a law unto himself.|
032261|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_090.wav|||It is a very special place.|
042607|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_403.wav|||It's going to be great!|
040502|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_389.wav|||It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|
036406|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_039.wav|||Or so she thought.|
042077|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_296.wav|||What do you think?|
035997|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_054.wav|||She has a wonderful mind.|
027330|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_325.wav|||It's only tackling congestion.|
039637|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_319.wav|||This is very bad news.|
030595|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_039.wav|||A further police inquiry is currently being held.|
042580|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_376.wav|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
027923|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_089.wav|||The death rates are still as high.|
030456|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_322.wav|||I just could not cope.|
036499|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_132.wav|||They want to avoid a flashpoint.|
040182|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_066.wav|||That is part of athletics.|
034877|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
036420|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_053.wav|||I was never going to play against Scotland.|
032104|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_357.wav|||He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.|
028084|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_250.wav|||When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|
031997|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_250.wav|||I would urge the Government to think again.|
027232|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_225.wav|||It was more like a Labour Party rally.|
026384|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_212.wav|||I have no secrets.|
038761|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_288.wav|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
041620|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_262.wav|||He could still be President.|
026301|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_129.wav|||They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|
028987|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_350.wav|||And Michael was just great.|
027295|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_290.wav|||Taxation should be simplified.|
036230|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_287.wav|||Now, she has completed a family tradition.|
031626|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_301.wav|||Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.|
036991|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_202.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
036353|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_410.wav|||He also admitted possessing a firearm.|
036777|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_410.wav|||What does he want him to look like?|
034983|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_286.wav|||We are talking about the outskirts of London.|
027901|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_067.wav|||Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.|
028485|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_247.wav|||The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.|
034766|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_069.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
042260|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_055.wav|||He is one of them.|
030603|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_047.wav|||But the law is very clear on this.|
041981|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_200.wav|||On the face of it, this is excellent news.|
042142|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_361.wav|||I am very sorry to be here.|
040351|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_235.wav|||Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|
032208|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_037.wav|||They did a very good job.|
038590|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_117.wav|||There are exciting days ahead.|
027854|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040172|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_056.wav|||We expect them to deliver for us.|
040164|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_048.wav|||The opposite is the case.|
036024|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_081.wav|||I was there for five hours.|
026385|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_213.wav|||We are very, very pleased with the response.|
032163|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_416.wav|||They've been here before.|
038601|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_128.wav|||But it was not just the land.|
026411|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_239.wav|||Do it for us now.|
027911|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_077.wav|||How can they say that?|
036990|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_201.wav|||Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.|
028741|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_104.wav|||I needed a change, a new challenge.|
041518|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_160.wav|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
039353|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_033.wav|||Everything was up for grabs.|
028397|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_159.wav|||They thought they had found a home.|
036221|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_278.wav|||He has been campaigning for change for years.|
042440|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_236.wav|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
028506|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_268.wav|||Once they go away they won't come back.|
037192|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_405.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
028963|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_326.wav|||It needs to be sorted out by Easter.|
030672|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_117.wav|||Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.|
036315|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_372.wav|||The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.|
036438|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_071.wav|||It is also very valuable.|
042212|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037314|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_103.wav|||We should just say no.|
036236|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_293.wav|||It was nice to get a clean sheet.|
027218|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_210.wav|||He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
037501|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_291.wav|||We haven't actually considered it down here.|
032196|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_025.wav|||No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.|
041859|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_077.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
036356|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_413.wav|||They have the cash to do that.|
026388|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_216.wav|||We're very, very excited.|
026527|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_356.wav|||So far he has not done so.|
031734|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_409.wav|||I have no argument with Scotland.|
027313|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_308.wav|||I can understand why they have gone.|
041690|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_332.wav|||I don't think he played his best.|
030809|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_259.wav|||It's the stop-gap before extinction.|
031377|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_052.wav|||He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.|
031810|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_062.wav|||We're into that build-up now.|
034915|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_218.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
028979|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_342.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
038538|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_064.wav|||The police are not the target.|
041533|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_175.wav|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
042378|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_173.wav|||An inquiry has begun.|
030300|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_166.wav|||The home team also had their moments.|
031813|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_065.wav|||I have had no social life at all.|
026176|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041399|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_041.wav|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|
039558|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_240.wav|||Bill is a mentor.|
027092|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_083.wav|||Its first awards will do just that.|
034853|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_156.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
028836|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_199.wav|||Frankly, it was worth the booking.|
030320|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_186.wav|||Angola was a really hard place.|
030581|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_025.wav|||Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|
031746|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_421.wav|||The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.|
035063|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_366.wav|||The idea was presented to me.|
030207|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_073.wav|||I've put my own money into this project.|
042160|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_379.wav|||It's about New Yorkers.|
031409|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_084.wav|||I never won a penny throughout my career.|
041743|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_385.wav|||I didn't do it.|
041941|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_160.wav|||That is the sensible outcome.|
030230|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_096.wav|||We must keep our feet on the ground.|
035112|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_415.wav|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
042289|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_084.wav|||She is now on the back benches.|
036653|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_286.wav|||She was shouting my baby, my baby.|
038634|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_161.wav|||What were they told?|
032078|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_331.wav|||Then we will face the Danish champions.|
027857|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042465|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_261.wav|||I can't deny that fact.|
031533|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_208.wav|||Which means it matters.|
032437|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_266.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
040284|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_168.wav|||But it won't be the same.|
030399|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_265.wav|||Our offer will remain on the table.|
036872|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_083.wav|||All of us do.|
032488|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_317.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
028721|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_084.wav|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
034769|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
035067|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_370.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
028951|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_314.wav|||It sounds a bit of an own goal.|
041523|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_165.wav|||We're very unhappy about it.|
040131|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041954|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_173.wav|||Can he do it?|
037466|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_256.wav|||My players have no idea about football.|
028722|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_085.wav|||I knew he would play two weeks ago.|
036182|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_239.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
034882|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_185.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
041597|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_239.wav|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
039591|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_273.wav|||Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|
037588|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_378.wav|||Here we have not had one hour.|
036529|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_162.wav|||The party lasted all night.|
031575|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_250.wav|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
041383|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_025.wav|||You can never take a win for granted.|
039487|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_168.wav|||Look at his last couple of records.|
042129|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_348.wav|||And that was the real problem.|
031802|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_054.wav|||They were not defeated.|
038851|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_378.wav|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
039556|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_238.wav|||We believe we have a strong case.|
036807|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
026236|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_064.wav|||It is all about having physical evidence.|
028942|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_305.wav|||That it is a brand name.|
032384|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_213.wav|||It had to be more flexible.|
041757|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_399.wav|||These were the edited highlights.|
028455|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_217.wav|||I told you, you were doing it all wrong.|
042270|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_065.wav|||She had no chance.|
038645|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_172.wav|||It all depends on the wind.|
036100|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_157.wav|||I have great respect for all my players.|
028719|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_082.wav|||However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.|
037555|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_345.wav|||She wondered why we were interested.|
040282|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_166.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
031612|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_287.wav|||I'd love to be like Peter.|
036605|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_238.wav|||We have great team spirit.|
028755|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_118.wav|||Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.|
028874|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_237.wav|||Why does she suddenly win everything now?|
030840|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_292.wav|||Everyone knew where they were.|
042312|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_107.wav|||The task is enormous.|
040118|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
038877|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_404.wav|||I'm delighted with our performance.|
041976|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_195.wav|||You look at that.|
030558|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042481|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_277.wav|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
040334|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_218.wav|||But we are losing that connection.|
034710|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032288|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_117.wav|||They are all Arabs.|
030409|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_275.wav|||I am now just a bit uneasy.|
031947|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_200.wav|||They responded with victories.|
031625|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_300.wav|||The frustration was showing.|
030295|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_161.wav|||But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.|
028711|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_074.wav|||The next thing will be cutting journey times.|
035062|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_365.wav|||They took a risk.|
037259|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_048.wav|||Times have changed, but have they improved?|
041704|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_346.wav|||We are working so hard.|
042494|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_290.wav|||Yet it seemed to work.|
028095|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_261.wav|||And we still have to pay his salary.|

028955|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_318.wav|||However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.|
032175|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041524|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_166.wav|||A good actor doesn't think.|
026267|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_095.wav|||Was it a signal?|
036517|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_150.wav|||It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.|
027073|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_062.wav|||It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.|
027126|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_118.wav|||It's too big a risk to take.|
028355|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_116.wav|||He was the deputy editor at the paper.|
028657|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039671|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_353.wav|||I can't stop people thinking.|
042277|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_072.wav|||And it was this one.|
030363|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_229.wav|||Gilbert was not amused.|
039611|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_293.wav|||Now we need to keep our heads up.|
040191|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_075.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
030460|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_326.wav|||He made so many bad decisions.|
041863|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_081.wav|||Kenny Miller might come through.|
041805|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
026211|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_039.wav|||He got the same story.|
027982|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_148.wav|||These matters are now behind us.|
035055|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_358.wav|||Closure is not one of them.|
042184|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_403.wav|||What sort of man is that?|
028227|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_393.wav|||We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.|
032176|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
037464|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_254.wav|||Check that he is dead.|
039499|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_180.wav|||The crackdown is launched today by the government.|
036268|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_325.wav|||Pressure of work is no excuse.|
030600|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_044.wav|||We like being the underdogs.|
039705|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_387.wav|||No-one has yet been charged.|
037574|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_364.wav|||It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|
034733|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
032593|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_422.wav|||It's something we want to make work.|
040353|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_237.wav|||Rangers are my life.|
036515|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_148.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
027894|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_060.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|
028581|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_343.wav|||Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|
041928|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_147.wav|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
032465|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
034989|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_292.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
039543|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_224.wav|||Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|
040117|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
028670|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_033.wav|||However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|
032567|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_396.wav|||She is fulfilled by it.|
031649|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_324.wav|||They would be wise to do just that.|
036696|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_329.wav|||I am not in denial.|
032355|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_184.wav|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
028662|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_025.wav|||But it was a great decision he joked.|
042084|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
036018|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_075.wav|||This will be no easy option.|
037119|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_332.wav|||That is as it may be.|
034813|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
036378|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
028261|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
030216|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_082.wav|||But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.|
028092|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_258.wav|||I'm just doing artwork.|
030223|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_089.wav|||If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?|
034811|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_114.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
032097|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_350.wav|||Or do they?|
028264|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_025.wav|||Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|
037021|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_233.wav|||That is very, very bad news for our nation.|
031896|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_148.wav|||Each one has its own system.|
030511|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_377.wav|||Farmers have been an endangered species.|
034737|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_040.wav|||They hit me in the head.|

039511|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_192.wav|||Who is he?|
028295|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_056.wav|||It comes on like a tidal wave.|
036164|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_221.wav|||But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.|
032487|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_316.wav|||This is not out of choice.|
040408|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_293.wav|||Somebody has to speak up for common sense.|
030154|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
036755|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_388.wav|||That would open the gates of hell.|
028301|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_062.wav|||This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|
034875|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_178.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
032265|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_094.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
037075|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_287.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
042615|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_411.wav|||We want everyone to have a good time.|
030802|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_252.wav|||I just saw them for a few minutes.|
032235|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_064.wav|||The scientific debate is dead.|
031708|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_383.wav|||It's like a garage.|
031861|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_113.wav|||But there is another side.|
039495|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_176.wav|||This is a very positive step forward.|
037305|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_094.wav|||Libya is an easy target.|
031789|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_041.wav|||Buying our way out is not an option.|
028644|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
028801|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_164.wav|||I thought it was a fantastic game.|
042250|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_045.wav|||His style is suited to Scottish football.|
032257|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_086.wav|||My wife and family are the support system.|
031944|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_197.wav|||Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|
028349|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_110.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
036493|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_126.wav|||It's like a high school play.|
039631|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_313.wav|||Calderwood would agree with that.|
042336|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_131.wav|||Stewart will travel with some confidence.|
032269|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_098.wav|||He's got me very well.|
032300|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_129.wav|||The hearing was continued until a later date.|
041922|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_141.wav|||I'm sure he will be aware of it.|
026371|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_199.wav|||That's been the case for a while.|
028435|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_197.wav|||We have only nine months to go.|
028667|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_030.wav|||He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.|
038541|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_067.wav|||And he's not a bigot.|
040508|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_395.wav|||I won't go back to Holland.|
028024|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_190.wav|||This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|
027086|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_077.wav|||Raised the way you want it.|
031560|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_235.wav|||But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|
041474|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_116.wav|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
030738|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_186.wav|||A bit of match fitness is required.|
036569|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_202.wav|||There was no time scale.|
027964|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_130.wav|||They really did a great job.|
034725|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_028.wav|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
037079|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_291.wav|||It is just too long since the war.|
027219|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_211.wav|||That's hard for a woman.|
039414|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_094.wav|||We are losing this war.|

038581|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_108.wav|||I don't know what we're doing wrong.|
039534|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_215.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
037463|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_253.wav|||I'm getting back up there now.|
031851|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_103.wav|||In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.|
027061|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_050.wav|||At the time, he was a living legend.|
036002|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_059.wav|||Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|
042039|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_258.wav|||He will appear in court today.|
038719|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_246.wav|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
034783|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_086.wav|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
040359|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_243.wav|||There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|
039518|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_199.wav|||What's the big idea?|
037124|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_337.wav|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
028187|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_353.wav|||I am ready for that.|
039334|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
036099|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_156.wav|||There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|
038537|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_063.wav|||I am not retaining him.|
036387|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
030406|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_272.wav|||He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|
041380|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032375|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_204.wav|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
040210|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_094.wav|||It was a funny feeling.|
037289|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_078.wav|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
038550|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_076.wav|||A review is under way.|
030410|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_276.wav|||However, Sharon rejected the claims.|
032182|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
031885|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_137.wav|||People can describe a moment in their life.|
032058|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
030899|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_354.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
028275|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_036.wav|||He said he now intends to fly today.|
030318|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_184.wav|||The attacker died in the crash.|
032331|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_160.wav|||At least two women were among those arrested.|
030742|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_190.wav|||The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.|
027059|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_048.wav|||What do we do for an encore?|
032369|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_198.wav|||It is that sort of film.|
032148|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_401.wav|||It is a catalogue of obstruction.|
035119|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
040320|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_204.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
035955|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
028624|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_387.wav|||Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.|
041541|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_183.wav|||You have to wait.|
030158|en-305-f|en|wav/p305_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
030867|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_319.wav|||I tend to not look back.|
037387|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_177.wav|||The new system will be marketed this summer.|
038505|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_031.wav|||It's about the balance.|
036080|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_137.wav|||I felt under no pressure today.|
036715|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_348.wav|||It was a poor performance.|
042398|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_193.wav|||This is a business.|
036066|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_123.wav|||They are so easy for youngsters to open.|
036647|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_280.wav|||Who would take it now, after all this?|
042178|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_397.wav|||He was too good for me - too consistent.|
042597|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_393.wav|||My mind was made up.|
034985|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
038666|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_193.wav|||That was very important.|
030679|en-306-f|en|wav/p306_124.wav|||I'm sure this game will be equally successful.|
026285|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_113.wav|||I don't know the nature of the illness.|
028776|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_139.wav|||I'm very puzzled by it.|

028456|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_218.wav|||Roy Keane is certainly the best.|
042605|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_401.wav|||My mother was getting on at me.|
031700|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_375.wav|||Ferguson should take note.|
031636|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_311.wav|||It plans to return to this field.|
036766|en-330-f|en|wav/p330_399.wav|||However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|
037598|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_388.wav|||I just don't know where he is.|
034980|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_283.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
038669|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_196.wav|||It was a very strong metaphor.|
037345|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_134.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
039358|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_038.wav|||There is no escape.|
028897|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_260.wav|||That's the sort of game you want.|
037521|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_311.wav|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
028631|en-300-f|en|wav/p300_394.wav|||The award was a lifeline for me.|
038582|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_109.wav|||It was all over now.|
040222|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_106.wav|||It's as eventful as it is momentous.|
034967|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_270.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
031458|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_133.wav|||I was just overwhelmed.|

028770|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_133.wav|||Both were later released after a check-up.|
042064|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_283.wav|||But it's the truth.|
029015|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_378.wav|||There is no openness.|
037455|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_245.wav|||Is that Titanic?|
