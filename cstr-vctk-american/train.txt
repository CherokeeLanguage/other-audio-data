036604|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_304.wav|||It is a very special city.|
031030|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_194.wav|||Or so we have long assumed.|
039702|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_073.wav|||Everyone was writing me off.|
027942|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_195.wav|||I would like Glasgow.|
041038|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_166.wav|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041910|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_191.wav|||I think he's done it a few times.|
026920|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_407.wav|||One policeman was killed.|
038023|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_037.wav|||I don't think the action was a mistake.|
027470|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_128.wav|||I was pleased with my own game.|
042072|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_354.wav|||We are delighted with the result.|
039877|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_248.wav|||It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|
029903|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_260.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
026863|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_350.wav|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
035990|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_111.wav|||You just know it.|
041800|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_081.wav|||I have to accept that.|
036477|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_176.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
036914|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_192.wav|||Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|
027971|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_224.wav|||There is nothing like this back home.|
036599|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_299.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
041565|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_270.wav|||Full back was a bit of the unknown.|
025911|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_231.wav|||General, You didn't get a modified.|
036121|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_242.wav|||You would fall over, he said.|
030055|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_412.wav|||Such people do not exist.|
026685|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_169.wav|||I'm going to buy a car.|
027631|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_289.wav|||But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.|
027838|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_091.wav|||He then had a swipe at Hearts.|
028454|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_308.wav|||They will have to make changes.|
027806|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_059.wav|||He was taken ill in December last year.|
031032|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_196.wav|||To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|
036729|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
030096|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_031.wav|||I don't believe you own anything.|
038844|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
030201|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_137.wav|||One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.|
030052|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_409.wav|||Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.|
027793|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_046.wav|||We will continue to operate within the sport.|
026060|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_381.wav|||It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.|
041432|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_137.wav|||It was highly successful.|
036025|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_146.wav|||I never thought it would take this long.|
030838|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
039963|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_335.wav|||Stock markets will be watching closely.|
037039|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_317.wav|||It seems a little short to me.|
038004|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
035678|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_223.wav|||I'm really happy with the way it went.|
041109|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_237.wav|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
030397|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_339.wav|||But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|
031155|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_319.wav|||I'm getting back up there now.|
029728|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_085.wav|||The jury is still out.|
030010|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_367.wav|||Last month he made his debut in Japan.|
031410|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_151.wav|||And that was the adults.|
028253|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_107.wav|||The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.|
038044|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_058.wav|||We need to do that every week.|
031391|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_132.wav|||Britain may now be forced to listen.|
039840|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_211.wav|||Drugs are getting through.|
035616|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_161.wav|||It will be a great night.|
039868|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_239.wav|||Three weeks later, he resigned.|
041666|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_371.wav|||Well, you don't have time.|
029860|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_217.wav|||He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|
039087|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_256.wav|||Mind you, who wouldn't?|
026599|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_082.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
041680|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_385.wav|||Father is on the train.|
028387|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_241.wav|||That is nearly four people every day.|
041225|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_353.wav|||This is a moment to seize.|
041057|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_185.wav|||It's their moment of choice.|
040911|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_039.wav|||I'm so grateful for that.|
041398|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_102.wav|||I welcome the decision.|
042075|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_357.wav|||The programme was awful.|
030068|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
036718|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_419.wav|||They were in good humour, too.|
026034|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_355.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
031228|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_392.wav|||I find it puzzling and disturbing.|
027885|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_138.wav|||We were with him the whole time.|
031549|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_291.wav|||We make good weapons.|
036493|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_192.wav|||I have been very nervous.|
026085|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_406.wav|||It was very well received.|
039761|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_132.wav|||The whole matter is done and dusted.|
030263|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_202.wav|||Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?|
026628|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_112.wav|||We are just being flooded.|
036069|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_190.wav|||We're not an employment agency.|
036334|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_033.wav|||So now this series has had its day.|
031323|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_064.wav|||We shall not do that.|
028488|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_342.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
029733|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_090.wav|||His handling raises a wider issue.|
030416|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_360.wav|||She looked very, very poor.|
031518|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_260.wav|||That is my role.|
041860|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_141.wav|||That is my dream.|
029727|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_084.wav|||This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.|
039861|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_232.wav|||This is my homeland.|
030058|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_415.wav|||She always wanted her own way.|
031536|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_278.wav|||Well, when did he ever refuse?|
031200|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_364.wav|||I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.|
027519|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_177.wav|||His signature is his handwriting.|
025797|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_117.wav|||And she got it.|
036020|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_141.wav|||No Briton has ever won.|
031011|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_175.wav|||It is time to come into the limelight.|
034365|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_157.wav|||I am not blaming audiences.|
036081|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_202.wav|||There was no time scale.|
025851|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_171.wav|||We have a genuine budget in place.|
041698|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_403.wav|||What sort of man is that?|
036345|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_044.wav|||Nobody else was with me.|
027402|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_060.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|
027983|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_236.wav|||The success story shows no signs of stopping.|
034467|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
029655|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041336|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_040.wav|||Why you did it will never be known.|
041835|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_116.wav|||He is involved in everything.|
035930|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_051.wav|||This was the classical period of Beethoven.|
031091|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_255.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
036814|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_091.wav|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
030365|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_307.wav|||They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.|
029667|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
031742|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_060.wav|||His third goal was superb.|
028411|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_265.wav|||He was telling me to keep quiet.|
034420|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_212.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
035703|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_248.wav|||We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|
029701|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_058.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
039181|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_350.wav|||He takes time out for everyone.|
041236|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_364.wav|||That gives it a spirit.|
041142|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_270.wav|||He is having a nightmare.|
041545|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_250.wav|||Nothing was meant by it.|
026865|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_352.wav|||It is only one night, after all.|
028140|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_394.wav|||The award was a lifeline for me.|
027372|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_030.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
036709|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_410.wav|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
031492|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_234.wav|||Look at the table.|
039754|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_125.wav|||Our intentions are real.|
027481|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_139.wav|||I had a tie in my hand.|
041656|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_361.wav|||I am very sorry to be here.|
036486|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_185.wav|||This area is perfect for children.|
030139|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_074.wav|||What are you supposed to do, just walk away?|
034377|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_169.wav|||But what are the songs about?|
028048|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_301.wav|||He was then replaced by Ross.|
036646|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_347.wav|||For now, we must take one game at a time.|
029959|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_316.wav|||It is still holding good today.|
037058|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_336.wav|||So just what is her enduring appeal?|
036407|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_106.wav|||I know a lot of people who don't.|
027835|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_088.wav|||They had to be cut from the wreckage.|
029892|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_249.wav|||We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|
031198|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_362.wav|||So just what is her enduring appeal?|
038963|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_131.wav|||You can see their point.|
031069|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_233.wav|||There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|
041150|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_278.wav|||The warning is timely.|
037031|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_309.wav|||Again, it's about responding to your resources.|
038924|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_092.wav|||Israel has done very little until now.|
039674|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_045.wav|||We would certainly consider the proposals.|
041423|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_127.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
038095|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_110.wav|||But it was only a matter of time.|
041084|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_212.wav|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
030152|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_087.wav|||We do need a new one.|
031396|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_137.wav|||People can describe a moment in their life.|
026630|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_114.wav|||It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.|
036978|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_256.wav|||My players have no idea about football.|
039760|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_131.wav|||It certainly should not be used too often.|
028073|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_326.wav|||She is now on the back benches.|
030404|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_346.wav|||English is the language of pop music.|
034388|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
036027|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_148.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
039231|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_400.wav|||She can't say where she was, what she did.|
031527|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_269.wav|||I think it is totally wrong.|
026734|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_219.wav|||I'm looking at ways to do that now.|
028284|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_138.wav|||The son has autism and other problems.|
035997|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_118.wav|||Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.|
041032|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_160.wav|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
039783|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_154.wav|||Normally it would be four minutes.|
036607|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_307.wav|||It's my favourite place to hang out.|
027433|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_091.wav|||There is a growing anger among the group.|
036378|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_077.wav|||They had not been handcuffed.|
036181|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_302.wav|||Chris is big and jolly.|
030364|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_306.wav|||Their message was simple.|
031356|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_097.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|
041127|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_255.wav|||Who would have thought it?|
041103|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_231.wav|||We've got better players here.|
030955|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_119.wav|||It ignores the future.|
038064|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_078.wav|||Maybe he will act again.|
039739|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_110.wav|||I would probably have to agree with him.|
038133|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_148.wav|||Sadly, he has a point.|
027775|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_028.wav|||The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.|
035665|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_210.wav|||What did they think of her voice?|
036603|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_303.wav|||I made a mistake.|
034549|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_341.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
039006|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_174.wav|||They will know they deserve to be there.|
041598|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
035862|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_407.wav|||He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|
026776|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_263.wav|||But something has been lost in the translation.|
041710|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_415.wav|||We told them in July.|
030225|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_162.wav|||Laura is an investment banker.|
041829|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_110.wav|||There have been so many.|
027447|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_105.wav|||I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|
026773|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_260.wav|||I'm the one who has to suffer.|
029702|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_059.wav|||Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.|
038293|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_308.wav|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
039183|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_352.wav|||They are just bewildered and very concerned.|
040014|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_386.wav|||It is quite simple.|
032028|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_346.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
032081|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_399.wav|||It is the end of an era.|

028490|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_344.wav|||We were lucky to have survived.|
027922|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_175.wav|||You cannot eat in the dining room.|
034526|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_318.wav|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
034520|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_312.wav|||I am not a paedophile.|
035520|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_065.wav|||It was the same old story.|
036631|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_332.wav|||That is as it may be.|
029852|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_209.wav|||Others were even less confident.|
031005|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_169.wav|||We must put a marker down.|
036441|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_140.wav|||No-one else is like Michael Jackson.|
035542|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_087.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|
035879|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_424.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
026688|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_172.wav|||I'm not talking about his career.|
028001|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_254.wav|||People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.|
025970|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_291.wav|||There did not need to be a miracle.|
041108|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_236.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041986|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_268.wav|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
036218|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_339.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
025899|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_219.wav|||Then they killed another three.|
029853|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_210.wav|||It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|
035967|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_088.wav|||I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.|
041631|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_336.wav|||When you think you cannot go on, you can.|
038394|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_409.wav|||What would you ask?|
028552|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_406.wav|||Jackson may well be right.|
036479|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_178.wav|||I didn't mean to kill her.|
038157|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_172.wav|||It all depends on the wind.|
038326|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_341.wav|||Let's not make that mistake again.|
038382|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_397.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
031469|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_211.wav|||He is a Satan.|
026041|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_362.wav|||Europe is a bonus.|
030893|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_057.wav|||I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|
029940|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_297.wav|||This is a very positive step forward.|
030203|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_139.wav|||From then on, Scott has never looked back.|
027445|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_103.wav|||He had a heart problem.|
036046|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_167.wav|||I was proud of our lads.|
038120|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_135.wav|||That question was never asked.|
030061|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_418.wav|||She can't say where she was, what she did.|
030977|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_141.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
041375|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_079.wav|||We have never been short of volunteers.|
029878|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_235.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
031217|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_381.wav|||That is not just my personal view.|
027928|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_181.wav|||This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.|
038325|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_340.wav|||Charges against the pair were found not proven.|
027558|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_216.wav|||They were both very brave.|
027689|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_347.wav|||The science is well known, the solution is simple.|
041476|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_181.wav|||That's not the way to think.|
039943|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_315.wav|||Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|
042093|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_375.wav|||Maybe his time has gone.|
039176|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_345.wav|||I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.|
036639|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_340.wav|||The stadium was full.|
030925|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_089.wav|||It's a flourishing and beautiful city.|
040943|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_071.wav|||What happens next?|
026067|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_388.wav|||But what is?|
026675|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_159.wav|||The captaincy will help that, too.|
031389|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_130.wav|||Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|
041816|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_097.wav|||Well, was it?|
039669|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_040.wav|||Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.|
027704|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_362.wav|||It was to get even better for Motherwell.|
034496|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
036685|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_386.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
027609|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_267.wav|||We knew nothing about it.|
035909|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_030.wav|||It was nothing to do with my daughter.|
039072|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_241.wav|||They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|
041447|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_152.wav|||This series is for real.|
026086|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_407.wav|||I don't think there's going to be one.|
036363|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_062.wav|||The chief constable is right.|
041956|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_238.wav|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
038076|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_090.wav|||In fact, he took it very well.|
029924|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_281.wav|||They really did a great job.|
025977|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_298.wav|||Who will provide the wine?|
038330|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_345.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
041979|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_261.wav|||I can't deny that fact.|
028081|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_334.wav|||We will be homeless.|
025770|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_090.wav|||He had just returned from a run.|
028204|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_058.wav|||The encounter was to change his life.|
025842|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_162.wav|||Such as it is.|
038107|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_122.wav|||There could be a possible connection.|
035694|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_239.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
026052|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_373.wav|||Try to save us.|
031878|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_196.wav|||They were kept there for a summer.|
036082|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_203.wav|||Our message was inclusive.|
034363|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_155.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
031544|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_286.wav|||Is he any good in the kitchen?|
036469|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_168.wav|||They got the job done.|
041400|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_104.wav|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
041347|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_051.wav|||They were taken to prove a point.|
036688|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_389.wav|||Have we not had the rainy season already?|
027883|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_136.wav|||All our thoughts and prayers are with them.|
036782|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_059.wav|||It was totally my fault.|
035798|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_343.wav|||But he is frustrated at every turn.|
030901|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_065.wav|||It is just part of modern day life.|
041480|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_185.wav|||We want to be part of it.|
041184|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_312.wav|||You just have to get on with it.|
026562|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_043.wav|||He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.|
029792|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_149.wav|||They chose to side with terror.|
030041|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_398.wav|||Several people were out in the street.|
039177|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_346.wav|||Barry will be able to handle this.|
041047|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_175.wav|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
038381|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_396.wav|||It is a technique.|
037015|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_293.wav|||He was telling me to keep quiet.|
042063|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_345.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
028331|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_185.wav|||You can say he gets a sizeable amount.|
031299|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_040.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
036574|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_274.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
035535|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_080.wav|||We will see how he is after treatment.|
041726|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041817|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_098.wav|||I thought he was my friend.|
041322|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_026.wav|||That is where the damage has been done.|
041153|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_281.wav|||A press conference is about politics.|
026765|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_250.wav|||That is how it will be judged.|
039136|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_305.wav|||However, there are also many areas of agreement.|
041373|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_077.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
031188|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_352.wav|||His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.|
039100|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_269.wav|||It's one up to the Scots.|
029820|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_177.wav|||This is a dream come true for me.|
027753|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031569|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
026925|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_412.wav|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
031493|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_235.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
027972|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_225.wav|||And that gives a kind of freedom.|
040922|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_050.wav|||It is like a football team.|
031729|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_047.wav|||That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|
026075|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_396.wav|||We are on the path of change.|
035565|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_110.wav|||I bought a car at auction.|
035979|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_100.wav|||Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.|
031897|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_215.wav|||It wouldn't go off.|
031690|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042007|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_289.wav|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
030216|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_153.wav|||We need some confidence to get a win.|
041662|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_367.wav|||By hard work, is the answer.|
041770|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_051.wav|||Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|
030907|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_071.wav|||There is no sign of anyone being hurt.|
026820|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_307.wav|||I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|
028258|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_112.wav|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
031751|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_069.wav|||I have a choice.|
036092|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_213.wav|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
030413|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_357.wav|||I've only met him three times.|
028347|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_201.wav|||Well, what do you know?|
029645|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
027784|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_037.wav|||This means that our programme is quite unusual.|
030141|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_076.wav|||Henman is taking nothing for granted.|
039931|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_303.wav|||Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|
027816|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_069.wav|||Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.|
028137|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_391.wav|||Form and structure are his music.|
041588|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_293.wav|||Well, that's all right then.|
036961|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_239.wav|||This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.|
042077|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_359.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
026750|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_235.wav|||Some were close to tears.|
031145|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_309.wav|||If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|
025997|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_318.wav|||Now they have found out the truth.|
037096|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_374.wav|||They are a very powerful and tasty side.|
038258|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_273.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
036984|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_262.wav|||That, he claimed, was essential.|
031359|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_100.wav|||After that nothing could save him.|
040006|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_378.wav|||I did not name it.|
026846|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_333.wav|||He intends to appeal the sentences.|
027923|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_176.wav|||It is very difficult to find a buyer.|
035982|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_103.wav|||An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.|
027703|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_361.wav|||What's happening to her?|
040878|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031288|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_029.wav|||Did you see that?|
035848|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_393.wav|||My father died in childbirth.|
039663|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_034.wav|||We had to laugh.|
036715|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_416.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
037012|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_290.wav|||I want to keep him.|
036967|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_245.wav|||Is that Titanic?|
031855|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_173.wav|||This is a very interesting move.|
030319|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_259.wav|||It's the stop-gap before extinction.|
032087|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_405.wav|||It was the same old story.|
028197|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_051.wav|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
030019|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_376.wav|||I thought he was part of the camera.|
036298|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_419.wav|||This is about the Orange Order.|
041002|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_130.wav|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
035695|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_240.wav|||They were on holiday in Egypt.|
042036|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_318.wav|||It is good news for us.|
041288|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_416.wav|||It's not an impression.|
031743|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_061.wav|||I don't have a problem with getting older.|
041865|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_146.wav|||Who is going to pay their wages?|
035812|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_357.wav|||You don't do the same thing with men.|
034512|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_304.wav|||I am not a fan of books.|
027996|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_249.wav|||He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.|
028069|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_322.wav|||Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|
025943|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_264.wav|||It possibly depends on the position.|
029965|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_322.wav|||I just could not cope.|
034347|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_139.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
027444|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_102.wav|||This is thought to mean sometime next week.|
041715|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_420.wav|||We certainly do not intend to disband.|
027380|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_038.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
041612|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_317.wav|||The concerns were unfounded.|
026006|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_327.wav|||Is that what people we want?|
036605|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_305.wav|||A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|
031227|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_391.wav|||Would you take them?|
039977|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_349.wav|||I saw one body.|
026655|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_139.wav|||It's not a great art.|

038028|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_042.wav|||It was electric, amazing.|
041665|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_370.wav|||They haven't got the uniform.|
031593|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_335.wav|||There was barely a handful of chances.|
039882|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_253.wav|||THE waiting game continues.|
036784|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_061.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
038972|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_140.wav|||They really did a great job.|
041576|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_281.wav|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
029742|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_099.wav|||I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|
041126|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_254.wav|||It seems a shame to leave it.|
041812|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_093.wav|||Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|
039162|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_331.wav|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
040017|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_391.wav|||There is ample evidence.|
041996|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_278.wav|||But it was to no avail.|
028000|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_253.wav|||A management agreement, however, was conceded.|
041442|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_147.wav|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
032025|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_343.wav|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
036094|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_215.wav|||It had to be more flexible.|
028427|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_281.wav|||This will secure the future of our industry.|
040948|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_076.wav|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
038315|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_330.wav|||We have expected it.|
036385|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_084.wav|||But will they fall in love?|
027350|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037043|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_321.wav|||I welcome this new service.|
030941|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_105.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
028309|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_163.wav|||This is a United Kingdom.|
035861|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_406.wav|||I want a free vote.|
025956|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_277.wav|||From there, it was a success story.|
035884|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
031987|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_305.wav|||That was me today.|
041786|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_067.wav|||I don't have a problem with it.|
036661|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_362.wav|||They have two children.|
040001|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_373.wav|||The winner will be announced in December.|
038289|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_304.wav|||He had planned to sell it.|
038089|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_103.wav|||We should not be surprised at that.|
039895|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_267.wav|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
031059|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_223.wav|||I had enough on.|
031103|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_267.wav|||It's a matter of huge concern.|
031333|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_074.wav|||Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.|
039967|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_339.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
030223|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_160.wav|||She collapsed and died a day later.|
031755|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_073.wav|||I have spoken to the skipper.|
039720|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_091.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
026768|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_255.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
030966|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_130.wav|||THE headless man has finally developed a face.|
028125|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_379.wav|||They should have some measure of protection.|
031117|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_281.wav|||We've taken steps to rectify it.|
042102|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_384.wav|||There may be reasons for it.|
036560|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_260.wav|||THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|
029706|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_063.wav|||The father was treated like a criminal, and why?|
027860|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_113.wav|||Look at them after three days of rain.|
028063|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_316.wav|||I've been thinking about it for a year.|
031287|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_028.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
039688|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_059.wav|||They were willing us to get a second.|
025687|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035760|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_305.wav|||Both agreed on the success of the event.|
028310|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_164.wav|||I thought it was a fantastic game.|
031840|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_158.wav|||It's there for people to look at.|
027897|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_150.wav|||Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.|
041242|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_370.wav|||The package is a changing one.|
036310|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
030056|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_413.wav|||We suspect he was pleased.|
034472|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_264.wav|||We are playing them at their own game.|
027880|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_133.wav|||We haven't actually considered it down here.|
036822|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_099.wav|||They chose to side with terror.|
025804|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_124.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
034591|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_383.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
039027|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_195.wav|||Felt good about it.|
027614|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_272.wav|||I have been totally taken aback by this.|
030366|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_308.wav|||He is a law unto himself.|
036156|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_277.wav|||The film has also been superbly designed.|
041625|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_330.wav|||In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|
034266|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_058.wav|||In a way he was.|
031081|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_245.wav|||Mr Miller is married with three children.|
038057|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_071.wav|||It is extremely fortunate.|
027643|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_301.wav|||Now there's an even bigger target.|
035573|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_118.wav|||That is different from being impartial.|
035856|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_401.wav|||We are now open.|
027709|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_367.wav|||Thus the story will continue to thrive.|
028172|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_026.wav|||They changed the world of music.|
031434|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_175.wav|||However, you have just got to adjust it.|
027749|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
029769|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_126.wav|||I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|
041541|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_246.wav|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
030353|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_295.wav|||People will make up their own minds.|
029729|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_086.wav|||He asked me in a tolerance zone.|
031278|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
037072|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_350.wav|||This, too, could provoke a risky business.|
031110|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_274.wav|||He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.|
034335|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_127.wav|||Why is this?|
038951|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_119.wav|||He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|
034430|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_222.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
041939|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_221.wav|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
035759|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_304.wav|||She had kept the news from him.|
031245|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_409.wav|||I have no argument with Scotland.|
042141|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_423.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
031194|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_358.wav|||It could be done by experts and lawyers.|
039167|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_336.wav|||People might not actually want the job.|
034301|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_093.wav|||There's also the point.|
031521|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_263.wav|||It really is taken seriously.|
026645|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_129.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
041852|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_133.wav|||Labour is providing none of these.|
030349|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_291.wav|||It's not even finished.|
026014|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_335.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
028290|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_144.wav|||This was not just incongruous.|
031960|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_278.wav|||The casualties were not named.|
036820|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_097.wav|||It means they actually control the programme.|
041164|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_292.wav|||I am in a good position.|
025690|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
030135|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_070.wav|||This is the way things should be handled.|
038122|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_137.wav|||It was on fire.|
031149|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_313.wav|||To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.|
039833|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_204.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
029697|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_054.wav|||We see little sign of improvement.|
026022|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_343.wav|||There are moments of joy in politics.|
041830|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_111.wav|||Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|
025912|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_232.wav|||I'm not a little girl.|
036288|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_409.wav|||You guys are not out of it yet.|
038186|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_201.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
031646|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_388.wav|||Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|
031208|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_372.wav|||This, too, could prove a risky business.|
032055|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_373.wav|||And then he laughs.|
041627|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_332.wav|||Yet the job is far from over.|
036104|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_225.wav|||But it's just great to have won.|
031950|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_268.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
027524|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_182.wav|||Who is he?|
028423|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_277.wav|||Little Voice is on general release.|
027963|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_216.wav|||Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.|
041316|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
028409|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_263.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
027517|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_175.wav|||Promises were not kept.|
041117|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_245.wav|||We deserved the draw.|
035726|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_271.wav|||I might also completely change the routine.|
035963|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_084.wav|||That is the crunch.|
028518|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_372.wav|||His job was not advertised.|
027466|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_124.wav|||Yet he chose to do something different.|
030140|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_075.wav|||She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.|
038876|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_044.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
036620|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_321.wav|||We are worried about casualties.|
025964|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_285.wav|||He had asked if they had the script.|
036630|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_331.wav|||This Patton will also return.|
038941|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_109.wav|||It was a bit of a struggle today.|
031095|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_259.wav|||Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|
036254|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_375.wav|||I don't know exactly what happened.|
031075|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_239.wav|||They follow him everywhere.|
042088|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_370.wav|||Plot is not the issue.|
030872|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_036.wav|||I wanted the illusion of space and depth.|
031959|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_277.wav|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
027887|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_140.wav|||All manner of precaution and protection are taken.|
039998|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_370.wav|||I don't believe a word of it.|
027676|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_334.wav|||I am not retiring.|
036030|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_151.wav|||They have worked with each other.|
031027|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_191.wav|||It's amazing it happened in the daytime.|
028138|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_392.wav|||I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.|
034580|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_372.wav|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
030001|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_358.wav|||I put the drawing down.|
030851|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041017|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_145.wav|||What's it going to be then?|
036053|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_174.wav|||He didn't have time for any other hobbies.|
026615|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_099.wav|||The scheme is hopelessly failing.|
038265|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_280.wav|||But that's another story.|
027846|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_099.wav|||They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.|
041795|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_076.wav|||The real problem is the Usher Hall.|
031234|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_398.wav|||It was nerve-racking to watch.|
031089|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_253.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
028502|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_356.wav|||We are now setting about finding them.|
039190|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_359.wav|||There is too much at stake for that.|
036955|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_233.wav|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
026714|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_198.wav|||We're trying to get rounded performers.|
030268|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_207.wav|||Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.|
041637|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_342.wav|||It's just not good enough.|
026727|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_211.wav|||That's hard for a woman.|
027393|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_051.wav|||Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.|
028297|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_151.wav|||I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.|
041611|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_316.wav|||I'd never given up on myself.|
039953|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_325.wav|||I am very happy with him.|
030414|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_358.wav|||You see, my back has gone.|
035973|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_094.wav|||He needed seven hours of surgery.|
041912|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_193.wav|||This is a business.|
034578|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_370.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
036440|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_139.wav|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
031748|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_066.wav|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
036878|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_156.wav|||He was not deterred.|
039980|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_352.wav|||Three hours later, the man was free.|
030976|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_140.wav|||How much of a cop out is that?|
037120|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_398.wav|||I'm sure they love it.|
041299|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
031976|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
025718|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_038.wav|||Their ambition is to go back.|
036357|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_056.wav|||The performance was excellent.|

041244|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_372.wav|||Frankly, that's not good enough.|
030012|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_369.wav|||Now there is an even bigger target.|
027688|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_346.wav|||JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.|
039764|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_135.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
036029|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_150.wav|||It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.|

035476|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
036191|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_312.wav|||It was a cry for help.|
027931|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_184.wav|||We believe a third party was involved.|
031264|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|

031528|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_270.wav|||And a film maker was born.|
034357|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_149.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
028386|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_240.wav|||The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|

038863|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_031.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
029991|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_348.wav|||I am astonished by this decision.|

038223|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_238.wav|||We act because we must.|
036379|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_078.wav|||I think we will join the single currency.|
036528|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_228.wav|||But Annika is just amazing.|
041065|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_193.wav|||There are some good people in there.|
041451|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_156.wav|||The driver just insulted me.|
042003|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_285.wav|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
026887|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_374.wav|||I've been thinking about it for a year.|
027479|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_137.wav|||They can be time consuming.|
039756|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_127.wav|||Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.|
034443|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_235.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
038269|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_284.wav|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
039228|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_397.wav|||It was a sell-out.|
035835|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_380.wav|||I never agreed with that.|
027691|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_349.wav|||I can't stop people thinking.|
026722|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_206.wav|||From day one, we were a family.|
038905|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_073.wav|||They had had time for little else.|
031618|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_360.wav|||Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|
041866|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_147.wav|||I don't think we deserved to lose.|
040966|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_094.wav|||It's nice to be involved.|
040904|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_032.wav|||Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|
041608|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_313.wav|||I am not ready to walk away.|
031276|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041233|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_361.wav|||That would be very good for Rangers.|
028369|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_223.wav|||I go home only once.|
034244|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
027476|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_134.wav|||I love you so very much.|
035901|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034375|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_167.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
025991|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_312.wav|||However, it seems that he got it wrong.|
035972|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_093.wav|||This will be great for the young lads.|
027345|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
038049|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_063.wav|||I am not retaining him.|
031804|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_122.wav|||But once again it was not converted.|
027511|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_169.wav|||Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|
030936|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_100.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
028359|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_213.wav|||I would not want to be young again.|
039107|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_276.wav|||Their three other children had died as infants.|
036794|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_071.wav|||But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|
037136|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_414.wav|||We are here for the long term.|
038867|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_035.wav|||I am proud of moments like that.|
039196|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_365.wav|||It was to get even better for Motherwell.|
025944|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_265.wav|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
038060|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_074.wav|||It is surprising to come back this way.|
042091|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_373.wav|||We should not be complacent.|
031319|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_060.wav|||She has a wonderful mind.|
026590|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_072.wav|||It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.|
025786|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_106.wav|||The other conditions were not specified.|
041094|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_222.wav|||It's a creative energy.|
031971|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_289.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
030108|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_043.wav|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|
038937|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_105.wav|||He is a law unto himself.|
028293|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_147.wav|||And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.|
031127|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_291.wav|||His is a success story by any standard.|
031969|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_287.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
039098|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_267.wav|||She became very good at it.|
036418|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_117.wav|||That left a bad taste in my mouth.|
029821|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_178.wav|||He was lying face down in the water.|
036289|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_410.wav|||What does he want him to look like?|
030078|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
027950|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_203.wav|||It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.|
029844|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_201.wav|||The actors just have to say so.|
025962|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_283.wav|||This is our unfinished business.|
040888|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
039902|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_274.wav|||And they still have the final to come.|
036295|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_416.wav|||You have to work with what you've got.|
038110|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_125.wav|||The Scots are great.|
041592|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_297.wav|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
038981|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_149.wav|||I had a tie in my hand.|
029664|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039769|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_140.wav|||It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.|
036194|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_315.wav|||The casualties were not named.|
039235|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_404.wav|||Golf has lost a great character.|
038984|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_152.wav|||Such a city does not exist.|
041713|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_418.wav|||It is a result we should savour.|
032051|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_369.wav|||We have some concerns.|
027795|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_048.wav|||But all forms of the illness are treatable.|
027736|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_394.wav|||If there is default.|
034319|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_111.wav|||It's just one of those things.|
031253|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_417.wav|||Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|
041652|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_357.wav|||We had no idea what was going on.|
030409|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_352.wav|||Who has the second highest?|
041524|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_229.wav|||I just want him to win a tournament.|
031104|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_268.wav|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
030226|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_163.wav|||I took a minibus into town.|
035568|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_113.wav|||It has been hijacked.|
031921|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_239.wav|||It's not a party, no, no.|
027754|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
027982|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_235.wav|||Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.|
027487|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_145.wav|||This has a number of benefits.|
029823|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_180.wav|||So he is open to ideas.|
036072|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_193.wav|||It's not one or the other, you have to have both.|
026720|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_204.wav|||I have played well the past two days.|
038308|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_323.wav|||It wasn't the issue.|
039662|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_033.wav|||It's a lot of pressure on me.|
025789|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_109.wav|||That was the context of his remarks.|
039213|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_382.wav|||We have been working together for some years.|
030294|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_233.wav|||He will become the sovereign.|
036590|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_290.wav|||I have heard the stories from Scotland.|
027436|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_094.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|
026013|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_334.wav|||It's hard, but we have had so much to do.|
027460|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_118.wav|||It is crucial for both teams.|
034539|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_331.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
028015|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_268.wav|||Once they go away they won't come back.|
038084|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_098.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
034283|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_075.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
038935|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_103.wav|||People buy everything with cash.|
034247|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_039.wav|||It helped to get me noticed.|
028236|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_090.wav|||We will learn lessons from what has happened.|
035891|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038948|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_116.wav|||I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|
041473|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_178.wav|||I was just aghast.|
036166|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_287.wav|||He later became a respected High Court judge.|
041332|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_036.wav|||We felt it was sufficient.|
026588|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_070.wav|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
041078|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_206.wav|||No-one has used it since then.|
030021|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_378.wav|||Injury has played a part, but not a big one.|
026862|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_349.wav|||It was all too little, too late.|
041941|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_223.wav|||It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|
038052|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_066.wav|||But that title is a mistake.|
026552|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_033.wav|||Other forces were, however, at work.|
040938|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_066.wav|||Only the bomber was killed.|
041836|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_117.wav|||No person was charged.|
036229|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_350.wav|||That is the consistent approach of the Government.|
034295|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_087.wav|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
031430|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_171.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
036516|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_216.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
037061|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_339.wav|||Last night was a key episode.|
041808|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_089.wav|||There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|
026704|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_188.wav|||I let go the telephone and ran.|
028143|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_397.wav|||A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.|
041640|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_345.wav|||Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.|
038894|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_062.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
034622|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
036344|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_043.wav|||Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.|
041334|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_038.wav|||And this was well known?|
025961|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_282.wav|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
031270|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
031385|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_126.wav|||This is just one example.|
039903|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_275.wav|||Anyone else can apply.|
036597|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_297.wav|||And sooner than we may think.|
031825|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_143.wav|||We've not won anything yet.|
041946|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_228.wav|||Sadly, they did not.|
027941|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_194.wav|||I am considered a teenager.|
031068|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_232.wav|||This is her first senior Scottish selection.|
036302|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_423.wav|||I have no problem with that.|
041463|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_168.wav|||The game was there to be won.|
031884|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_202.wav|||They are now out in the cold.|
029801|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_158.wav|||We are asking the council to think again.|
037112|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_390.wav|||I find it puzzling and disturbing.|
041694|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_399.wav|||This idea is a good starting point.|
031042|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_206.wav|||He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.|
039059|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_227.wav|||Glasgow is going to be open for business.|
040987|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_115.wav|||It has no place in football.|
030196|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_132.wav|||I've always been desperate to play this part.|
038242|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_257.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
035601|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_146.wav|||That left a bad taste in my mouth.|
034407|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_199.wav|||So they will settle again.|
031487|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_229.wav|||I get to work with very good people.|
028299|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_153.wav|||He was forced to quit.|
042132|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_414.wav|||We actually had a laugh about that.|
030884|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_048.wav|||What's it got to do with art?|
038340|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_355.wav|||I thought to myself.|
030279|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_218.wav|||Roy Keane is certainly the best.|
031243|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_407.wav|||No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.|
029759|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_116.wav|||My daughter is an adult.|
038255|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_270.wav|||It is, but that's not the point.|
031331|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_072.wav|||Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|
025909|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_229.wav|||The protest will go ahead as planned.|
034606|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_398.wav|||He says it often enough.|
038092|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_107.wav|||It was a bit of a tightrope.|
031649|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_391.wav|||Have you heard anything from Paramount?|
027539|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_197.wav|||The rear of the plane was on fire.|
030129|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_064.wav|||Robin Williams is very subdued.|
041605|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_310.wav|||I think it's a good sign.|
037059|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_337.wav|||With actors it is slightly different.|
029898|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_255.wav|||He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|
026709|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_193.wav|||After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|
031344|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_085.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|
026927|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_414.wav|||However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|
039993|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_365.wav|||Her life is now back on track.|
036175|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_296.wav|||For now, we must take one game at a time.|
036624|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_325.wav|||After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|
039022|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_190.wav|||We are on the path of change.|
035910|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_031.wav|||The problem in Norway is outside the National.|
034358|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_150.wav|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
036236|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_357.wav|||They might want to play.|
035788|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_333.wav|||Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.|
030009|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_366.wav|||But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|
036225|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_346.wav|||She is very upset.|
031268|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
036537|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_237.wav|||There were two things going on at once.|
