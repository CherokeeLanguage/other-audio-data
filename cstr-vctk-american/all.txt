026173|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
026174|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
026175|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
026176|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
026177|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
026178|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
026179|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026180|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026181|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026182|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026183|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026184|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
026185|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
026186|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
026187|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
026188|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
026189|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
026190|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026191|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
026192|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026193|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
026194|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
026195|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
026196|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
026197|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_025.wav|||They were the better team on the night.|
026198|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_026.wav|||The show is sold out, like the others in the run.|
026199|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_027.wav|||It means we have to have some patience.|
026200|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_028.wav|||For the moment, our position remains the same.|
026201|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_029.wav|||I was pregnant and very worried.|
026202|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_030.wav|||He said she was mad.|
026203|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_031.wav|||They were impressive against France.|
026204|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_032.wav|||I am delighted at Murray's appointment.|
026205|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_033.wav|||The airport was even different.|
026206|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_034.wav|||Other people had looked at it.|
026207|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_035.wav|||A neighbour said the street was shocked.|
026208|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_036.wav|||Michael, he is running!|
026209|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_037.wav|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
026210|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_038.wav|||Their ambition is to go back.|
026211|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_039.wav|||He got the same story.|
026212|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_040.wav|||My view has now changed completely.|
026213|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_041.wav|||I've been dying for an hour.|
026214|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_042.wav|||It wasn't a flight of fancy.|
026215|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_043.wav|||We're playing away from home and that's it.|
026216|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_044.wav|||I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|
026217|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_045.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
026218|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_046.wav|||Who was the mystery MP?|
026219|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_047.wav|||This was no accident.|
026220|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_048.wav|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
026221|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_049.wav|||We've all done it!|
026222|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_050.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
026223|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_051.wav|||Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.|
026224|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_052.wav|||The course record was in his name.|
026225|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_053.wav|||But we welcome this document.|
026226|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_054.wav|||What is the point of jailing him?|
026227|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_055.wav|||We should not bring him into a dispute.|
026228|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_056.wav|||This is a possible way forward.|
026229|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_057.wav|||I am not here to get even.|
026230|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_058.wav|||Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|
026231|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_059.wav|||We are only human.|
026232|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_060.wav|||I went with the mood.|
026233|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_061.wav|||I think we'll just keep it.|
026234|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_062.wav|||Debate is not just talk.|
026235|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_063.wav|||How is he enjoying life as a senior?|
026236|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_064.wav|||It is all about having physical evidence.|
026237|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_065.wav|||People remember the Tories in office.|
026238|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_066.wav|||What kind of inclusion is that?|
026239|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_067.wav|||I fell in love with it right away.|
026240|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_068.wav|||Domestic abuse is related to power and control.|
026241|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_069.wav|||It makes for an interesting conference.|
026242|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_070.wav|||I don't have any answer for them.|
026243|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_071.wav|||It took about five or six hours.|
026244|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_072.wav|||I found the course inspiring.|
026245|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_073.wav|||Two things were clear from the new programme.|
026246|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_074.wav|||This is the real thing now.|
026247|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_075.wav|||Until they came to do it.|
026248|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_076.wav|||She now lives in London.|
026249|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_077.wav|||It will not be a long campaign.|
026250|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_078.wav|||Subs not used, McGraw.|
026251|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_079.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
026252|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_080.wav|||One policeman was killed.|
026253|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_081.wav|||They could not have done more for me.|
026254|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_082.wav|||It was like a vacuum.|
026255|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_083.wav|||That was enough for the committee.|
026256|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_084.wav|||It is a very genuine prospect.|
026257|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_085.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
026258|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_086.wav|||We have to focus on what is important.|
026259|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_087.wav|||They have to work so hard.|
026260|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_088.wav|||It's not very pretty, but it's effective.|
026261|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_089.wav|||Seven British members of the club are missing.|
026262|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_090.wav|||He had just returned from a run.|
026263|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_091.wav|||There's a strong involvement.|
026264|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_092.wav|||Now, though, he has an incentive.|
026265|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_093.wav|||But now it's back to golf.|
026266|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_094.wav|||It should be a condition of employment.|
026267|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_095.wav|||Was it a signal?|
026268|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_096.wav|||It may not even be possible.|
026269|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_097.wav|||In fact, they go hand in hand.|
026270|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_098.wav|||I gave him a way out, and he took it.|
026271|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_099.wav|||So is that it, then?|
026272|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_100.wav|||You should have let it write the cards.|
026273|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_101.wav|||It's annoying in a way.|
026274|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_102.wav|||It's too close to call.|
026275|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_103.wav|||It's a long process.|
026276|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_104.wav|||I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|
026277|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_105.wav|||Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|
026278|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_106.wav|||The other conditions were not specified.|
026279|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_107.wav|||I've never felt affection for Emu.|
026280|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_108.wav|||That's not part of the deal.|
026281|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_109.wav|||That was the context of his remarks.|
026282|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_110.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
026283|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_111.wav|||We have great confidence in Derek.|
026284|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_112.wav|||My ambition is to tell a good story.|
026285|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_113.wav|||I don't know the nature of the illness.|
026286|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_114.wav|||The industry will try to get round it.|
026287|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_115.wav|||Who will deliver more service to Scotland?|
026288|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_116.wav|||I want to make a vigorous defence.|
026289|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_117.wav|||And she got it.|
026290|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_118.wav|||We are the weakest link.|
026291|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_119.wav|||We have now no choice.|
026292|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_120.wav|||My father and mother are.|
026293|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_121.wav|||We don't know what happened after.|
026294|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_122.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
026295|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_123.wav|||He seems to be used to the attention.|
026296|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_124.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
026297|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_125.wav|||We have very real concerns about it.|
026298|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
026299|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_127.wav|||People will see this over time.|
026300|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_128.wav|||I can't speak for him.|
026301|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_129.wav|||They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|
026302|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_130.wav|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
026303|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_131.wav|||I can't see him reversing that.|
026304|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_132.wav|||I'm deeply sorry they did.|
026305|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_133.wav|||I can lead by example.|
026306|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_134.wav|||I have had a wonderful career.|
026307|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_135.wav|||It seemed to have direction.|
026308|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_136.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|
026309|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_137.wav|||It was different in the endurance events.|
026310|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_138.wav|||Above all, the approach is upbeat.|
026311|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_139.wav|||The objective was achieved.|
026312|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_140.wav|||It was a hugely popular decision.|
026313|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_141.wav|||He invented the language.|
026314|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_142.wav|||Where are they?|
026315|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_143.wav|||It's hard not to.|
026316|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_144.wav|||It is a question of life and death.|
026317|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_145.wav|||However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|
026318|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_146.wav|||You ask the question.|
026319|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_147.wav|||She was always a quality act.|
026320|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_148.wav|||We are all very proud of her.|
026321|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_149.wav|||I'm sure that is not.|
026322|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_150.wav|||It's a great idea.|
026323|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_151.wav|||It's like a score in some ways.|
026324|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_152.wav|||It's a wonderful piece of water.|
026325|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_153.wav|||Feel the air, the space.|
026326|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_154.wav|||Therein lies the problem.|
026327|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_155.wav|||You feel the pride.|
026328|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_156.wav|||We are well insured.|
026329|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_157.wav|||I was quietly confident about getting the win.|
026330|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_158.wav|||The Treasury denied the claims.|
026331|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_159.wav|||You've been working for four years.|
026332|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_160.wav|||I am the Son of Sam.|
026333|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_161.wav|||There is no shortage of commitment.|
026334|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_162.wav|||Such as it is.|
026335|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_163.wav|||He deserves a second chance.|
026336|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_164.wav|||He also admitted.|
026337|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_165.wav|||There was no change in the strategy.|
026338|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_166.wav|||There's been a mistake.|
026339|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_167.wav|||It had until tomorrow to comply.|
026340|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_168.wav|||Genetic assessment is crucial.|
026341|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_169.wav|||I enjoy my work.|
026342|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_170.wav|||We have managed to get it under control.|
026343|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_171.wav|||We have a genuine budget in place.|
026344|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_172.wav|||Art is still a risky investment.|
026345|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_173.wav|||It was little else.|
026346|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_174.wav|||These things can happen.|
026347|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_175.wav|||Family members are at her bedside.|
026348|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_176.wav|||You have to go to the edges.|
026349|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_177.wav|||I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.|
026350|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_178.wav|||Harry will be up for it.|
026351|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_179.wav|||He could tell you.|
026352|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_180.wav|||My place is in the kitchen.|
026353|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_181.wav|||He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.|
026354|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_182.wav|||A decision is expected in September.|
026355|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_183.wav|||It was a big departure.|
026356|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_184.wav|||That's the name of the game, though.|
026357|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_185.wav|||It's a huge amount.|
026358|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_186.wav|||The fire was falling from the sky.|
026359|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_187.wav|||I want my mum.|
026360|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_188.wav|||This is simply unjust.|
026361|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_189.wav|||The First Minister is an addict.|
026362|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_190.wav|||Its role is not to interfere.|
026363|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_191.wav|||It is becoming a bit of a habit.|
026364|en-294-f|en|wav/p294_192.wav|||You can't believe a word.|

027019|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
027020|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

027390|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_385.wav|||One might think that is a power.|

027422|en-297-f|en|wav/p297_417.wav|||This is his personal life.|

027839|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
027840|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
027841|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
027842|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
027843|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
027844|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
027845|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
027846|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
027847|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
027848|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
027849|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
027850|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
027851|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
027852|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
027853|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
027854|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
027855|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
027856|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
027857|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
027858|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
027859|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_025.wav|||I just went for it over the weekend.|
027860|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_026.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|

027864|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_030.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
027865|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_031.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
027866|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_032.wav|||It's easy to see why.|
027867|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_033.wav|||I am proud of moments like that.|
027868|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_034.wav|||This is a totally different order of agreement.|
027869|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_035.wav|||Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|
027870|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_036.wav|||He was arrested, but later released without charge.|
027871|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_037.wav|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
027872|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_038.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
027873|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_039.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
027874|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_040.wav|||We agreed to disagree.|
027875|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_041.wav|||If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|
027876|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_042.wav|||If you look at the beginning of Alien.|
027877|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_043.wav|||I've learned from my mistakes.|
027878|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_044.wav|||Today is not about contracts.|
027879|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_045.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
027880|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_046.wav|||That says something for his strength of character.|
027881|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_047.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
027882|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_048.wav|||It's to do with play.|
027883|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_049.wav|||Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|
027884|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_050.wav|||I've just got to do this.|
027885|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_051.wav|||Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.|
027886|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_052.wav|||That was the problem.|
027887|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_053.wav|||Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|
027888|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_054.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
027889|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_055.wav|||Everything else is second.|
027890|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_056.wav|||I think it is a sensible change.|
027891|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_057.wav|||Sex is fun?|
027892|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_058.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
027893|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_059.wav|||He added, It's not a racial problem.|
027894|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_060.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|

027904|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_070.wav|||They had had time for little else.|
027905|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_071.wav|||Both of those promises have already been honoured.|
027906|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_072.wav|||We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|
027907|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_073.wav|||It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|

027925|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_091.wav|||There is a growing anger among the group.|
027926|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_092.wav|||We certainly will need to watch him.|
027927|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_093.wav|||I don't think it could be clearer.|
027928|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_094.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|

027941|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_107.wav|||I am a wealthy person.|
027942|en-299-f|en|wav/p299_108.wav|||He has one son and one daughter.|

028657|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
028658|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

028660|en-301-f|en|wav/p301_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

031332|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
031333|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_008.wav|||They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

031343|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

031345|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031346|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

031348|en-308-f|en|wav/p308_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

031756|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
031757|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
031758|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
031759|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
031760|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
031761|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|
031762|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
031763|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
031764|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.|
031765|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
031766|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
031767|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
031768|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031769|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031770|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
031771|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
031772|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

031776|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_028.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
031777|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_029.wav|||Did you see that?|
031778|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_030.wav|||The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|
031779|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_031.wav|||And the winners are.|
031780|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_032.wav|||I can't believe something like this could happen.|
031781|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_033.wav|||Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|
031782|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_034.wav|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|
031783|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_035.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
031784|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_036.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
031785|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_037.wav|||It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|
031786|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_038.wav|||We're still talking with a few people.|
031787|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_039.wav|||But one shouldn't go by that.|
031788|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_040.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
031789|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_041.wav|||Buying our way out is not an option.|
031790|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_042.wav|||There are big names.|
031791|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_043.wav|||That argument has been won.|
031792|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_044.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
031793|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_045.wav|||He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|
031794|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_046.wav|||And who would argue with that?|
031795|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_047.wav|||I hope you will leave it at that.|

031797|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_049.wav|||They had four children together.|
031798|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_050.wav|||Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.|

031800|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_052.wav|||I fell to the ground.|

031803|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_055.wav|||Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.|
031804|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_056.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
031805|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_057.wav|||All of us know it exists.|

031812|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_064.wav|||We shall not do that.|
031813|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_065.wav|||I have had no social life at all.|
031814|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_066.wav|||Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|

031829|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_081.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
031830|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_082.wav|||They don't work anymore anyway.|
031831|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_083.wav|||I wish they, too, would get a grip.|
031832|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_084.wav|||I am so sorry.|
031833|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_085.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|

031836|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_088.wav|||However, it is no longer with the national team.|
031837|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_089.wav|||She may even appear in some more films.|
031838|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_090.wav|||This is the best moment of my career.|
031839|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_091.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
031840|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_092.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
031841|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_093.wav|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
031842|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_094.wav|||I agree with them.|
031843|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_095.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|

031852|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_104.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
031853|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_105.wav|||His treatment has been quite atrocious.|
031854|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_106.wav|||It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|
031855|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_107.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
031856|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_108.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
031857|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_109.wav|||Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|

031862|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_114.wav|||Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|
031863|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_115.wav|||There is no guarantee.|
031864|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_116.wav|||I'm confident we can turn things around.|
031865|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_117.wav|||We want to get to the final, anyway.|
031866|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_118.wav|||It may be argued.|
031867|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_119.wav|||He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|
031868|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_120.wav|||I bought a car at auction.|
031869|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_121.wav|||And who were they anyway, beforehand?|
031870|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_122.wav|||His three-year appointment begins on Monday.|
031871|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_123.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
031872|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_124.wav|||Five in a month isn't good enough.|
031873|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_125.wav|||Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|
031874|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_126.wav|||This is just one example.|
031875|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_127.wav|||Both offices were closed yesterday.|
031876|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_128.wav|||They don't have to, but they normally do.|
031877|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_129.wav|||We stopped at half-time.|
031878|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_130.wav|||Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|
031879|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_131.wav|||David was not either.|

031887|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_139.wav|||The starting point is pretty unusual.|
031888|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_140.wav|||However, they will only be found in the wild.|
031889|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_141.wav|||They receive a high profile in the media.|
031890|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_142.wav|||It was an ambush.|
031891|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_143.wav|||I think this proposal is excellent.|
031892|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_144.wav|||If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|
031893|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_145.wav|||Is that too much to ask?|
031894|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_146.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|
031895|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_147.wav|||I've so much respect for him.|
031896|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_148.wav|||Each one has its own system.|

031899|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_151.wav|||And that was the adults.|
031900|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_152.wav|||Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|
031901|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_153.wav|||This is a job for the Government.|
031902|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_154.wav|||I felt the head was very like me.|
031903|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_155.wav|||We started with that.|
031904|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_156.wav|||And he had much need.|
031905|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_157.wav|||Last night the bombardment was terrible.|
031906|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_158.wav|||This can only help us go forward.|
031907|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_159.wav|||It's never the same problem.|
031908|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_160.wav|||But, even so, you always want to try something new.|
031909|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_161.wav|||Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.|
031910|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_162.wav|||I hadn't been looking after myself.|
031911|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_163.wav|||I was over the moon.|
031912|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_164.wav|||And really, the songs are the key thing.|
031913|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_165.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031914|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_166.wav|||His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|
031915|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_167.wav|||Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.|
031916|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_168.wav|||And then came the seventies.|
031917|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_169.wav|||I guess it is down to focus.|
031918|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_170.wav|||Last week, he was taken to the hospital.|
031919|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_171.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
031920|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_172.wav|||His track record is not promising.|
031921|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_173.wav|||No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|
031922|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_174.wav|||He put a lot of effort into it.|
031923|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_175.wav|||However, you have just got to adjust it.|
031924|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_176.wav|||That was moving the goalposts.|
031925|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_177.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
031926|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_178.wav|||We have the location, which is assured.|
031927|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_179.wav|||The club are feeling no different today.|
031928|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_180.wav|||What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|
031929|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_181.wav|||I see the extended family once a year.|
031930|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_182.wav|||I'm not a magician.|

031934|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_187.wav|||This guy is never going to give up.|
031935|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_188.wav|||They had previously been on five-day notice.|
031936|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_189.wav|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|
031937|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_190.wav|||The show is small but perfectly formed.|
031938|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_191.wav|||This is the first job of the director - leadership.|
031939|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_192.wav|||It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|
031940|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_193.wav|||It is too early to speculate.|
031941|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_194.wav|||I just had so much fun.|
031942|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_195.wav|||Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|
031943|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_196.wav|||I will wait until later.|
031944|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_197.wav|||Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|
031945|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_198.wav|||She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|
031946|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_199.wav|||Or so we have long assumed.|
031947|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_200.wav|||They responded with victories.|
031948|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_201.wav|||That was the personal impulse.|
031949|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_202.wav|||I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|
031950|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_203.wav|||But first it goes out on TV.|
031951|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_204.wav|||What is the truth about the cow?|
031952|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_205.wav|||They will want to watch a winning team.|
031953|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_206.wav|||I think it's awful.|
031954|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_207.wav|||Who is going to be penalised?|
031955|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_208.wav|||This will be just another tax on motorists.|
031956|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_209.wav|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
031957|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_210.wav|||One must hope not!|
031958|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_211.wav|||He is a Satan.|
031959|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_212.wav|||Just see where the blood is coming from.|
031960|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_213.wav|||He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|
031961|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_214.wav|||In her opinion, the rich are different.|
031962|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_215.wav|||Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|
031963|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_216.wav|||I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|
031964|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_217.wav|||There was no cohesion.|
031965|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_218.wav|||He was jailed for five years.|
031966|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_219.wav|||Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|
031967|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_220.wav|||We will not break even.|
031968|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_221.wav|||We will look into it.|
031969|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_222.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
031970|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_223.wav|||But he's not afraid to take risks.|
031971|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_224.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
031972|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_225.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
031973|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_226.wav|||However, it very nearly went wrong.|
031974|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_227.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
031975|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_228.wav|||Things are moving together.|
031976|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_229.wav|||I get to work with very good people.|
031977|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_230.wav|||A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|
031978|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_231.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
031979|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_232.wav|||Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|
031980|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_233.wav|||Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|
031981|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_234.wav|||Look at the table.|
031982|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_235.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
031983|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_236.wav|||I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|
031984|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_237.wav|||Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|
031985|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_238.wav|||Last year was not a good year.|
031986|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_239.wav|||It's a difficult job.|
031987|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_240.wav|||We can't get over it.|
031988|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_241.wav|||Several hundred people attended yesterday.|
031989|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_242.wav|||My preference is for the single vaccines.|
031990|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_243.wav|||This represents a tough game for us.|
031991|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_244.wav|||He saw it all as a big game.|
031992|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_245.wav|||They are not an item.|
031993|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_246.wav|||And thought we would get away with it.|
031994|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_247.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
031995|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_248.wav|||It's more like a Labour Party rally.|
031996|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_249.wav|||Staff should be paid for what they produce.|
031997|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_250.wav|||I would urge the Government to think again.|
031998|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_251.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
031999|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_252.wav|||They were on holiday in Egypt.|
032000|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_253.wav|||I was happiest with my short game.|
032001|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_254.wav|||We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|
032002|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_255.wav|||We went on to become very successful.|
032003|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_256.wav|||Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.|
032004|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_257.wav|||No, is the answer to your first question.|
032005|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_258.wav|||We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|
032006|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_259.wav|||That could be at least five years away.|
032007|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_260.wav|||That is my role.|
032008|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_261.wav|||He also presented You Bet!|
032009|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_262.wav|||That's the day job.|
032010|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_263.wav|||It really is taken seriously.|
032011|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_264.wav|||We have not given up hope.|
032012|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_265.wav|||I'm looking at ways to do that now.|
032013|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_266.wav|||Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|
032014|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_267.wav|||It's such a trial!|
032015|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_268.wav|||That kind of growth is the important thing.|
032016|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_269.wav|||I think it is totally wrong.|
032017|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_270.wav|||And a film maker was born.|
032018|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_271.wav|||It was also put on the Internet.|
032019|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_272.wav|||The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.|
032020|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_273.wav|||And yet his legacy is doubtful.|
032021|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_274.wav|||It seems to have worked.|
032022|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_275.wav|||Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|
032023|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_276.wav|||There was a battle there.|
032024|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_277.wav|||This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|
032025|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_278.wav|||Well, when did he ever refuse?|
032026|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_279.wav|||Today's ruling confirms that.|
032027|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_280.wav|||It's good news and long overdue.|
032028|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_281.wav|||THE atmosphere was electric.|
032029|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_282.wav|||I'd never heard him in person before.|
032030|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_283.wav|||We're going to change our party.|
032031|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_284.wav|||Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|
032032|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_285.wav|||I have learned a lot from him.|
032033|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_286.wav|||Is he any good in the kitchen?|
032034|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_287.wav|||He has been campaigning for change for years.|
032035|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_288.wav|||A formal decision will be announced within months.|
032036|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_289.wav|||He must have something up his sleeve.|
032037|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_290.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
032038|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_291.wav|||We make good weapons.|
032039|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_292.wav|||So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|
032040|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_293.wav|||This is not a Scottish problem.|
032041|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_294.wav|||Then followed a bout of flu.|
032042|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_295.wav|||The balance isn't there at EMI.|
032043|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_296.wav|||That was the most annoying thing.|
032044|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_297.wav|||We are being hijacked.|
032045|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_298.wav|||We had no part in it.|
032046|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_299.wav|||It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.|
032047|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_300.wav|||Mike Tyson went to prison.|
032048|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_301.wav|||It was nice to get a clean sheet.|
032049|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_302.wav|||Our young people are leaving.|
032050|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_303.wav|||And there is no cause for it.|
032051|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_304.wav|||That would have been too easy.|
032052|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_305.wav|||She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|
032053|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_306.wav|||This is not a faceless system.|
032054|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_307.wav|||This is a long-term discussion paper.|
032055|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_308.wav|||In all cases computer equipment was seized.|
032056|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_309.wav|||It is just like the stock market.|
032057|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_310.wav|||The damage from the fire was huge.|
032058|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
032059|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_312.wav|||Both agreed on the success of the event.|
032060|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_313.wav|||What, then, is the real thing?|
032061|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_314.wav|||Boarding school was equally protective.|
032062|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_315.wav|||Most people know that.|
032063|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_316.wav|||It will be the final push.|
032064|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_317.wav|||Clearly, this was the important nursing.|
032065|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_318.wav|||Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|
032066|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_319.wav|||The campaign was raucous.|
032067|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_320.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
032068|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_321.wav|||But both were involved with other matters.|
032069|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_322.wav|||But we were wrong.|
032070|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_323.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
032071|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_324.wav|||However, in October another partnership was announced.|
032072|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_325.wav|||There is no threat to them.|
032073|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_326.wav|||Nelson does not disappoint.|
032074|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_327.wav|||The goal will stay with me forever.|
032075|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_328.wav|||The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|
032076|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_329.wav|||Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|
032077|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_330.wav|||It is a high time to act.|
032078|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_331.wav|||Then we will face the Danish champions.|
032079|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_332.wav|||He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|
032080|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_333.wav|||The South African defended his work ethic.|
032081|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_334.wav|||We have a team to reach the final.|
032082|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_335.wav|||There was barely a handful of chances.|
032083|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_336.wav|||The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.|
032084|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_337.wav|||I have found my vision.|
032085|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_338.wav|||We don't know the scale of need.|
032086|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_339.wav|||You need a reason for staying.|
032087|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_340.wav|||Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.|
032088|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_341.wav|||However, we have not come to any conclusions.|
032089|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_342.wav|||I don't expect to see that this time.|
032090|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_343.wav|||You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|
032091|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_344.wav|||The big issue for us is the review.|
032092|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_345.wav|||That is not the way we should operate.|
032093|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_346.wav|||More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.|
032094|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_347.wav|||The new work will begin in the autumn.|
032095|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_348.wav|||The written judgment was issued in printed form.|
032096|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_349.wav|||He showed he has some things to learn.|
032097|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_350.wav|||Or do they?|
032098|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_351.wav|||They are the innocent victims.|
032099|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_352.wav|||It is now time for justice.|
032100|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_353.wav|||That is of no use.|
032101|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_354.wav|||I could have been offended.|
032102|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_355.wav|||Now it is measuring it in dollars.|
032103|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_356.wav|||But he is frustrated at every turn.|
032104|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_357.wav|||He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.|
032105|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_358.wav|||This is the lowest of the low.|
032106|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_359.wav|||Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|
032107|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_360.wav|||Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|
032108|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_361.wav|||He's a nice guy.|
032109|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_362.wav|||The milk industry is in turmoil.|
032110|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_363.wav|||I love the moment of being first.|
032111|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_364.wav|||It is a decision which has paid off.|
032112|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_365.wav|||Their mind was already made up.|
032113|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_366.wav|||I had some time with Aston Villa.|
032114|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_367.wav|||But it's got to be worth it.|
032115|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_368.wav|||But does the same thing happen with music?|
032116|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_369.wav|||I just couldn't believe what had happened.|
032117|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_370.wav|||Alex is a big part of that future.|
032118|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_371.wav|||Pray that is so.|
032119|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_372.wav|||In fact it isn't related to either.|
032120|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_373.wav|||There was support from across the board.|
032121|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_374.wav|||There may be some evidence to this effect.|
032122|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_375.wav|||It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|
032123|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_376.wav|||So what does one do?|
032124|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_377.wav|||Such actions are rarely popular.|
032125|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_378.wav|||The methadone programme is completely out of control.|
032126|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_379.wav|||That is why it's so lyrical.|
032127|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_380.wav|||I joined a group.|
032128|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_381.wav|||I've heard this stuff about the markets.|
032129|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_382.wav|||It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|
032130|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_383.wav|||It has removed a bit of guilt.|
032131|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_384.wav|||And they all had these other commitments.|
032132|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_385.wav|||However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|
032133|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_386.wav|||Here, again, they were denied a voice.|
032134|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_387.wav|||They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.|
032135|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_388.wav|||Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|
032136|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_389.wav|||I never agreed with that.|
032137|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_390.wav|||I didn't actually believe them at first.|

032149|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_402.wav|||I'm happy to contribute to that.|
032150|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_403.wav|||Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|
032151|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_404.wav|||We were close, but not close enough.|
032152|en-310-f|en|wav/p310_405.wav|||And that started me thinking.|

032178|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032179|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032180|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032181|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032182|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
032183|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032184|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

032188|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032189|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032190|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032191|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
032192|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
032193|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032194|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

032285|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_114.wav|||It is nearly there.|
032286|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_115.wav|||Otherwise we will pay the price.|
032287|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_116.wav|||I find it rather oppressive.|

032299|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_128.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
032300|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_129.wav|||The hearing was continued until a later date.|
032301|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_130.wav|||Still, some additions are inspired.|
032302|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_131.wav|||Planning is a key issue.|

032330|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_159.wav|||The party will make up its own mind.|
032331|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_160.wav|||At least two women were among those arrested.|
032332|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_161.wav|||They never got into the show this time.|
032333|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_162.wav|||But no, it's not funny.|
032334|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_163.wav|||In that case, the children were not missing.|
032335|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_164.wav|||He changed my life.|
032336|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_165.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
032337|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_166.wav|||Two options are being proposed.|
032338|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_167.wav|||They haven't been thought through.|
032339|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_168.wav|||The criteria have changed.|
032340|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_169.wav|||O, Is there a lot of blood?|
032341|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_170.wav|||Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|
032342|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_171.wav|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
032343|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_172.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
032344|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_173.wav|||This is a very interesting move.|
032345|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_174.wav|||The highest rate is in Glasgow.|
032346|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_175.wav|||His only reply was a laugh.|
032347|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_176.wav|||those who are preparing to give up.|
032348|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_177.wav|||What kind of festival is proposed?|
032349|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_178.wav|||I was delighted with every one of them.|
032350|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_179.wav|||Sure the COE is a cracking band.|
032351|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_180.wav|||Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|
032352|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_181.wav|||That will help my case a bit.|
032353|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_182.wav|||It was entirely justified.|
032354|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_183.wav|||He looked at me before replying.|
032355|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_184.wav|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
032356|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_185.wav|||It feels that the game is off.|
032357|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_186.wav|||There will be no change in government.|
032358|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_187.wav|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
032359|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_188.wav|||But we still don't know.|
032360|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_189.wav|||Who do you think you are?|
032361|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_190.wav|||Glasgow is a tour de force.|
032362|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_191.wav|||I have no battle with the Scots.|
032363|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_192.wav|||It is all credit to them today.|
032364|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_193.wav|||I have done ever since it was published.|
032365|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_194.wav|||Nobody could survive on that.|
032366|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_195.wav|||They seem to turn up for them.|
032367|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_196.wav|||They were kept there for a summer.|
032368|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_197.wav|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
032369|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_198.wav|||It is that sort of film.|
032370|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_199.wav|||She was not hard done by.|
032371|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_200.wav|||Can you believe it?|
032372|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_201.wav|||I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|
032373|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_202.wav|||They are now out in the cold.|
032374|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_203.wav|||However, planners should be taking the lead.|
032375|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_204.wav|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
032376|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_205.wav|||Our message was inclusive.|
032377|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_206.wav|||This has been a shock.|
032378|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_207.wav|||Yet the survey has been cautious.|
032379|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_208.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
032380|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_209.wav|||There has also been some Scots input.|
032381|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_210.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
032382|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_211.wav|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
032383|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_212.wav|||But who will buy it?|
032384|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_213.wav|||It had to be more flexible.|
032385|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_214.wav|||Openness is always the best way.|
032386|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_215.wav|||It wouldn't go off.|
032387|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_216.wav|||It can be halted.|
032388|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_217.wav|||This was a lot of numbers.|
032389|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_218.wav|||Would it be good for the Nationwide League?|
032390|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_219.wav|||Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|
032391|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_220.wav|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
032392|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_221.wav|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
032393|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_222.wav|||The professor said the results were positive.|
032394|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_223.wav|||I think he's the favourite, no question.|
032395|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_224.wav|||But it's just great to have won.|
032396|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_225.wav|||And it paid off.|
032397|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_226.wav|||Gone with them is any sense of narrative.|
032398|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_227.wav|||Those Were The Days, indeed.|
032399|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_228.wav|||I never made any offer to Mark.|
032400|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_229.wav|||It should be scrapped.|
032401|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_230.wav|||He admitted the asylum system was not working.|
032402|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_231.wav|||They are just trying to cover up.|
032403|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_232.wav|||We have to defend ourselves.|
032404|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_233.wav|||I came here this week to work.|
032405|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_234.wav|||Where do we go from here?|
032406|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_235.wav|||Barry Ferguson is one of them.|
032407|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_236.wav|||He gets his moment.|
032408|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_237.wav|||This was an option from the beginning.|
032409|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_238.wav|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
032410|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_239.wav|||It's not a party, no, no.|
032411|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_240.wav|||It's not that clear-cut.|
032412|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_241.wav|||It may not be life long.|
032413|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_242.wav|||It was just above the roof.|
032414|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_243.wav|||It has changed, and not for the better.|
032415|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_244.wav|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
032416|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_245.wav|||Everyone must be focused on the league.|
032417|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_246.wav|||The English are coming.|
032418|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_247.wav|||I believe in theatre.|
032419|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_248.wav|||Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|
032420|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_249.wav|||However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|
032421|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_250.wav|||It's time to say enough is enough.|
032422|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_251.wav|||Mentally, you have to be tough.|
032423|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_252.wav|||He has to pull back from the brink.|
032424|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_253.wav|||She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|
032425|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_254.wav|||That's my daughter acting.|
032426|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_255.wav|||The film has also been superbly designed.|
032427|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_256.wav|||The performance was really, really immense.|
032428|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_257.wav|||Faces from the Eighties.|
032429|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_258.wav|||The family baton is handed on.|
032430|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_259.wav|||How can this be?|
032431|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_260.wav|||We are still alive and kicking.|
032432|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_261.wav|||I want to go now.|
032433|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_262.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
032434|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_263.wav|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
032435|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_264.wav|||All the children on the roll are genuine.|
032436|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_265.wav|||They said we were out of touch.|
032437|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_266.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
032438|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_267.wav|||There is no signature.|
032439|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_268.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
032440|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_269.wav|||The kids are paying the price.|
032441|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_270.wav|||He said he was delighted by the award.|
032442|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_271.wav|||They didn't find any substance.|
032443|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_272.wav|||They still have the dirty work to do.|
032444|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_273.wav|||I've never seen a game like it.|
032445|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_274.wav|||It doesn't seem like that long ago.|
032446|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_275.wav|||He will do very well.|
032447|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_276.wav|||They also intend to travel today.|
032448|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_277.wav|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
032449|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_278.wav|||The casualties were not named.|
032450|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_279.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
032451|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_280.wav|||There are two ways to start a festival.|
032452|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_281.wav|||I am very happy with life.|
032453|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_282.wav|||Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|
032454|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_283.wav|||My office is down there.|
032455|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_284.wav|||Even then this game was not over.|
032456|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_285.wav|||Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.|
032457|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_286.wav|||We also hope to meet the men.|
032458|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_287.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
032459|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_288.wav|||It has become very confused.|
032460|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_289.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
032461|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_290.wav|||I am not in denial.|
032462|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_291.wav|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
032463|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_292.wav|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
032464|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_293.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
032465|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
032466|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_295.wav|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
032467|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_296.wav|||Then there's the Old Firm.|
032468|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_297.wav|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
032469|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_298.wav|||We were in different places, usually in cellars.|
032470|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_299.wav|||They're not always the same person.|
032471|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_300.wav|||It would have to be backdated.|
032472|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_301.wav|||He said he was sorry.|
032473|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_302.wav|||My position on the euro is quite clear.|
032474|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_303.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
032475|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_304.wav|||We have worked well with them for years.|
032476|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_305.wav|||That was me today.|
032477|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_306.wav|||That is the consistent approach of the Government.|
032478|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_307.wav|||That is when we are really effective.|
032479|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_308.wav|||The director's a genius.|
032480|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_309.wav|||There was no sign that anything was amiss.|
032481|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_310.wav|||It was the climax of the thing.|
032482|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_311.wav|||This is new money.|
032483|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_312.wav|||We have not given up on the game.|
032484|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_313.wav|||The decision was left entirely to him.|
032485|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_314.wav|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
032486|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_315.wav|||Nobody should believe this story.|
032487|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_316.wav|||This is not out of choice.|
032488|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_317.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
032489|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_318.wav|||But this one has a lot of potential.|
032490|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_319.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
032491|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_320.wav|||We'll see what happens.|
032492|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_321.wav|||This was another video cassette.|
032493|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_322.wav|||If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|
032494|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_323.wav|||It will make a huge difference.|
032495|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_324.wav|||He pretended not to care.|
032496|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_325.wav|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
032497|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_326.wav|||I was in tears in the street.|
032498|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_327.wav|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
032499|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_328.wav|||No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.|
032500|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_329.wav|||But that's not the idea behind this article.|
032501|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_330.wav|||If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|
032502|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_331.wav|||That is why we are here.|
032503|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_332.wav|||The German had a point to make.|
032504|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_333.wav|||This time, however, may have been different.|
032505|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_334.wav|||You have to feel for the guy.|
032506|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_335.wav|||However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|
032507|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_336.wav|||Bomber was not amused.|
032508|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_337.wav|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
032509|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_338.wav|||Was it just negligent.|
032510|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_339.wav|||And suddenly it became a free-for-all.|
032511|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_340.wav|||This Government is cutting taxes.|
032512|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_341.wav|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
032513|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_342.wav|||This is a big club.|
032514|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_343.wav|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
032515|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_344.wav|||They will now get that support.|
032516|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_345.wav|||I feel it's time to make the switch.|
032517|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_346.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
032518|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_347.wav|||I've no problem with what they said.|
032519|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_348.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
032520|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_349.wav|||I think we have got the balance right.|
032521|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_350.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
032522|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_351.wav|||It is physical but it is also good.|
032523|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_352.wav|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
032524|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_353.wav|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|
032525|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_354.wav|||So it goes on.|
032526|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_355.wav|||We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|
032527|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_356.wav|||I hope they will understand the reasons.|
032528|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_357.wav|||They should have listened to me.|
032529|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_358.wav|||I am greatly encouraged.|
032530|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_359.wav|||It was like someone had died.|
032531|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_360.wav|||What does he want him to look like?|
032532|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_361.wav|||The actors are confident and polished.|
032533|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_362.wav|||I hope he would have been very pleased.|
032534|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_363.wav|||We would have concerns about that.|
032535|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_364.wav|||Taxes may need to rise.|
032536|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_365.wav|||It's unusual to say the least.|
032537|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_366.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
032538|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_367.wav|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|
032539|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_368.wav|||I just did not cope with the pressure.|
032540|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_369.wav|||We have some concerns.|
032541|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_370.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
032542|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_371.wav|||This was a chilling echo.|
032543|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_372.wav|||They really want to do it.|
032544|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_373.wav|||And then he laughs.|
032545|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_374.wav|||I recommend a tour.|
032546|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_375.wav|||We don't ask for much.|
032547|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_376.wav|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
032548|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_377.wav|||I had a wonderful time working with him.|
032549|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_378.wav|||We have to start again on Saturday.|
032550|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_379.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
032551|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_380.wav|||And it covers the spectrum.|
032552|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_381.wav|||The replacements made a big difference.|
032553|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_382.wav|||And the winners are.|
032554|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_383.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
032555|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_384.wav|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|
032556|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_385.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
032557|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_386.wav|||There are big names.|
032558|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_387.wav|||My players are precious to me.|
032559|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_388.wav|||That argument has been won.|
032560|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_389.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
032561|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_390.wav|||For us, that decision was hard to understand.|
032562|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_391.wav|||I had to calm down.|
032563|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_392.wav|||Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|
032564|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_393.wav|||She returned home a few days later.|
032565|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_394.wav|||They haven't run away.|
032566|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_395.wav|||Nobody can take it away from me.|
032567|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_396.wav|||She is fulfilled by it.|
032568|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_397.wav|||He said no survivors had been found.|
032569|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_398.wav|||Who can say?|
032570|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_399.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
032571|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_400.wav|||In short, the club was broke.|
032572|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_401.wav|||Sadly, in this case, that was not so.|
032573|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_402.wav|||She is a veteran in the Balkans.|
032574|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_403.wav|||The men are safe and unharmed.|
032575|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_404.wav|||We're not the tourist board.|
032576|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_405.wav|||It was the same old story.|
032577|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_406.wav|||I was frustrated here.|
032578|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_407.wav|||We have reacted well to each other.|
032579|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_408.wav|||Are you watching Liverpool?|
032580|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_409.wav|||I was furious about it.|
032581|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_410.wav|||This will be no easy option.|
032582|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_411.wav|||They knew they shouldn't have been there.|
032583|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_412.wav|||Of course we aren't.|
032584|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_413.wav|||We haven't been told.|
032585|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_414.wav|||It worked well in Monaco.|
032586|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_415.wav|||They were outside the circle.|
032587|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_416.wav|||The whole process was so different.|
032588|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_417.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
032589|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_418.wav|||I agree with them.|
032590|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_419.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
032591|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_420.wav|||We will listen to colleagues.|
032592|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_421.wav|||It's very difficult and very worrying.|
032593|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_422.wav|||It's something we want to make work.|
032594|en-311-m|en|wav/p311_423.wav|||There will be no excuses on Wednesday.|
034700|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
034701|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
034702|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
034703|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034704|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034705|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034706|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034707|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034708|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034709|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034710|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034711|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034712|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034713|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
034714|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034715|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034716|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034717|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034718|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034719|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034720|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
034721|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034722|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_025.wav|||They will be dealt with.|
034723|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_026.wav|||It is never an easy game.|
034724|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_027.wav|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
034725|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_028.wav|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
034726|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_029.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
034727|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_030.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
034728|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_031.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
034729|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_032.wav|||It was important to win the singles.|
034730|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_033.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
034731|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_034.wav|||That is impressive by any standards.|
034732|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_035.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
034733|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
034734|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_037.wav|||This was the performance, and the result they needed.|
034735|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_038.wav|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
034736|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_039.wav|||It helped to get me noticed.|
034737|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_040.wav|||They hit me in the head.|
034738|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_041.wav|||But he is not using them.|
034739|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_042.wav|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
034740|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_043.wav|||We are not moving in.|
034741|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_044.wav|||We have not had a formal request.|
034742|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_045.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
034743|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_046.wav|||Its effect on humans is not yet known.|
034744|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_047.wav|||We offered something different.|
034745|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_048.wav|||We were very much a happy family.|
034746|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_049.wav|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
034747|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_050.wav|||My brother is buried under there.|
034748|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_051.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
034749|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_052.wav|||What were they?|
034750|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_053.wav|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
034751|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_054.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
034752|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_055.wav|||Her role in it was small.|
034753|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_056.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
034754|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_057.wav|||We might be back next year.|
034755|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_058.wav|||In a way he was.|
034756|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_059.wav|||It's back to how it used to be.|
034757|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_060.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
034758|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_061.wav|||The firm was down and almost out.|
034759|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_062.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
034760|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_063.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
034761|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_064.wav|||I learned a lot from that.|
034762|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_065.wav|||The house was so well alight.|
034763|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_066.wav|||He got his degree.|
034764|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_067.wav|||Sandy was very active.|
034765|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
034766|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_069.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
034767|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_070.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
034768|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_071.wav|||There were no formal announcements.|
034769|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
034770|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_073.wav|||It really has left the town in shock.|
034771|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_074.wav|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
034772|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_075.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
034773|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_076.wav|||This was much worse.|
034774|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_077.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
034775|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_078.wav|||We are confident of taking that back.|
034776|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_079.wav|||They must be kept on the ground.|
034777|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_080.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
034778|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_081.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
034779|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_082.wav|||This does not help.|
034780|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_083.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
034781|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_084.wav|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
034782|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_085.wav|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
034783|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_086.wav|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
034784|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_087.wav|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
034785|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_088.wav|||This could be her way forward.|
034786|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_089.wav|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
034787|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_090.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
034788|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_091.wav|||It's a very, very special day.|
034789|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_092.wav|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
034790|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_093.wav|||There's also the point.|
034791|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_094.wav|||It was forced to divert.|
034792|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_095.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
034793|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_096.wav|||That's the National Grid.|
034794|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_097.wav|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
034795|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_098.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|
034796|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_099.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
034797|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_100.wav|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
034798|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_101.wav|||This is my personal assessment.|
034799|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_102.wav|||There was no trouble at all.|
034800|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_103.wav|||Although, you never know.|
034801|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_104.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
034802|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_105.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
034803|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_106.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
034804|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_107.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
034805|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_108.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
034806|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_109.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
034807|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_110.wav|||I took the gun.|
034808|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_111.wav|||It's just one of those things.|
034809|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_112.wav|||A web site is planned for November.|
034810|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_113.wav|||We played so well at times.|
034811|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_114.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
034812|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_115.wav|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
034813|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
034814|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_117.wav|||They will be destroyed.|
034815|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_118.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
034816|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_119.wav|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
034817|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_120.wav|||The Tory party will last.|
034818|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_121.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
034819|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_122.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
034820|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_123.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
034821|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_124.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
034822|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_125.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
034823|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_126.wav|||What's the point?|
034824|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_127.wav|||Why is this?|
034825|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_128.wav|||What has changed since then?|
034826|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_129.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
034827|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_130.wav|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
034828|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_131.wav|||I'd love to be at the World Cup.|
034829|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_132.wav|||He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|
034830|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_133.wav|||I am sorry to hear this news.|
034831|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_134.wav|||At some point, the bill will be presented.|
034832|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_135.wav|||I mean it happens.|
034833|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_136.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
034834|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_137.wav|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
034835|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_138.wav|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
034836|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_139.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
034837|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_140.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
034838|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_141.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
034839|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_142.wav|||It is typical of me.|
034840|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_143.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
034841|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_144.wav|||They played it like a cup final.|
034842|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_145.wav|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
034843|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_146.wav|||But the championship is not over yet.|
034844|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_147.wav|||We haven't found out anything different.|
034845|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_148.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
034846|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_149.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
034847|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_150.wav|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
034848|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_151.wav|||Surely it can do better than that?|
034849|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_152.wav|||I am ashamed of them.|
034850|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_153.wav|||Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|
034851|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_154.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
034852|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_155.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
034853|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_156.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
034854|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_157.wav|||I am not blaming audiences.|
034855|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_158.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
034856|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_159.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
034857|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_160.wav|||He had never run the distance before.|
034858|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_161.wav|||I can make one further announcement.|
034859|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_162.wav|||The General Election is all to play for.|
034860|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_163.wav|||It was a fiery game.|
034861|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_164.wav|||Agents and coaches must be paid.|
034862|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_165.wav|||Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|
034863|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_166.wav|||Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|
034864|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_167.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
034865|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_168.wav|||This one is a special case.|
034866|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_169.wav|||But what are the songs about?|
034867|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_170.wav|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
034868|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_171.wav|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
034869|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_172.wav|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
034870|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_173.wav|||The stadium was full.|
034871|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_174.wav|||Dewar is the medium.|
034872|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_175.wav|||It was that kind of night.|
034873|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_176.wav|||It is very much a matter for them.|
034874|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_177.wav|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
034875|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_178.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
034876|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_179.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
034877|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
034878|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_181.wav|||I hope we do.|
034879|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_182.wav|||From now on there is no hiding place.|
034880|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_183.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
034881|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_184.wav|||He quit in October.|
034882|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_185.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
034883|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_186.wav|||Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|
034884|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_187.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
034885|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_188.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
034886|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_189.wav|||They were that poor.|
034887|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_190.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
034888|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_191.wav|||We have understood the problems for some time.|
034889|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_192.wav|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
034890|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_193.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
034891|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_194.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
034892|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_195.wav|||They believed it worked.|
034893|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_196.wav|||After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|
034894|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_197.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
034895|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_198.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
034896|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_199.wav|||So they will settle again.|
034897|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_200.wav|||How do we get more people in?|
034898|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_201.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
034899|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_202.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
034900|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_203.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
034901|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_204.wav|||Election results are expected soon.|
034902|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_205.wav|||So she told him.|
034903|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_206.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
034904|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_207.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
034905|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_208.wav|||It was good to score the goal today.|
034906|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_209.wav|||The night is young.|
034907|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_210.wav|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
034908|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_211.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
034909|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_212.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
034910|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_213.wav|||The squad will be the same for France.|
034911|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_214.wav|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
034912|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_215.wav|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
034913|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_216.wav|||We are still paying the price for that.|
034914|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_217.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
034915|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_218.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
034916|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_219.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
034917|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_220.wav|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
034918|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_221.wav|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
034919|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_222.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
034920|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_223.wav|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
034921|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_224.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
034922|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_225.wav|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
034923|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_226.wav|||From our point of view, it is the right time.|
034924|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_227.wav|||That figure will always remain with me.|
034925|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_228.wav|||And then a funny thing happened.|
034926|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_229.wav|||It does not take much.|
034927|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_230.wav|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
034928|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_231.wav|||It was a stunning strike.|
034929|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_232.wav|||It is a technique.|
034930|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_233.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
034931|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_234.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
034932|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_235.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
034933|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_236.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
034934|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_237.wav|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
034935|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_238.wav|||There is nothing to fear.|
034936|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_239.wav|||I was an athlete.|
034937|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_240.wav|||Life was like a timetable.|
034938|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_241.wav|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
034939|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_242.wav|||I tried to push him away.|
034940|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_243.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
034941|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_244.wav|||This was done by the council staff.|
034942|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_245.wav|||The truth is otherwise.|
034943|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_246.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
034944|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_247.wav|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
034945|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_248.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
034946|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_249.wav|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
034947|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_250.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
034948|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_251.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
034949|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_252.wav|||The man became a reporter.|
034950|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_253.wav|||It is a memorial.|
034951|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_254.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
034952|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_255.wav|||Our people are paying high prices.|
034953|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_256.wav|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
034954|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_257.wav|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
034955|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_258.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
034956|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
034957|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_260.wav|||I read it every year.|
034958|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_261.wav|||He was in contention almost every week.|
034959|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_262.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
034960|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_263.wav|||It is up to Ann.|
034961|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_264.wav|||We are playing them at their own game.|
034962|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_265.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
034963|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_266.wav|||I had trouble with the producers.|
034964|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_267.wav|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
034965|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_268.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
034966|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_269.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
034967|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_270.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
034968|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_271.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|
034969|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_272.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
034970|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_273.wav|||There is no more money.|
034971|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_274.wav|||My mother is a widow.|
034972|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_275.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
034973|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_276.wav|||There have been different reports from different people.|
034974|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_277.wav|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
034975|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_278.wav|||Something was plainly wrong.|
034976|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_279.wav|||Why should he go anywhere?|
034977|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_280.wav|||One thing is sure.|
034978|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_281.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
034979|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_282.wav|||I'm confident we can do that.|
034980|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_283.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
034981|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_284.wav|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
034982|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_285.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
034983|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_286.wav|||We are talking about the outskirts of London.|
034984|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_287.wav|||The end result is precisely the same.|
034985|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
034986|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_289.wav|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
034987|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_290.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
034988|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_291.wav|||It's never over until it's over.|
034989|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_292.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
034990|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_293.wav|||This year, it was a little different.|
034991|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_294.wav|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
034992|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_295.wav|||We gave them the goal.|
034993|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_296.wav|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
034994|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_297.wav|||What's the point of staying sober?|
034995|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_298.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
034996|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_299.wav|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
034997|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_300.wav|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
034998|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_301.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
034999|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_302.wav|||I can feel the sound inside.|
035000|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_303.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
035001|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_304.wav|||I am not a fan of books.|
035002|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_305.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
035003|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_306.wav|||It may well have been.|
035004|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_307.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
035005|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_308.wav|||It was a simple question.|
035006|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_309.wav|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
035007|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_310.wav|||And we have beaten them before.|
035008|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_311.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
035009|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_312.wav|||I am not a paedophile.|
035010|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_313.wav|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
035011|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_314.wav|||But they had to be paid for.|
035012|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_315.wav|||The odds are that it will.|
035013|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_316.wav|||But then they scored their fourth.|
035014|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_317.wav|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
035015|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_318.wav|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
035016|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_319.wav|||Why is that?|
035017|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_320.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
035018|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_321.wav|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
035019|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_322.wav|||But will they fall in love?|
035020|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_323.wav|||As if they ever stopped.|
035021|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_324.wav|||The referee had a shocking game.|

035034|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_337.wav|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
035035|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_338.wav|||They've been wonderful to me.|
035036|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_339.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
035037|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_340.wav|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|

035039|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_342.wav|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
035040|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_343.wav|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
035041|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_344.wav|||It's a question of perception.|
035042|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_345.wav|||Staff have been informed.|
035043|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_346.wav|||My heart is not so sure.|
035044|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_347.wav|||This morning was very quiet.|
035045|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_348.wav|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
035046|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_349.wav|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
035047|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_350.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
035048|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_351.wav|||That might help a bit.|

035053|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_356.wav|||You have obviously got an answer to it.|
035054|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_357.wav|||It seems very odd.|
035055|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_358.wav|||Closure is not one of them.|
035056|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_359.wav|||The hotel was huge.|

035060|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_363.wav|||This is an internal matter.|
035061|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_364.wav|||I am amazed at what he's done.|
035062|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_365.wav|||They took a risk.|
035063|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_366.wav|||The idea was presented to me.|

035075|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_378.wav|||That's the only thing that matters.|
035076|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_379.wav|||I enjoy the creative process.|
035077|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_380.wav|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
035078|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_381.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
035079|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_382.wav|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
035080|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_383.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
035081|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_384.wav|||We have been preparing all year.|
035082|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_385.wav|||We could learn a lot from them.|
035083|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_386.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
035084|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_387.wav|||Sure, we have problems.|
035085|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_388.wav|||I was released after six days.|
035086|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_389.wav|||That time is not far away.|
035087|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_390.wav|||I may think about performing it.|
035088|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_391.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
035089|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_392.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
035090|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_393.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
035091|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_394.wav|||You can't go back and change things.|
035092|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_395.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
035093|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_396.wav|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
035094|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_397.wav|||Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|
035095|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_398.wav|||He says it often enough.|
035096|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_399.wav|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
035097|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_400.wav|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
035098|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_401.wav|||I found that much more challenging.|
035099|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_402.wav|||This fight is not going to go away.|
035100|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_403.wav|||It would have been very easily done.|
035101|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_404.wav|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
035102|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_405.wav|||The Open champion is back.|
035103|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_406.wav|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
035104|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_407.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
035105|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_408.wav|||I want to keep him.|
035106|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_409.wav|||He deserves a top team.|
035107|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_410.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
035108|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_411.wav|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
035109|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_412.wav|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
035110|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_413.wav|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
035111|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
035112|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_415.wav|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
035113|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_416.wav|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
035114|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_417.wav|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
035115|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_418.wav|||Would they work together again?|
035116|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_419.wav|||I didn't play all that well.|
035117|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_420.wav|||Who can tell?|
035118|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_421.wav|||It appears to have been closed down.|
035119|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
035120|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_423.wav|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
035121|en-318-f|en|wav/p318_424.wav|||We have no plans for direct action.|
035944|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
035945|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
035946|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
035947|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
035948|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
035949|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
035950|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035951|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
035952|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
035953|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
035954|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
035955|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
035956|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
035957|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
035958|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
035959|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
035960|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
035961|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
035962|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
035963|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
035964|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
035965|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
035966|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
035967|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
035968|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_025.wav|||But there has never been the time, she said.|
035969|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_026.wav|||This could be one such case, he declared.|
035970|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_027.wav|||It's not a solo.|
035971|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_028.wav|||The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|
035972|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_029.wav|||I fell in love with ballet.|
035973|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_030.wav|||That their music is truly, truly, truly great.|
035974|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_031.wav|||I had found my vision.|
035975|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_032.wav|||The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|
035976|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_033.wav|||But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.|
035977|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_034.wav|||We don't know the scale of need.|
035978|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_035.wav|||Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|
035979|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_036.wav|||We had a huge response to that campaign.|
035980|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_037.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
035981|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_038.wav|||I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|
035982|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_039.wav|||We're still talking with a few people.|
035983|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_040.wav|||We know you will not let us down.|
035984|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_041.wav|||He will never walk the streets again.|
035985|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_042.wav|||There are big names.|
035986|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_043.wav|||That argument has been won.|
035987|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_044.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
035988|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_045.wav|||I hope you will leave it at that.|
035989|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_046.wav|||We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|
035990|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_047.wav|||The bill would be massive.|
035991|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_048.wav|||He was just a journalist.|
035992|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_049.wav|||They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|
035993|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_050.wav|||Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.|
035994|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_051.wav|||I didn't have a clue.|
035995|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_052.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
035996|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_053.wav|||I have been coming here for nine years.|
035997|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_054.wav|||She has a wonderful mind.|
035998|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_055.wav|||There are just two tournaments remaining.|
035999|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_056.wav|||We're into that build-up now.|
036000|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_057.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
036001|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_058.wav|||I have had no social life at all.|
036002|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_059.wav|||Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|
036003|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_060.wav|||In short, the club was broke.|
036004|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_061.wav|||His charisma is all on the course.|
036005|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_062.wav|||I am still pretty young in this business.|
036006|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_063.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
036007|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_064.wav|||We're not the tourist board.|
036008|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_065.wav|||It was the same old story.|
036009|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_066.wav|||Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|
036010|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_067.wav|||The Commons is too outdated.|
036011|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_068.wav|||You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|

036013|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_070.wav|||It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|
036014|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_071.wav|||Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|
036015|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_072.wav|||Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|
036016|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_073.wav|||He would be with his peers.|
036017|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_074.wav|||They seem to be backing off from that.|
036018|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_075.wav|||This will be no easy option.|
036019|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_076.wav|||I wish they, too, would get a grip.|
036020|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_077.wav|||I am so sorry.|
036021|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_078.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|
036022|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_079.wav|||It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|
036023|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_080.wav|||We will see how he is after treatment.|
036024|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_081.wav|||I was there for five hours.|
036025|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_082.wav|||But then he changed his mind.|
036026|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_083.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
036027|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_084.wav|||They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|
036028|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_085.wav|||There are no excuses.|
036029|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_086.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
036030|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_087.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|
036031|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_088.wav|||He just wants to play.|
036032|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_089.wav|||It's very difficult and very worrying.|
036033|en-329-f|en|wav/p329_090.wav|||Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.|

037197|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_410.wav|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
037198|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_411.wav|||It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|
037199|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_412.wav|||I have not come in to take over.|
037200|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_413.wav|||Is this accurate?|
037201|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_414.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
037202|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_415.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
037203|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_416.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
037204|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_417.wav|||The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|
037205|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_418.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
037206|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_419.wav|||They were in good humour, too.|
037207|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_420.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
037208|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_421.wav|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
037209|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_422.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
037210|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_423.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
037211|en-333-f|en|wav/p333_424.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|
037212|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
037213|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
037214|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
037215|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
037216|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
037217|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037218|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037219|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037220|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
037221|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037222|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037223|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037224|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
037225|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
037226|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
037227|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
037228|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
037229|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
037230|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
037231|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
037232|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
037233|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
037234|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
037235|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
037236|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_025.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
037237|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_026.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
037238|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_027.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
037239|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_028.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
037240|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_029.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
037241|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_030.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
037242|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_031.wav|||It was no surprise.|
037243|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_032.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
037244|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_033.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|

037247|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_036.wav|||We could feel the heat.|
037248|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_037.wav|||Darrell was, however, adamant.|
037249|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_038.wav|||He was a member of the Tartan Army.|
037250|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_039.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
037251|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_040.wav|||I wanted to win so badly.|
037252|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_041.wav|||It was an accounting error.|
037253|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_042.wav|||I had enough on.|
037254|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_043.wav|||The offer of help is there for anyone.|
037255|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_044.wav|||There were no passengers on board.|
037256|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_045.wav|||And we're not there yet.|
037257|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_046.wav|||No meaningful response was issued.|
037258|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_047.wav|||And the funny thing is, they usually do.|
037259|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_048.wav|||Times have changed, but have they improved?|
037260|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_049.wav|||Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|
037261|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_050.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
037262|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_051.wav|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
037263|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_052.wav|||It is a form of physical exercise.|
037264|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_053.wav|||plays in dark blue.|
037265|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_054.wav|||But, by that time, of course, it is again.|
037266|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_055.wav|||It is something that we will put right.|
037267|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_056.wav|||Why do it?|
037268|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_057.wav|||It could take three days.|
037269|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_058.wav|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
037270|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_059.wav|||It was totally my fault.|
037271|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_060.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
037272|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_061.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
037273|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_062.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
037274|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_063.wav|||Tomorrow night is the important game.|
037275|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_064.wav|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
037276|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_065.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
037277|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_066.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
037278|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_067.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
037279|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_068.wav|||It was a move which appealed to him.|
037280|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_069.wav|||There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|
037281|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_070.wav|||He will need that machine.|
037282|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_071.wav|||But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|
037283|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_072.wav|||We are looking for volunteers.|
037284|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_073.wav|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
037285|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_074.wav|||It was very personal and very intimate.|
037286|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_075.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
037287|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_076.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
037288|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_077.wav|||They follow him everywhere.|
037289|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_078.wav|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
037290|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_079.wav|||Maybe that was the whole point.|
037291|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_080.wav|||The feeling between the two men was mutual.|
037292|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_081.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
037293|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_082.wav|||So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|
037294|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_083.wav|||This must be really short of ideas.|
037295|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_084.wav|||It was extremely cold.|
037296|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_085.wav|||They use them for everything.|
037297|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_086.wav|||We have the easy part.|
037298|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_087.wav|||I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|
037299|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_088.wav|||They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.|
037300|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_089.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
037301|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_090.wav|||Mr Miller is married with three children.|
037302|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_091.wav|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
037303|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_092.wav|||We already have them, all over Europe.|
037304|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_093.wav|||There are a lot of unanswered questions.|
037305|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_094.wav|||Libya is an easy target.|
037306|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_095.wav|||I thought they played very well.|
037307|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_096.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
037308|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_097.wav|||It means they actually control the programme.|
037309|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_098.wav|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
037310|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_099.wav|||They chose to side with terror.|
037311|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_100.wav|||Justice was not seen today.|
037312|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_101.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
037313|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_102.wav|||Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|
037314|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_103.wav|||We should just say no.|
037315|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_104.wav|||We are not out of touch with politics.|
037316|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_105.wav|||That was a gold medal for certain.|
037317|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_106.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
037318|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_107.wav|||I didn't make those adjustments.|
037319|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_108.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
037320|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_109.wav|||We have it on video.|
037321|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_110.wav|||Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|
037322|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_111.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
037323|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_112.wav|||It didn't take long.|
037324|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_113.wav|||This meeting is the path to salvation.|
037325|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_114.wav|||Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|
037326|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_115.wav|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
037327|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_116.wav|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
037328|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_117.wav|||He told the conference.|
037329|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_118.wav|||The sanctions are about collective punishment.|
037330|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_119.wav|||We tend to come good at the end.|
037331|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_120.wav|||He also received a medal of honour.|
037332|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_121.wav|||It's not one for the purist.|
037333|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_122.wav|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
037334|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_123.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
037335|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_124.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
037336|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_125.wav|||There is bound to be a formal complaint.|
037337|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_126.wav|||It is a time bomb.|
037338|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_127.wav|||It's a matter of huge concern.|
037339|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_128.wav|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
037340|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_129.wav|||We are taking advice on this.|
037341|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_130.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
037342|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_131.wav|||It was just an accident of birth.|
037343|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_132.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
037344|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_133.wav|||It was a simple question.|
037345|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_134.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
037346|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_135.wav|||I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.|
037347|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_136.wav|||By that time, however, it was already too late.|

037357|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_146.wav|||I would ask the fans to be patient.|
037358|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_147.wav|||It was so physical.|
037359|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_148.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
037360|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_149.wav|||He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.|
037361|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_150.wav|||Why is that?|
037362|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_151.wav|||It is extremely sad.|
037363|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_153.wav|||Europe is a hugely contentious issue.|
037364|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_154.wav|||It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|
037365|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_155.wav|||And therein lies the whole problem.|
037366|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_156.wav|||He was not deterred.|
037367|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_157.wav|||This commitment should be built upon.|
037368|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_158.wav|||This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|
037369|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_159.wav|||The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|
037370|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_160.wav|||That is not just my personal view.|
037371|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_161.wav|||The investment will be in the food.|
037372|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_162.wav|||But he was a full, working member of our staff.|
037373|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_163.wav|||The problem is the pitch.|
037374|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_164.wav|||That's as it should be.|
037375|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_165.wav|||It does seem a mystery.|

037377|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_167.wav|||He looked very sharp.|
037378|en-334-m|en|wav/p334_168.wav|||The fate of large numbers remains unknown.|

038481|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038482|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038483|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038484|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038485|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038486|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038487|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038488|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038489|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038490|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038491|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038492|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038493|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
038494|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038495|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038496|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038497|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
038498|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038499|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_025.wav|||They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|
038500|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_026.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|

038504|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_030.wav|||It was really good in the first week.|

038506|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_032.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|

038515|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_041.wav|||I didn't expect to get one.|
038516|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_042.wav|||It was electric, amazing.|
038517|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_043.wav|||I said to him.|
038518|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_044.wav|||Labour has been found out on public spending.|

038525|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_051.wav|||It means it is difficult.|
038526|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_052.wav|||But they were true stories.|
038527|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_053.wav|||I needed to get away.|
038528|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_054.wav|||I will make that point tonight.|
038529|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_055.wav|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|
038530|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_056.wav|||There are two things we have to do.|
038531|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_057.wav|||Are they going to work together again?|
038532|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_058.wav|||We need to do that every week.|
038533|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_059.wav|||It gives us something to work on.|

038544|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_070.wav|||It has only been rumours.|
038545|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_071.wav|||It is extremely fortunate.|
038546|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_072.wav|||Today is the first step in that process.|
038547|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_073.wav|||Several others were absent.|

038557|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_083.wav|||Or have they?|
038558|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_084.wav|||There is no change in the strategy.|
038559|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_085.wav|||I had a fortunate war.|
038560|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_086.wav|||It will probably be my last, too.|
038561|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_087.wav|||I am not completely insane.|
038562|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_088.wav|||We spoke about a few people.|

038567|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_093.wav|||We did it in one take.|
038568|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_094.wav|||He doesn't even know who he is.|
038569|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_095.wav|||It is hard to understand.|
038570|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_096.wav|||What will it be?|

038582|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_109.wav|||It was all over now.|
038583|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_110.wav|||But it was only a matter of time.|
038584|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_111.wav|||I always liked to get a laugh.|
038585|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_112.wav|||I still hope to go.|
038586|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_113.wav|||Sometimes they come off.|

038610|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_137.wav|||It was on fire.|
038611|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_138.wav|||I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|
038612|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_139.wav|||How can they tell?|
038613|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_140.wav|||My ambition is to make the cut.|
038614|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_141.wav|||It will be for the committee to decide.|
038615|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_142.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
038616|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_143.wav|||Rangers must be winners, it says.|
038617|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_144.wav|||He was part of the family.|
038618|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_145.wav|||I certainly think it should be there.|
038619|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_146.wav|||But it does not matter.|
038620|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_147.wav|||Hopefully we can put in a performance.|
038621|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_148.wav|||Sadly, he has a point.|
038622|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_149.wav|||It was so sad.|
038623|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_150.wav|||Mind you, all was not lost.|
038624|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_151.wav|||We were extremely lucky.|
038625|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_152.wav|||It was an amazing time.|
038626|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_153.wav|||In fact, the reasons are simple.|
038627|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_154.wav|||The hearing is expected to continue today.|
038628|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_155.wav|||It is just a matter of time.|
038629|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_156.wav|||This news is really depressing.|
038630|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_157.wav|||I'm not fit for anything else.|
038631|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_158.wav|||The day may come, but not for a while.|
038632|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_159.wav|||The enemy was time.|
038633|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_160.wav|||He would have done the same to me.|
038634|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_161.wav|||What were they told?|
038635|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_162.wav|||More cases are expected.|
038636|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_163.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
038637|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_164.wav|||It would be very dangerous.|
038638|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_165.wav|||How can they say that?|
038639|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_166.wav|||My condition is not bad.|
038640|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_167.wav|||Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.|
038641|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_168.wav|||I would like to make an impact, of course.|
038642|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_169.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
038643|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_170.wav|||The goal is clear.|
038644|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_171.wav|||Just think about the lines.|
038645|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_172.wav|||It all depends on the wind.|
038646|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_173.wav|||I was very influenced by him.|
038647|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_174.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
038648|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_175.wav|||This was much worse.|
038649|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_176.wav|||This was certainly not about money.|
038650|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_177.wav|||It is simple, but profound.|
038651|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_178.wav|||The funding is now there.|
038652|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_179.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
038653|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_180.wav|||A film is different from a book.|
038654|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_181.wav|||Within three days he was dead.|
038655|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_182.wav|||You'll find out on Saturday.|
038656|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_183.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
038657|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_184.wav|||We know that from recent experience.|
038658|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_185.wav|||From day one, we were a family.|
038659|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_186.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
038660|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_187.wav|||This could be wonderful.|
038661|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_188.wav|||He loved it, and so did they.|
038662|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_189.wav|||The other was a football match.|
038663|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_190.wav|||They have the players to do it.|
038664|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_191.wav|||Which is worse?|
038665|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_192.wav|||He has made a step forward.|
038666|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_193.wav|||That was very important.|
038667|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_194.wav|||This will have to change.|
038668|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_195.wav|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
038669|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_196.wav|||It was a very strong metaphor.|
038670|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_197.wav|||We are going to have a party.|
038671|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_198.wav|||I have no problem with that.|
038672|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_199.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
038673|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_200.wav|||I'm very happy that it exploded.|
038674|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_201.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
038675|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_202.wav|||Lester was like that.|
038676|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_203.wav|||Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.|
038677|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_204.wav|||That's a matter for them.|
038678|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_205.wav|||We were never told it was already decided.|
038679|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_206.wav|||It is part of our heritage.|
038680|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_207.wav|||It is not a road of life.|
038681|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_208.wav|||It is not as simple as that.|
038682|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_209.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
038683|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_210.wav|||Find them somebody they deserve.|
038684|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_211.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
038685|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_212.wav|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
038686|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_213.wav|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
038687|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_214.wav|||We're not getting involved.|
038688|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_215.wav|||The lottery has helped.|
038689|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_216.wav|||They know the language.|
038690|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_217.wav|||The acting left a lot to be desired.|
038691|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_218.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
038692|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_219.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
038693|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_220.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
038694|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_221.wav|||You cannot do that in a lobby.|
038695|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_222.wav|||We will all suffer as a result.|
038696|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_223.wav|||Without doubt, they can win the title.|
038697|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_224.wav|||What's it about?|
038698|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_225.wav|||We are looking to the future.|
038699|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_226.wav|||The signs are positive.|
038700|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_227.wav|||I called it right.|
038701|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_228.wav|||I see it as my job.|
038702|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_229.wav|||I have always believed in myself.|
038703|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_230.wav|||It has to be put in context.|
038704|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_231.wav|||I think we can get there.|
038705|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_232.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
038706|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_233.wav|||No, they have played well.|
038707|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_234.wav|||The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|
038708|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_235.wav|||The answer is obviously no.|
038709|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_236.wav|||I'll take it as it comes.|
038710|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_237.wav|||I think we're the better side.|
038711|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_238.wav|||We act because we must.|
038712|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_239.wav|||There are two mysteries.|
038713|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_240.wav|||The teacher would have approved.|
038714|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_241.wav|||Are you going to win?|
038715|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_242.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
038716|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_243.wav|||I could have been killed on that day.|
038717|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_244.wav|||They have to come up with a solution.|
038718|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_245.wav|||It is very enjoyable.|
038719|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_246.wav|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
038720|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_247.wav|||Did it work?|
038721|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_248.wav|||But that is for another day.|
038722|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_249.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
038723|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_250.wav|||It was not like that at all.|
038724|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_251.wav|||Police are appealing for witnesses.|
038725|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_252.wav|||I was very surprised.|
038726|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_253.wav|||We all knew they could do it.|
038727|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_254.wav|||It's about taking risks.|
038728|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_255.wav|||Why is this?|
038729|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_256.wav|||He is due in Israel tomorrow.|
038730|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_257.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
038731|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_258.wav|||There are not too many like him.|
038732|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_259.wav|||The memory is there.|
038733|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_260.wav|||It was an amazing experience.|
038734|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_261.wav|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
038735|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_262.wav|||He will go on the bench.|
038736|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_263.wav|||The police are hopeless.|
038737|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_264.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
038738|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_265.wav|||We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|
038739|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_266.wav|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
038740|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_267.wav|||That's the important thing.|
038741|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_268.wav|||Should he resign?|
038742|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_269.wav|||They have to live with the risk.|
038743|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_270.wav|||It is, but that's not the point.|
038744|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_271.wav|||It was my whole life.|
038745|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_272.wav|||It was a classic.|
038746|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_273.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
038747|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_274.wav|||However, it is going to happen.|
038748|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_275.wav|||This time it really could happen.|
038749|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_276.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
038750|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_277.wav|||That includes the equipment?|
038751|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_278.wav|||It does nothing for me.|
038752|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_279.wav|||That has been lost.|
038753|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_280.wav|||But that's another story.|
038754|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_281.wav|||I think it has worked.|
038755|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_282.wav|||No other family members could be contacted.|
038756|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_283.wav|||There is nothing to be gained from that.|
038757|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_284.wav|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
038758|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_285.wav|||But do not rely on it.|
038759|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_286.wav|||I made a mistake.|
038760|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_287.wav|||What do you want.|
038761|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_288.wav|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
038762|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_289.wav|||I think we could do well in Europe.|
038763|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_290.wav|||And yet, there has been no great impact.|
038764|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_291.wav|||Was that not awful?|
038765|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_292.wav|||Yesterday was a statement of intent.|
038766|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_293.wav|||I'm not there yet but it is close.|
038767|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_294.wav|||But it will not work again.|
038768|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_295.wav|||Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|
038769|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_296.wav|||I have nothing to say on that.|
038770|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_297.wav|||The rest is his own.|
038771|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_298.wav|||I have no worry about that.|
038772|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_299.wav|||There has been a fair bit in between, too.|
038773|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_300.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
038774|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_301.wav|||It turned out to have been three hours.|
038775|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_302.wav|||That is exactly right.|
038776|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_303.wav|||That is not good for golf!|
038777|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_304.wav|||He had planned to sell it.|
038778|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_305.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
038779|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_306.wav|||But it did not last.|
038780|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_307.wav|||They need to look after themselves.|
038781|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_308.wav|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
038782|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_309.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
038783|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_310.wav|||We have nothing to lose.|
038784|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_311.wav|||The first time it was rejected.|
038785|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_312.wav|||He did not report it.|
038786|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_313.wav|||No-one can take it in.|
038787|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_314.wav|||They were following his orders.|
038788|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_315.wav|||That is an entirely different discipline.|
038789|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_316.wav|||It was an insult.|
038790|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_317.wav|||Yet there is hope.|
038791|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_318.wav|||Referees in Scotland are very weak.|
038792|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_319.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
038793|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_320.wav|||That was a fairy tale.|
038794|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_321.wav|||I would love to do that.|
038795|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_322.wav|||You'll have to wait and see.|
038796|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_323.wav|||It wasn't the issue.|
038797|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_324.wav|||The number never came.|
038798|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_325.wav|||I really have to go now.|
038799|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_326.wav|||We are going to listen to Britain.|
038800|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_327.wav|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
038801|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_328.wav|||Words are not enough.|
038802|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_329.wav|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
038803|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_330.wav|||We have expected it.|
038804|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_331.wav|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
038805|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_332.wav|||Well, that was the plan.|
038806|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_333.wav|||The problem is fairly serious.|
038807|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_334.wav|||No decisions have been taken.|
038808|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_335.wav|||We won't do that.|
038809|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_336.wav|||It's the body that counts.|

038823|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_350.wav|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
038824|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_351.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
038825|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_352.wav|||My mind is the most important thing now.|
038826|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_353.wav|||I had nothing to lose.|
038827|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_354.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
038828|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_355.wav|||I thought to myself.|
038829|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_356.wav|||Could it be?|

038833|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_360.wav|||You have to keep the focus alive.|
038834|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_361.wav|||It could have been a ceilidh.|

038859|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_386.wav|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038860|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_387.wav|||Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|
038861|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_388.wav|||I cannot describe it.|

038871|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_398.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
038872|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_399.wav|||It is about more than Scotland.|

038886|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_413.wav|||I saw it later in the news.|

038891|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_418.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
038892|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_419.wav|||We should have been rewarded for producing.|
038893|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_420.wav|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
038894|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_421.wav|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
038895|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_422.wav|||There is no shortage of questions.|
038896|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_423.wav|||Couldn't see the point.|
038897|en-339-f|en|wav/p339_424.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
039321|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
039322|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
039323|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
039324|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
039325|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
039326|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
039327|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
039328|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
039329|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
039330|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
039331|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
039332|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039333|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|
039334|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
039335|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
039336|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
039337|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
039338|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
039339|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
039340|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039341|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039342|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
039343|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
039344|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
039345|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_025.wav|||This guy is never going to give up.|
039346|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_026.wav|||That's interesting to me.|
039347|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_027.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|
039348|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_028.wav|||It is only one night, after all.|
039349|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_029.wav|||The injuries are not too serious.|
039350|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_030.wav|||Gilbert was not amused.|
039351|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_031.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
039352|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_032.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
039353|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_033.wav|||Everything was up for grabs.|
039354|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_034.wav|||It's easy to see why.|
039355|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_035.wav|||I am proud of moments like that.|
039356|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_036.wav|||That was no surprise to me.|
039357|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_037.wav|||This has been blown out of all proportion.|
039358|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_038.wav|||There is no escape.|
039359|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_039.wav|||It's wonderful to have won.|

039361|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_041.wav|||He was arrested, but later released without charge.|
039362|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_042.wav|||I fell into it by accident.|
039363|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_043.wav|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
039364|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_044.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
039365|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_045.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
039366|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_046.wav|||Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|
039367|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_047.wav|||If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|
039368|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_048.wav|||All the lads are totally focused on that.|
039369|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_049.wav|||Today is not about contracts.|
039370|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_050.wav|||That says something for his strength of character.|
039371|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_051.wav|||We are going for it.|
039372|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_052.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
039373|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_053.wav|||It's to do with play.|
039374|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_054.wav|||However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|
039375|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_055.wav|||I've just got to do this.|
039376|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_056.wav|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|
039377|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_057.wav|||So the process was refined.|
039378|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_058.wav|||Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.|
039379|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_059.wav|||I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|

039384|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_064.wav|||This is the crossroads.|
039385|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_065.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|
039386|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_066.wav|||He is pretty upset.|
039387|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_067.wav|||And who would argue with that?|

039389|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_069.wav|||We must put a marker down.|
039390|en-341-f|en|wav/p341_070.wav|||The decision is an absolute disgrace.|

040200|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_084.wav|||All our futures will already have been decided.|
040201|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_085.wav|||I would have been shot dead in bed.|
040202|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_086.wav|||He insisted that his staff were too.|
040203|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_087.wav|||They should come clean.|
040204|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_088.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
040205|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_089.wav|||I believe that so strongly.|
040206|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_090.wav|||That, though, is an old story.|
040207|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_091.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
040208|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_092.wav|||They don't work anymore anyway.|
040209|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_093.wav|||It's about time something was done about equipment.|
040210|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_094.wav|||It was a funny feeling.|
040211|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_095.wav|||He was at it again yesterday.|
040212|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_096.wav|||You can't go on forever.|
040213|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_097.wav|||So far this season this approach is working.|
040214|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_098.wav|||However, his involvement was instant.|
040215|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_099.wav|||It has to work.|
040216|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_100.wav|||It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|
040217|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_101.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
040218|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_102.wav|||There's something about being cut off.|
040219|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_103.wav|||This is his personal life.|
040220|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_104.wav|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
040221|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_105.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
040222|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_106.wav|||It's as eventful as it is momentous.|
040223|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_107.wav|||I was going to help with the dinner.|
040224|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_108.wav|||Would you pay to come and see it?|
040225|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_109.wav|||What are they like?|
040226|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_110.wav|||I would probably have to agree with him.|
040227|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_111.wav|||They were back in favour with the SAC.|
040228|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_112.wav|||He had a moustache.|
040229|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_113.wav|||I have been thinking about that this week.|
040230|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_114.wav|||Let's get it on.|
040231|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_115.wav|||Together they will attempt to express the whole.|
040232|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_116.wav|||Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.|
040233|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_117.wav|||It is really good news.|
040234|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_118.wav|||We just want a fair deal.|
040235|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_119.wav|||I'll just have to live with that.|
040236|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_120.wav|||Neither of them was badly hurt.|
040237|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_121.wav|||He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.|
040238|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_122.wav|||We wanted it left for a wee while.|
040239|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_123.wav|||At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|
040240|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_124.wav|||It is sad and frustrating.|
040241|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_125.wav|||Our intentions are real.|
040242|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_126.wav|||The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|
040243|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_127.wav|||Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.|
040244|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_128.wav|||She has left the island.|
040245|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_129.wav|||That will be the case on Tuesday.|
040246|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_130.wav|||As to rugby, well, no-one knows.|
040247|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_131.wav|||It certainly should not be used too often.|
040248|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_132.wav|||The whole matter is done and dusted.|
040249|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_133.wav|||I don't know where that one came from.|
040250|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_134.wav|||The shooting created panic in the street.|
040251|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_135.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
040252|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_136.wav|||Our destiny is in our own hands.|
040253|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_137.wav|||That's not fair to the supporters.|
040254|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_138.wav|||I was on my own.|
040255|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_139.wav|||They were part of our own family.|
040256|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_140.wav|||It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.|
040257|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_141.wav|||I don't have any perspective on it.|
040258|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_142.wav|||Scotland has lost a great man.|
040259|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_143.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
040260|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_144.wav|||In fact, they will not be disciplined.|
040261|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_145.wav|||His name has not been released.|
040262|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_146.wav|||For some, it was more painful than others.|
040263|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_147.wav|||It plainly does not work.|
040264|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_148.wav|||His words were not audible.|
040265|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_149.wav|||That's a huge amount.|
040266|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_150.wav|||See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.|
040267|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_151.wav|||It was even worse than at home.|
040268|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_152.wav|||I still think he will win.|
040269|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_153.wav|||But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|
040270|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_154.wav|||Normally it would be four minutes.|
040271|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_155.wav|||It may have been a cry for help.|
040272|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_156.wav|||But the damage had been done.|
040273|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_157.wav|||No, you couldn't make it up.|
040274|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_158.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
040275|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_159.wav|||However, he did not stay there very long.|
040276|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_160.wav|||And so they have.|
040277|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_161.wav|||I have a great respect for her.|
040278|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_162.wav|||I suggest a new plan.|
040279|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_163.wav|||IT takes the biscuit.|
040280|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_164.wav|||But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|
040281|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_165.wav|||We don't have a solution to the problem.|
040282|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_166.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
040283|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_167.wav|||The result is utterly compelling.|
040284|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_168.wav|||But it won't be the same.|
040285|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_169.wav|||Other forces were, however, at work.|
040286|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_170.wav|||Inspiring public confidence is crucial.|
040287|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_171.wav|||It is a hobby for me.|
040288|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_172.wav|||If only the acting profession was that simple.|
040289|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_173.wav|||It was like a kick in the belly.|
040290|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_174.wav|||Bombing is the easy option.|
040291|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_175.wav|||We should have gone solo.|
040292|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_176.wav|||Directing, if you like.|
040293|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_177.wav|||That will be the case.|
040294|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_178.wav|||Now, it's all right.|
040295|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_179.wav|||All will be revealed in due course.|
040296|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_180.wav|||They have known the hard times.|
040297|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_181.wav|||We don't know what happened.|
040298|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_182.wav|||You cannot enter the clubhouse.|
040299|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_183.wav|||They had seven children.|
040300|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_184.wav|||That in itself is an erotic experience.|
040301|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_185.wav|||Death is outside the language.|
040302|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_186.wav|||You have a plan?|
040303|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_187.wav|||It's all too early.|
040304|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_188.wav|||Everything in the world was focused on London.|
040305|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_189.wav|||We've seen that time and time again.|
040306|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_190.wav|||I was never alone with her, right?|
040307|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_191.wav|||It's not only my respect for them.|
040308|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_192.wav|||Tonight's matches European Championship.|
040309|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_193.wav|||This is a very high price.|
040310|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_194.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
040311|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_195.wav|||I never want to have any children.|
040312|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_196.wav|||Business has never been so bad.|
040313|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_197.wav|||There is no way to do this.|
040314|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_198.wav|||Edinburgh was not included in the survey.|
040315|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_199.wav|||I know my sons.|
040316|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_200.wav|||Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|
040317|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_201.wav|||It was too close to call.|
040318|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_202.wav|||But who is the killer?|
040319|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_203.wav|||No, it's never been mentioned.|
040320|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_204.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
040321|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_205.wav|||The devil, of course, will be in the detail.|
040322|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_206.wav|||Then another one came.|
040323|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_207.wav|||Progress is being made but it is slow.|
040324|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_208.wav|||Everything has been destroyed.|
040325|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_209.wav|||The Lobby is not failing.|
040326|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_210.wav|||But it is looking very positive.|
040327|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_211.wav|||Drugs are getting through.|
040328|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_212.wav|||He would have come into the house.|
040329|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_213.wav|||I want to put myself on discussion also.|
040330|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_214.wav|||It happens in real life.|
040331|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_215.wav|||At the time, he was a living legend.|
040332|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_216.wav|||And we will do it.|
040333|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_217.wav|||It's a human tragedy.|
040334|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_218.wav|||But we are losing that connection.|
040335|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_219.wav|||I am going to fight to the end.|
040336|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_220.wav|||Either group is living in fantasy land.|
040337|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_221.wav|||It's the right thing.|
040338|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_222.wav|||That was a disgraceful performance.|
040339|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_223.wav|||Must have been at the bar.|
040340|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_224.wav|||But this is just the start.|
040341|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_225.wav|||I can't get away from it.|
040342|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_226.wav|||I believe in the Union.|
040343|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_227.wav|||SCOTLAND has shown the way.|
040344|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_228.wav|||But he is not hopeful.|
040345|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_229.wav|||It will be all about the Olympics.|
040346|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_230.wav|||They are very frightened.|
040347|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_231.wav|||We have all been there at some point.|
040348|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_232.wav|||This is my homeland.|
040349|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_233.wav|||The game was up.|
040350|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_234.wav|||That is not an easy thing.|
040351|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_235.wav|||Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|
040352|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_236.wav|||I didn't know where they were.|
040353|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_237.wav|||Rangers are my life.|
040354|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_238.wav|||Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.|
040355|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_239.wav|||Three weeks later, he resigned.|
040356|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_240.wav|||There are two options.|
040357|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_241.wav|||I can't describe it.|
040358|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_242.wav|||Surely it should be the other way round.|
040359|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_243.wav|||There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|
040360|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_244.wav|||I get on him, he gets on me.|
040361|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_245.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
040362|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_246.wav|||I am appalled by this news.|
040363|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_247.wav|||No injuries were reported.|
040364|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_248.wav|||It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|
040365|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_249.wav|||It is understood he had been stabbed.|
040366|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_250.wav|||It's too much work.|
040367|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_251.wav|||We were extremely arrogant.|
040368|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_252.wav|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|
040369|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_253.wav|||THE waiting game continues.|
040370|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_254.wav|||Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|
040371|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_255.wav|||I don't think he was being very fair.|
040372|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_256.wav|||You've got to fight to stay up.|
040373|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_257.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
040374|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_258.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
040375|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_259.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
040376|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_260.wav|||What is so unusual about this case?|
040377|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_261.wav|||Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.|
040378|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_262.wav|||But this is different.|
040379|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_263.wav|||I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|
040380|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_264.wav|||It doesn't look good.|
040381|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_265.wav|||That will not change.|
040382|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_267.wav|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
040383|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_268.wav|||Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.|
040384|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_269.wav|||It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.|
040385|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_270.wav|||There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.|
040386|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_271.wav|||They've been at it for five hours.|
040387|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_272.wav|||This action could have been avoided.|
040388|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_273.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
040389|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_274.wav|||And they still have the final to come.|
040390|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_275.wav|||Anyone else can apply.|
040391|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_276.wav|||He looked like a schoolboy.|
040392|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_277.wav|||It was like the old days.|
040393|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_278.wav|||But that is about to change.|
040394|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_279.wav|||The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.|
040395|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_280.wav|||We can build on that.|
040396|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_281.wav|||It could be a danger.|
040397|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_282.wav|||We are not going to be complacent.|
040398|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_283.wav|||The only problem was, they were on himself.|
040399|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_284.wav|||His body was found in May.|
040400|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_285.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
040401|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_286.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|
040402|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_287.wav|||I'm sure you all can relate to that.|
040403|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_288.wav|||My wife is coming over at the weekend.|
040404|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_289.wav|||Sure, he is the best player in the world.|
040405|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_290.wav|||It starts to get you down.|
040406|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_291.wav|||I don't think we could have expected better.|
040407|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_292.wav|||My life has been turned upside down.|
040408|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_293.wav|||Somebody has to speak up for common sense.|
040409|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_294.wav|||But they miss the whole point.|
040410|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_295.wav|||You have to count on other people.|
040411|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_296.wav|||I said, What was that about?|
040412|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_297.wav|||Immediate action must be taken.|
040413|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_298.wav|||This could prove a problem.|
040414|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_299.wav|||I was a local hero.|
040415|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_300.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
040416|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_301.wav|||It will be extremely difficult for him.|
040417|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_302.wav|||It's a gigantic con.|
040418|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_303.wav|||Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|
040419|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_304.wav|||This club have been fair to me.|
040420|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_305.wav|||I didn't know she could do that.|
040421|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_306.wav|||What does she consider her greatest achievement?|
040422|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_307.wav|||This is too much like Scotland.|
040423|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_308.wav|||I can't say anything about any figure.|
040424|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_309.wav|||A counter reaction was.|
040425|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_310.wav|||That goes back a long way.|
040426|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_311.wav|||I wouldn't have had the abandon.|
040427|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_312.wav|||She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|
040428|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_313.wav|||They were not missing much.|
040429|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_314.wav|||It should not make the same mistake again.|
040430|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_315.wav|||Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|
040431|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_316.wav|||The record companies have gone through the floor.|
040432|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_317.wav|||It's always a dilemma.|
040433|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_318.wav|||As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.|
040434|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_319.wav|||Is she in trouble?|
040435|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_320.wav|||It is a symbolic concert.|
040436|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_321.wav|||They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|
040437|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_322.wav|||It is a very beautiful city.|
040438|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_323.wav|||She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|
040439|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_324.wav|||But could it afford to run it?|
040440|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_325.wav|||I am very happy with him.|
040441|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_326.wav|||I was waiting for that question.|
040442|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_327.wav|||Her body was found on Monday morning.|
040443|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_328.wav|||I am not against a further inquiry.|
040444|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_329.wav|||His father said, My son was lucky.|
040445|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_330.wav|||WHO would have thought it?|
040446|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_331.wav|||We will win the argument.|
040447|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_332.wav|||Five years later, the deception continued.|
040448|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_333.wav|||I might get an injury very easily.|
040449|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_334.wav|||I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|
040450|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_335.wav|||Stock markets will be watching closely.|
040451|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_336.wav|||I just want to do the good work.|
040452|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_337.wav|||I'm very happy tonight.|
040453|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_338.wav|||He was overwhelmed by the response.|
040454|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_339.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
040455|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_340.wav|||Now it was serious.|
040456|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_341.wav|||This is his first movie.|
040457|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_342.wav|||He is already in place.|
040458|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_343.wav|||No one would believe him.|
040459|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_344.wav|||We live in shorthand.|
040460|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_345.wav|||But something has been lost in the translation.|
040461|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_346.wav|||Spent three months alone at sea.|
040462|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_347.wav|||I made a big mistake.|
040463|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_348.wav|||I just know it's a lot.|
040464|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_349.wav|||I saw one body.|
040465|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_350.wav|||I am very happy.|
040466|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_351.wav|||There was no discussion about it.|
040467|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_352.wav|||Three hours later, the man was free.|
040468|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_353.wav|||It was a very big win for us.|
040469|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_354.wav|||I've never felt affection for Emu.|
040470|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_355.wav|||Everything is up for grabs.|
040471|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_356.wav|||We had a good time.|
040472|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_357.wav|||I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.|
040473|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_358.wav|||This was a good performance.|
040474|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_359.wav|||However, the snow was welcomed by some.|
040475|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_360.wav|||It is not simple.|
040476|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_361.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
040477|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_362.wav|||Our task is to complete the picture.|
040478|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_363.wav|||It is a road of death.|
040479|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_364.wav|||The Government would be ready, they said.|
040480|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_365.wav|||Her life is now back on track.|
040481|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_366.wav|||I said at the time it was wrong.|
040482|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_367.wav|||By now he was very ill with cancer.|
040483|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_368.wav|||Anything that was going, really.|
040484|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_369.wav|||He will take it in his stride.|
040485|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_370.wav|||I don't believe a word of it.|
040486|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_371.wav|||I couldn't put my finger on it.|
040487|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_372.wav|||People can really get themselves in a mess.|
040488|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_373.wav|||The winner will be announced in December.|
040489|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_374.wav|||This is bound to happen.|
040490|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_375.wav|||Suddenly, there was an audience.|
040491|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_376.wav|||It has not yet opened to pupils.|
040492|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_377.wav|||The letters are going out today.|
040493|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_378.wav|||I did not name it.|
040494|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_379.wav|||And therein lies the problem.|
040495|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_380.wav|||I also thought, This is a feature film.|
040496|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_381.wav|||McMaster had already seen the first part.|
040497|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_382.wav|||Or is it?|
040498|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_383.wav|||Is he going to look after them?|
040499|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_384.wav|||They are appealing for witnesses.|
040500|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_385.wav|||This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.|
040501|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_386.wav|||It is quite simple.|
040502|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_389.wav|||It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|
040503|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_390.wav|||His instructions were clear.|
040504|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_391.wav|||There is ample evidence.|
040505|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_392.wav|||It was a game we had to win.|
040506|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_393.wav|||I've never had problems with any football managers.|
040507|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_394.wav|||To begin with it looks good.|
040508|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_395.wav|||I won't go back to Holland.|
040509|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_396.wav|||There is still a long way to go.|
040510|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_397.wav|||Almost overnight, he found his voice.|
040511|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_398.wav|||This was a unique election.|
040512|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_399.wav|||It was still there last night.|
040513|en-345-m|en|wav/p345_400.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
041359|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
041360|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
041361|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041362|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041363|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041364|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041365|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041366|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041367|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041368|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041369|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041370|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041371|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041372|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041373|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041374|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041375|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041376|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041377|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041378|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041379|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041380|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041381|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041382|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041383|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_025.wav|||You can never take a win for granted.|
041384|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_026.wav|||My conscience is not clear.|
041385|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_027.wav|||Is that it?|
041386|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_028.wav|||You have been warned.|
041387|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_029.wav|||You are not allowed to do that.|
041388|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_030.wav|||That depends on Rangers.|
041389|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_031.wav|||There are two problems.|
041390|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_032.wav|||Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|
041391|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_033.wav|||It's something which is very important to me.|
041392|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_034.wav|||For once he was wrong.|
041393|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_035.wav|||He would not have to explain.|
041394|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_036.wav|||I want to deliver a learning society.|
041395|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_037.wav|||We are just happy that hasn't happened.|
041396|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_038.wav|||I had to be into it.|
041397|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_039.wav|||I'm so grateful for that.|
041398|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_040.wav|||It's not been a good year.|
041399|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_041.wav|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|
041400|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_042.wav|||I have no intention of resigning today.|
041401|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_043.wav|||That has now gone.|
041402|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_044.wav|||Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.|
041403|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_045.wav|||This will take up to nine months.|
041404|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_046.wav|||And maybe they have.|
041405|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_047.wav|||Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|
041406|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_048.wav|||Is he conscious?|
041407|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_049.wav|||But we are confident.|
041408|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_050.wav|||It is like a football team.|
041409|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_051.wav|||When he came to see me on Monday.|
041410|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_052.wav|||That's a concern to me.|
041411|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_053.wav|||She said she was really sorry.|
041412|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_054.wav|||That will be important.|
041413|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_055.wav|||But here it is also very bad.|
041414|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_056.wav|||That view has not altered.|
041415|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_057.wav|||It was very full anyway.|
041416|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_058.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
041417|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_059.wav|||The incidents are not believed to be linked.|
041418|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_060.wav|||But there is no easy option.|
041419|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_061.wav|||I can't believe she is dead.|
041420|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_062.wav|||No person was charged.|
041421|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_063.wav|||But it would say that.|
041422|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_064.wav|||Most of the works are small in scale.|
041423|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_065.wav|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
041424|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_066.wav|||Only the bomber was killed.|
041425|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_067.wav|||But he just carried on anyway.|
041426|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_068.wav|||Nor was it a game without its lessons.|
041427|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_069.wav|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
041428|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_070.wav|||His presence was very important.|
041429|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_071.wav|||What happens next?|
041430|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_072.wav|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
041431|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_073.wav|||The bombing begins in five minutes.|
041432|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_074.wav|||That took two weeks.|
041433|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_075.wav|||It's worth it, though.|
041434|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_076.wav|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
041435|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_077.wav|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
041436|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_078.wav|||The question was simple enough.|
041437|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_079.wav|||The voters rejected us.|
041438|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_080.wav|||There was a definite prejudice.|
041439|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_081.wav|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
041440|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_082.wav|||We never publicise it.|
041441|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_083.wav|||You will be very welcome.|
041442|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_084.wav|||His musicals were very much of their time.|
041443|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_085.wav|||He became enchanted with the process.|
041444|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_086.wav|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
041445|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_087.wav|||It seems very odd.|
041446|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_088.wav|||They couldn't keep it together.|
041447|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_089.wav|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
041448|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_090.wav|||We will continue to provide support for them.|
041449|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_091.wav|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
041450|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_092.wav|||It was looking bad.|
041451|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_093.wav|||That's what makes it interesting.|
041452|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_094.wav|||It's nice to be involved.|
041453|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_095.wav|||It's not a game.|
041454|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_096.wav|||Buildings are about people.|
041455|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_097.wav|||There is much work to do.|
041456|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_098.wav|||The release attracted little attention.|
041457|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_099.wav|||It was the dreaded sentence.|
041458|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_100.wav|||I have never considered it.|
041459|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_101.wav|||It is not in the public interest.|
041460|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_102.wav|||They had been forced to walk.|
041461|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_103.wav|||It is harder than you think.|
041462|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_104.wav|||The call was ignored.|
041463|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_105.wav|||I am looking forward to it.|
041464|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_106.wav|||Consumers will also benefit.|
041465|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_107.wav|||That would be even more disastrous.|
041466|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_108.wav|||We opened up and everything was gone.|
041467|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_109.wav|||It is looking very special.|
041468|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_110.wav|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
041469|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_111.wav|||People were hitting the floor.|
041470|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_112.wav|||She was close to suicide at one stage.|
041471|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_113.wav|||They took a risk.|
041472|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_114.wav|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
041473|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_115.wav|||It has no place in football.|
041474|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_116.wav|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
041475|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_117.wav|||This is a classic.|
041476|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_118.wav|||He played it like a veteran.|
041477|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_119.wav|||I have spoken to head office.|
041478|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_120.wav|||I'm not thinking about anyone else.|
041479|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_121.wav|||They will run a mile.|
041480|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_122.wav|||When she went off it was quite amazing.|
041481|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_123.wav|||Britain has never had it so good.|
041482|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_124.wav|||So many people will be affected by this.|
041483|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_125.wav|||It was all very good stuff.|
041484|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_126.wav|||Or was it?|
041485|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_127.wav|||We are under no illusions about this.|
041486|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_128.wav|||But they are a good team.|
041487|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_129.wav|||We have a long way to go.|
041488|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_130.wav|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
041489|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_131.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
041490|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_132.wav|||I knew that we needed to get out.|
041491|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_133.wav|||I had a train to catch.|
041492|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_134.wav|||And this game is all about belief.|
041493|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_135.wav|||I am ready for that.|
041494|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_136.wav|||It is a fantasy.|
041495|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_137.wav|||The only safe investment is cash.|
041496|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_138.wav|||That's the way they are.|
041497|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_139.wav|||Elections would follow in about two years.|
041498|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_140.wav|||We are trying to be realistic.|
041499|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_141.wav|||That was the theory.|
041500|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_142.wav|||Or so it seemed.|
041501|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_143.wav|||Now we look forward to it.|
041502|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_144.wav|||That was worth it.|
041503|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_145.wav|||What's it going to be then?|
041504|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_146.wav|||Who was being affected?|
041505|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_147.wav|||Our players are exhausted.|
041506|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_148.wav|||It is deeply frustrating.|
041507|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_149.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
041508|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_150.wav|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
041509|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_151.wav|||This has been carried out.|
041510|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_152.wav|||Our time is up.|
041511|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_153.wav|||It was a moment of madness.|
041512|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_154.wav|||But other Ministers are not convinced.|
041513|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_155.wav|||First meeting was next week.|
041514|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_156.wav|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|
041515|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_157.wav|||Conditions were very difficult for the players.|
041516|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_158.wav|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
041517|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_159.wav|||I didn't think we deserved to go out.|
041518|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_160.wav|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
041519|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_161.wav|||I told them they shouldn't say that.|
041520|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_162.wav|||I don't know how they do it.|
041521|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_163.wav|||Little is known about them.|
041522|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_164.wav|||It is a new company for Scotland.|
041523|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_165.wav|||We're very unhappy about it.|
041524|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_166.wav|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041525|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_167.wav|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
041526|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_168.wav|||It was extremely difficult.|
041527|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_169.wav|||It is about the script for me.|
041528|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_170.wav|||I have a good feeling about this.|
041529|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_171.wav|||And the results were impressive.|
041530|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_172.wav|||The next game is today.|
041531|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_173.wav|||Hopefully it will be a good day.|
041532|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_174.wav|||I was a silly bastard.|
041533|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_175.wav|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
041534|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_176.wav|||The process will start tomorrow.|
041535|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_177.wav|||Was the punishment excessive?|
041536|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_178.wav|||The police have an awful lot to explain.|
041537|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_179.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
041538|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_180.wav|||I could easy do that.|
041539|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_181.wav|||We are really impressed.|
041540|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_182.wav|||I try to be clear in the narrative.|
041541|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_183.wav|||You have to wait.|
041542|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_184.wav|||I did not see anything to begin with.|
041543|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_185.wav|||It's their moment of choice.|
041544|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_186.wav|||I certainly do not agree with that.|
041545|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_187.wav|||It was a disaster of a race.|
041546|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_188.wav|||Only one person can claim the credit.|
041547|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_189.wav|||Maintain the highest standards.|
041548|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_190.wav|||What could we do?|
041549|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_191.wav|||O Neill has delivered.|
041550|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_192.wav|||But there was no going back.|
041551|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_193.wav|||There are some good people in there.|
041552|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_194.wav|||But it won't make a difference.|
041553|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_195.wav|||I'm not going to blame the band.|
041554|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_196.wav|||I think that he got the message.|
041555|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_197.wav|||Here it was very subdued.|
041556|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_198.wav|||Stardom is a funny thing.|
041557|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_199.wav|||They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|
041558|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_200.wav|||The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|
041559|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_201.wav|||I sincerely hope not.|
041560|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_202.wav|||I'm really looking forward to that.|
041561|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_203.wav|||She would say he was still the best.|
041562|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_204.wav|||It is dangerous and it is a lie.|
041563|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_205.wav|||We didn't, and it worked for us.|
041564|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_206.wav|||No-one has used it since then.|
041565|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_207.wav|||The baby was dead.|
041566|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_208.wav|||That remains the unanswered question.|
041567|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_209.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
041568|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_210.wav|||They tried to give her advice.|
041569|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_211.wav|||We should have no more problems.|
041570|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_212.wav|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
041571|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_213.wav|||An announcement is expected soon.|
041572|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_214.wav|||It was one of those things.|
041573|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_215.wav|||I can understand that.|
041574|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_216.wav|||But sometimes it was even worse.|
041575|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_217.wav|||We had to work hard for it.|
041576|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_218.wav|||That's a big reduction.|
041577|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_219.wav|||There will be good prospects ahead.|
041578|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_220.wav|||I was pleased about that.|
041579|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_221.wav|||That has not changed.|
041580|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_222.wav|||It's a creative energy.|
041581|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_223.wav|||We are not conducting the review.|
041582|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_224.wav|||It just never comes together.|
041583|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_225.wav|||The club has never won it.|
041584|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_226.wav|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
041585|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_227.wav|||So it was at Easter Road.|
041586|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_228.wav|||It will be a huge difference.|
041587|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_229.wav|||Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|
041588|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_230.wav|||The characters are always the first attraction.|
041589|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_231.wav|||We've got better players here.|
041590|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_232.wav|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
041591|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_233.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
041592|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_234.wav|||So what's it all about?|
041593|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_235.wav|||I think he was lost for words.|
041594|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_236.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041595|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_237.wav|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
041596|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_238.wav|||This is a historic occasion.|
041597|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_239.wav|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
041598|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_240.wav|||And what happens?|
041599|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_241.wav|||It is all very upbeat.|
041600|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_242.wav|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
041601|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_243.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
041602|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_244.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
041603|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_245.wav|||We deserved the draw.|
041604|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_246.wav|||Just one of those things, we suppose.|
041605|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_247.wav|||It's up to the defence team.|
041606|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_248.wav|||No one was injured.|
041607|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_249.wav|||We have had our debate.|
041608|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_250.wav|||It is part of his game.|
041609|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_251.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
041610|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_252.wav|||But it was too late.|
041611|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_253.wav|||I didn't see the point.|
041612|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_254.wav|||It seems a shame to leave it.|
041613|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_255.wav|||Who would have thought it?|
041614|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_256.wav|||They were all on a mission.|
041615|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_257.wav|||Human beings are always the same.|
041616|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_258.wav|||You will gain from that.|
041617|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_259.wav|||It makes me feel difficult.|
041618|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_260.wav|||We couldn't believe it at first.|
041619|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_261.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
041620|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_262.wav|||He could still be President.|
041621|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_263.wav|||It can take a long time.|
041622|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_264.wav|||I don't intend to do so now.|
041623|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_265.wav|||There is no answer to it.|
041624|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_266.wav|||He was pleased with his display.|
041625|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_267.wav|||The first time you read a play.|
041626|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_268.wav|||There was no let-up for the minnows.|
041627|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_269.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
041628|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_270.wav|||He is having a nightmare.|
041629|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_271.wav|||That was six years ago.|
041630|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_272.wav|||Players have to accept this.|
041631|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_273.wav|||He is completely committed to us.|
041632|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_274.wav|||Neither had the public.|
041633|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_275.wav|||It disappeared into the cup.|
041634|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_276.wav|||They might well be right.|
041635|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_277.wav|||I have no further comment to make.|
041636|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_278.wav|||The warning is timely.|
041637|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_279.wav|||Those were the days.|
041638|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_280.wav|||The joint bid is still on course.|
041639|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_281.wav|||A press conference is about politics.|
041640|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_282.wav|||It was important to bring them all together.|
041641|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_283.wav|||We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|
041642|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_284.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
041643|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_285.wav|||These things happen in football but shouldn't.|
041644|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_286.wav|||It looks as though he will be right.|
041645|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_287.wav|||We know the fight is going to happen.|
041646|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_288.wav|||I have played well the past two days.|
041647|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_289.wav|||Is it on a building site?|
041648|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_290.wav|||That is the key.|
041649|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_291.wav|||We've been here before.|
041650|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_292.wav|||I am in a good position.|
041651|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_293.wav|||I have never been unemployed.|
041652|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_294.wav|||We are in it for the long-term.|
041653|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_295.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
041654|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_296.wav|||I believe it will happen.|
041655|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_297.wav|||And Michael was just great.|
041656|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_298.wav|||He did it well.|
041657|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_299.wav|||Why have you decided to get married?|
041658|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_300.wav|||Is it all real?|
041659|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_301.wav|||He will be missed.|
041660|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_302.wav|||I would not descend to that level.|
041661|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_303.wav|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
041662|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_304.wav|||We will not tolerate it.|
041663|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_305.wav|||I'm really proud of her.|
041664|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_306.wav|||What does this mean?|
041665|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_307.wav|||They are not falling now.|
041666|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_308.wav|||We are not physical at all.|
041667|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_309.wav|||Have we not been here before?|
041668|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_310.wav|||I've been waiting a long time.|
041669|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_311.wav|||The meaning is very profound and complex.|
041670|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_312.wav|||You just have to get on with it.|
041671|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_313.wav|||The response from everyone was wonderful.|
041672|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_314.wav|||And that match was played in June.|
041673|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_315.wav|||We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|
041674|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_316.wav|||I don't mean in a frightening way.|
041675|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_317.wav|||He is a sort of a mystery figure.|
041676|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_318.wav|||I have learned a lot.|
041677|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_319.wav|||It won't be their last.|
041678|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_320.wav|||You've got to have both sides.|
041679|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_321.wav|||He has yet to receive a reply.|
041680|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_322.wav|||It has been only average.|
041681|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_323.wav|||He should be worried about me.|
041682|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_324.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
041683|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_325.wav|||For me, any manager is good.|
041684|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_326.wav|||Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|
041685|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_327.wav|||That was the gimmick.|
041686|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_328.wav|||He refused to name the survivors.|
041687|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_329.wav|||He has changed my life forever.|
041688|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_330.wav|||I have no idea.|
041689|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_331.wav|||This plan is all about respect.|
041690|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_332.wav|||I don't think he played his best.|
041691|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_333.wav|||Pakistan denied the report.|
041692|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_334.wav|||It will be up to the government.|
041693|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_335.wav|||That is a tragedy.|
041694|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_336.wav|||I am very happy.|
041695|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_337.wav|||A child is not a product.|
041696|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_338.wav|||But this is nonsense.|
041697|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_339.wav|||You can't get the experience in Austria.|
041698|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_340.wav|||I'm going to miss it.|
041699|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_341.wav|||There will be no backing down.|
041700|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_342.wav|||The atmosphere was excellent.|
041701|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_343.wav|||That must have had an effect.|
041702|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_344.wav|||They have brought in the replacement.|
041703|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_345.wav|||How did it all come about?|
041704|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_346.wav|||We are working so hard.|
041705|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_347.wav|||One was a lawyer.|
041706|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_348.wav|||Our position is extremely simple.|
041707|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_349.wav|||Where did that finish?|
041708|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_350.wav|||I suppose it is quite exciting really.|
041709|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_351.wav|||The most important thing was to win today.|
041710|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_352.wav|||Golf is not like that.|
041711|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_353.wav|||This is a moment to seize.|
041712|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_354.wav|||I would not do that.|
041713|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_355.wav|||Lots of them haven't recovered that far.|
041714|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_356.wav|||They said that they stood by their statement.|
041715|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_357.wav|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
041716|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_358.wav|||That has to be allowed.|
041717|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_359.wav|||He has never let them down.|
041718|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_360.wav|||There was no-one of the required standard.|
041719|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_361.wav|||That would be very good for Rangers.|
041720|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_362.wav|||It's something he has worked very hard on.|
041721|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_363.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
041722|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_364.wav|||That gives it a spirit.|
041723|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_365.wav|||She has never been back.|
041724|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_366.wav|||It will set the tone.|
041725|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_367.wav|||They are not going away.|
041726|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_368.wav|||Having done it, he was asked again.|
041727|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_369.wav|||I think he will.|
041728|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_370.wav|||The package is a changing one.|
041729|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_371.wav|||I'm working on that one, too.|
041730|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_372.wav|||Frankly, that's not good enough.|
041731|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_373.wav|||Or is it?|
041732|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_374.wav|||What's the difference?|
041733|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_375.wav|||The whole family was in shock.|
041734|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_376.wav|||But everywhere the problems are the same.|
041735|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_377.wav|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
041736|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_378.wav|||The problems began a long time ago.|
041737|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_379.wav|||It meant a lot to us.|
041738|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_380.wav|||What other retailer would do this?|
041739|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_381.wav|||Other musicians were found in retirement.|
041740|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_382.wav|||This country has many challenges.|
041741|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_383.wav|||Their families are gone.|
041742|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_384.wav|||IS Tony Blair on drugs?|
041743|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_385.wav|||I didn't do it.|
041744|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_386.wav|||They are with their father.|
041745|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_387.wav|||They're all doing it.|
041746|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_388.wav|||I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|
041747|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_389.wav|||No, they are not the same thing.|
041748|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_390.wav|||In football it is not always the case.|
041749|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_391.wav|||Sometimes we find a person.|
041750|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_392.wav|||It is a natural reaction.|
041751|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_393.wav|||I am in a very difficult position.|
041752|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_394.wav|||I had to win this race.|
041753|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_395.wav|||They could have been told in advance.|
041754|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_396.wav|||And what do we have?|
041755|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_397.wav|||It is a relief.|
041756|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_398.wav|||The boat was fantastic.|
041757|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_399.wav|||These were the edited highlights.|
041758|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_400.wav|||That is the difference.|
041759|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_401.wav|||You will need it.|
041760|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_402.wav|||There is so much at stake.|
041761|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_403.wav|||It has great potential.|
041762|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_404.wav|||They had three children.|
041763|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_405.wav|||It was all too little, too late.|
041764|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_406.wav|||Still, it is a very good result for us.|
041765|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_407.wav|||And he's not alone.|
041766|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_408.wav|||What was all that about?|
041767|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_409.wav|||What's the problem with change?|
041768|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_410.wav|||I intend to end it on a high.|
041769|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_411.wav|||What she can't have is the money.|
041770|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_412.wav|||I thought they played well.|
041771|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_413.wav|||This is not the end.|
041772|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_414.wav|||And they went on to win the title.|
041773|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_415.wav|||Now, she will not be running at all.|
041774|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_416.wav|||It's not an impression.|
041775|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_417.wav|||This was great for our sport.|
041776|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_418.wav|||There's no place to hide.|
041777|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_419.wav|||I don't think they are too serious.|
041778|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_420.wav|||Tiger is the exception.|
041779|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_421.wav|||There was no happy ending.|
041780|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_422.wav|||They need time to think.|
041781|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_423.wav|||It's unfair on her.|
041782|en-360-m|en|wav/p360_424.wav|||As for Owen, class is permanent.|
041783|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
041784|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
041785|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041786|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041787|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041788|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041789|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041790|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041791|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041792|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041793|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041794|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041795|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041796|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041797|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041798|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041799|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041800|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041801|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041802|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041803|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041804|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041805|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041806|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041807|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_025.wav|||Something has to be done.|
041808|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_026.wav|||That is where the damage has been done.|
041809|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_027.wav|||He may not need to force that message.|
041810|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_028.wav|||These decisions are not simple.|
041811|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_029.wav|||The results were very clear.|
041812|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_030.wav|||We must convince the citizens.|
041813|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_031.wav|||I decided it is going to be William.|
041814|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_032.wav|||But we need to keep it there.|
041815|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_033.wav|||It is a case of taking a risk.|
041816|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_034.wav|||I am really ready for it now.|
041817|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_035.wav|||He was jailed for four years.|
041818|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_036.wav|||We felt it was sufficient.|
041819|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_037.wav|||This decision is folly.|
041820|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_038.wav|||And this was well known?|
041821|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_039.wav|||It took two minutes to respond.|
041822|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_040.wav|||Why you did it will never be known.|
041823|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_041.wav|||He was in his element.|
041824|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_042.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
041825|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_043.wav|||So, we have to go back.|
041826|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_044.wav|||I'm sure he does.|
041827|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_045.wav|||He was found again almost a year later.|
041828|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_046.wav|||The answer was wrong.|
041829|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_047.wav|||They need to be helped.|
041830|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_048.wav|||It is all starting to come together.|
041831|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_049.wav|||I am the fastest player on the course.|
041832|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_050.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
041833|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_051.wav|||They were taken to prove a point.|
041834|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_052.wav|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
041835|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_053.wav|||It is an important step forward.|
041836|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_054.wav|||A final agreement has not yet been completed.|
041837|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_055.wav|||And they removed a Borderer.|
041838|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_056.wav|||That is the way it is.|
041839|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_057.wav|||That was something else.|
041840|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_058.wav|||This resulted in the following.|
041841|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_059.wav|||I want to deal with this stuff.|
041842|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_060.wav|||We will be patient but we will win.|
041843|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_061.wav|||As good as they come.|
041844|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_062.wav|||It is not for me to say.|
041845|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_063.wav|||For that much we must be grateful.|
041846|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_064.wav|||But the law is very clear on this.|
041847|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_065.wav|||I thought it was quite a positive result.|
041848|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_066.wav|||But we are very near.|
041849|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_067.wav|||Nobody else is at risk.|
041850|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_068.wav|||We are not going to back off.|
041851|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_069.wav|||He said it was for sale.|
041852|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_070.wav|||We have a strong team at the moment.|
041853|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_071.wav|||This is a dream come true.|
041854|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_072.wav|||The problem is not confined to the UK.|
041855|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_073.wav|||It is on the news.|
041856|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_074.wav|||They said there was nothing.|
041857|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_075.wav|||They were looking for things.|
041858|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_076.wav|||I've got to be better than that   Quite.|
041859|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_077.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
041860|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_078.wav|||As it should be.|
041861|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_079.wav|||We have never been short of volunteers.|
041862|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_080.wav|||But who is it?|
041863|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_081.wav|||Kenny Miller might come through.|
041864|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_082.wav|||Workers will now be balloted on the offer.|
041865|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_083.wav|||It just isn't there.|
041866|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_084.wav|||Drama is not one of them.|
041867|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_085.wav|||And we have a singer.|
041868|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_086.wav|||It was exactly four months away.|
041869|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_087.wav|||This is a personal decision for me.|
041870|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_088.wav|||It's just a failing service.|
041871|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_089.wav|||We all want to be left alone.|
041872|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_090.wav|||I was saying, No.|
041873|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_091.wav|||Where are they?|
041874|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_092.wav|||I am delighted to hear this news.|
041875|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_093.wav|||I knew him a little.|
041876|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_094.wav|||They just have a go.|
041877|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_095.wav|||If it's going in, it goes in.|
041878|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_096.wav|||Nobody called me to explain.|
041879|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_097.wav|||You didn't get a modified.|
041880|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_098.wav|||What kind of person is he?|
041881|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_099.wav|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
041882|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_100.wav|||What has changed since then?|
041883|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_101.wav|||He knows he is good.|
041884|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_102.wav|||I welcome the decision.|
041885|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_103.wav|||It could take some time.|
041886|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_104.wav|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
041887|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_105.wav|||It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|
041888|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_106.wav|||I've done a lot in that building.|
041889|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_107.wav|||Music is all consuming.|
041890|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_108.wav|||The results are very positive.|
041891|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_109.wav|||Talk of a crisis is absurd.|
041892|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_110.wav|||Which is where we come in.|
041893|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_111.wav|||I'm not looking forward to it.|
041894|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_112.wav|||Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.|
041895|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_113.wav|||He is a pro.|
041896|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_114.wav|||They have to tell it as it is.|
041897|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_115.wav|||This could easily have been another tragedy.|
041898|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_116.wav|||You should enjoy the day.|
041899|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_117.wav|||He was taken ill in his office.|
041900|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_118.wav|||We couldn't get enough of it.|
041901|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_119.wav|||Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|
041902|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_120.wav|||I am not very pleased.|
041903|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_121.wav|||It is just a statement of fact.|
041904|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_122.wav|||It was on my mind a little bit.|
041905|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_123.wav|||I will just have to be patient.|
041906|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_124.wav|||I didn't think about it again.|
041907|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_125.wav|||And if they fail?|
041908|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
041909|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_127.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
041910|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_128.wav|||We've always had something to do.|
041911|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_129.wav|||How do you take them away?|
041912|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_130.wav|||It will be released in October.|
041913|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_132.wav|||That got me out.|
041914|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_133.wav|||IT is called a killing in the trade.|
041915|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_134.wav|||It's a matter for the Committee.|
041916|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_135.wav|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
041917|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_136.wav|||I've never seen anything like it.|
041918|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_137.wav|||It was highly successful.|
041919|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_138.wav|||We needed someone and we now have him.|
041920|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_139.wav|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
041921|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_140.wav|||Only one was from Glasgow.|
041922|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_141.wav|||I'm sure he will be aware of it.|
041923|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_142.wav|||Until you hit the big games.|
041924|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_143.wav|||They received no money under the merger.|
041925|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_144.wav|||It was a big departure.|
041926|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_145.wav|||She has never mentioned it.|
041927|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_146.wav|||I want my mum.|
041928|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_147.wav|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
041929|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_148.wav|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
041930|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_149.wav|||There are no second chances.|
041931|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_150.wav|||And it was great for me.|
041932|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_151.wav|||I am extremely sad.|
041933|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_152.wav|||This series is for real.|
041934|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_153.wav|||It has still to be recovered.|
041935|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_154.wav|||The conclusion is the same.|
041936|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_155.wav|||I wish they would commit to us.|
041937|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_156.wav|||The driver just insulted me.|
041938|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_157.wav|||Something has to be put in place.|
041939|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_158.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
041940|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_159.wav|||It's a mixture of everything.|
041941|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_160.wav|||That is the sensible outcome.|
041942|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_161.wav|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
041943|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_162.wav|||This means a lot of hard decisions.|
041944|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_163.wav|||That comes at a cost.|
041945|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_164.wav|||And so did the rest of her team.|
041946|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_165.wav|||He tells the truth and that's important.|
041947|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_166.wav|||Those are difficult decisions.|
041948|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_167.wav|||The omens are not good.|
041949|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_168.wav|||The game was there to be won.|
041950|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_169.wav|||Then there's the casting.|
041951|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_170.wav|||There is no signature.|
041952|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_171.wav|||We can't go on like this.|
041953|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_172.wav|||It is a very demanding course.|
041954|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_173.wav|||Can he do it?|
041955|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_174.wav|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
041956|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_175.wav|||I've won the British.|
041957|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_176.wav|||If they wish to go, they can go.|
041958|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_177.wav|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
041959|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_178.wav|||I was just aghast.|
041960|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_179.wav|||They get money for it now.|
041961|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_180.wav|||I could have been offended.|
041962|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_181.wav|||That's not the way to think.|
041963|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_182.wav|||I can see it now.|
041964|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_183.wav|||Then everyone must consider their future.|
041965|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_184.wav|||There was nothing she could do.|
041966|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_185.wav|||We want to be part of it.|
041967|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_186.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
041968|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_187.wav|||It's not long enough.|
041969|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_188.wav|||This is positive and welcome.|
041970|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_189.wav|||Now he is back on top again.|
041971|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_190.wav|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
041972|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_191.wav|||Anything less will not do.|
041973|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_192.wav|||Failure is not an option.|
041974|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_193.wav|||That is clearly not happening fast enough.|
041975|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_194.wav|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
041976|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_195.wav|||You look at that.|
041977|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_196.wav|||They will be very physical.|
041978|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_197.wav|||It has been well worth it.|
041979|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_198.wav|||It was just a feeling.|
041980|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_199.wav|||People are trying to run away.|
041981|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_200.wav|||On the face of it, this is excellent news.|
041982|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_201.wav|||This is clearly not abuse.|
041983|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_202.wav|||He should be careful.|
041984|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_203.wav|||Everyone knew the family.|
041985|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_204.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
041986|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_205.wav|||Translation - we got it wrong.|
041987|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_206.wav|||We will be working on that this week, all right.|
041988|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_207.wav|||These are serious matters.|
041989|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_208.wav|||The pace is telling.|
041990|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_209.wav|||She has always been very friendly.|
041991|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_210.wav|||Their loss is heartbreaking.|
041992|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_211.wav|||It is his script.|
041993|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_212.wav|||I am a socialist.|
041994|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_213.wav|||The response was really good.|
041995|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_214.wav|||The squad is too small.|
041996|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_215.wav|||You can blame the defence.|
041997|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_216.wav|||Usually the enjoyment is two ways.|
041998|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_217.wav|||It just could be a good night.|
041999|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_218.wav|||But we were wrong.|
042000|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_219.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
042001|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_220.wav|||It is an outrage.|
042002|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_221.wav|||It is a performance.|
042003|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_222.wav|||It is the best place.|
042004|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_223.wav|||We tried to get them down.|
042005|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_224.wav|||There were other problems for Brown yesterday.|
042006|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_225.wav|||I don't know the full story.|
042007|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_226.wav|||Part-time staff are being laid off.|
042008|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_227.wav|||Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|
042009|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_228.wav|||But they have taken the lesson to heart.|
042010|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_229.wav|||I just want him to win a tournament.|
042011|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_230.wav|||Eight others are also believed to have died.|
042012|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_231.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
042013|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_232.wav|||I will never see my son again.|
042014|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_233.wav|||But it is being pursued.|
042015|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_234.wav|||He knew they were there.|
042016|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_235.wav|||That would end it for us.|
042017|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_236.wav|||We didn't and it cost us the game.|
042018|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_237.wav|||It attracted no complaints.|
042019|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_238.wav|||Neil is never going to come back.|
042020|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_239.wav|||The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|
042021|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_240.wav|||Four of the victims were women.|
042022|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_241.wav|||He was also very happy to listen.|
042023|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_242.wav|||It's to do with this place.|
042024|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_243.wav|||It's a technical demand.|
042025|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_244.wav|||Sadly it is a mess.|
042026|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_245.wav|||That has to take its toll.|
042027|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_246.wav|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
042028|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_247.wav|||But those days are dead and gone.|
042029|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_248.wav|||However we must not be complacent.|
042030|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_249.wav|||And that was just the start.|
042031|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_250.wav|||Nothing was meant by it.|
042032|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_251.wav|||That was my last game.|
042033|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_252.wav|||Colour is another problem.|
042034|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_253.wav|||It is not just the agencies.|
042035|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_254.wav|||It came in bits and pieces.|
042036|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_255.wav|||You don't see that.|
042037|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_256.wav|||They seem to be, anyway.|
042038|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_257.wav|||I thought they were just excited.|
042039|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_258.wav|||He will appear in court today.|
042040|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_259.wav|||Or is he?|
042041|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_260.wav|||Was he confident about his prospects?|
042042|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_261.wav|||What can you do?|
042043|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_262.wav|||It's been very difficult.|
042044|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_263.wav|||Do something that we need.|
042045|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_264.wav|||There is no other offer on the table.|
042046|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_265.wav|||When she returned, it was a wreck.|
042047|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_266.wav|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
042048|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_267.wav|||It is difficult to say.|
042049|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_268.wav|||He is not the only one.|
042050|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_269.wav|||We call it marriage.|
042051|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_270.wav|||Full back was a bit of the unknown.|
042052|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_271.wav|||It's not the tour.|
042053|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_272.wav|||So what is the secret of the success?|
042054|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_273.wav|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
042055|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_274.wav|||So was the first half.|
042056|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_275.wav|||It is still under discussion with the board.|
042057|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_276.wav|||That is one point of view.|
042058|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_277.wav|||We are in this for the long haul.|
042059|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_278.wav|||Here we go then.|
042060|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_279.wav|||No reason was given.|
042061|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_280.wav|||I can't wait for it to come out.|
042062|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_281.wav|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
042063|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_282.wav|||Indeed, that has already begun.|
042064|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_283.wav|||But it's the truth.|
042065|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_284.wav|||We have been here before.|
042066|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_285.wav|||And he did that.|
042067|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_286.wav|||And she is very clear on this.|
042068|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_287.wav|||His remarks were disgraceful.|
042069|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_288.wav|||I did not think it was very proper.|
042070|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_289.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
042071|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_290.wav|||In a way he was.|
042072|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_291.wav|||I will never forget that.|
042073|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_292.wav|||It was considered to be topical.|
042074|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_293.wav|||Well, that's all right then.|
042075|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_294.wav|||No-one is a winner in this.|
042076|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_295.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
042077|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_296.wav|||What do you think?|
042078|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_297.wav|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
042079|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_298.wav|||If we don't do it, someone else will.|
042080|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_299.wav|||Again, there was no detail.|
042081|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_300.wav|||Let the voters decide.|
042082|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_301.wav|||Then it will come.|
042083|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_302.wav|||It should be easy.|
042084|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
042085|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_304.wav|||I will build a house on the site.|
042086|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_305.wav|||We are right at the heart of Europe.|
042087|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_306.wav|||I do my job.|
042088|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_307.wav|||They have to get that sorted.|
042089|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_308.wav|||That is a dangerous assumption.|
042090|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_309.wav|||Does it make a profit?|
042091|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_310.wav|||I think it's a good sign.|
042092|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_311.wav|||A winter of discontent awaits.|
042093|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_312.wav|||I knew him well.|
042094|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_313.wav|||I am not ready to walk away.|
042095|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_314.wav|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
042096|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_315.wav|||They are already there.|
042097|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_316.wav|||I'd never given up on myself.|
042098|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_317.wav|||The concerns were unfounded.|
042099|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_318.wav|||It doesn't look good for her.|
042100|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_319.wav|||It was a management problem in the hospital.|
042101|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_320.wav|||I have some comments.|
042102|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_321.wav|||You have to be realistic.|
042103|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_322.wav|||There was nowhere for him to go.|
042104|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_323.wav|||Not that he was complaining.|
042105|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_324.wav|||We are very proud of him.|
042106|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_325.wav|||There they were, making excuses for him.|
042107|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_326.wav|||It just got out of control.|
042108|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_327.wav|||Every case is completely different.|
042109|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_328.wav|||It's all about unfinished business.|
042110|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_329.wav|||Our own people are coming over on Friday.|
042111|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_330.wav|||In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|
042112|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_331.wav|||It will be fine.|
042113|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_332.wav|||Yet the job is far from over.|
042114|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_333.wav|||He has a point.|
042115|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_334.wav|||He should emerge as the winner.|
042116|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_335.wav|||It is our other home.|
042117|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_336.wav|||When you think you cannot go on, you can.|
042118|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_337.wav|||What a difference a game can make.|
042119|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_338.wav|||It is their day.|
042120|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_339.wav|||They are a very good side, without a doubt.|
042121|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_340.wav|||They are used to it.|
042122|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_341.wav|||And we are doing it.|
042123|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_342.wav|||It's just not good enough.|
042124|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_343.wav|||I have a cold.|
042125|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_344.wav|||You've got to hand it to them.|
042126|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_345.wav|||Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.|
042127|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_346.wav|||It was his own decision.|
042128|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_347.wav|||This is still happening in the US.|
042129|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_348.wav|||And that was the real problem.|
042130|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_349.wav|||But then the problems began.|
042131|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_350.wav|||It wasn't about her singing, though.|
042132|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_351.wav|||From the opening Could It Be Magic?|
042133|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_352.wav|||The duties are still to be drawn up.|
042134|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_353.wav|||That there would be discussions.|
042135|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_354.wav|||It must not happen.|
042136|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_355.wav|||That would be unsafe.|
042137|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_356.wav|||I did not go looking anywhere else.|
042138|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_357.wav|||We had no idea what was going on.|
042139|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_358.wav|||If only it had been.|
042140|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_359.wav|||So far, it is no more.|
042141|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_360.wav|||Seven people were critically injured.|
042142|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_361.wav|||I am very sorry to be here.|
042143|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_362.wav|||He could have given them a lot.|
042144|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_363.wav|||It was up to him.|
042145|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_364.wav|||It's going to happen.|
042146|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_365.wav|||I don't think so.|
042147|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_366.wav|||And that was just about that.|
042148|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_367.wav|||By hard work, is the answer.|
042149|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_368.wav|||It is really special to me.|
042150|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_369.wav|||This is a major step forward.|
042151|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_370.wav|||They haven't got the uniform.|
042152|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_371.wav|||Well, you don't have time.|
042153|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_372.wav|||It is very funny.|
042154|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_373.wav|||I just hope it's not tonight against us.|
042155|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_374.wav|||This is good news for the industry.|
042156|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_375.wav|||There are no quick fixes.|
042157|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_376.wav|||Because they didn't want to know.|
042158|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_377.wav|||What do we have to do?|
042159|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_378.wav|||I have never seen anything like it.|
042160|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_379.wav|||It's about New Yorkers.|
042161|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_380.wav|||That was a real challenge.|
042162|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_381.wav|||They will give it a couple of years.|
042163|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_382.wav|||He certainly would have approved.|
042164|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_383.wav|||Conditions were less than ideal.|
042165|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_384.wav|||We want this place to work.|
042166|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_385.wav|||Father is on the train.|
042167|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_386.wav|||It could have been prevented.|
042168|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_387.wav|||We have been going for three years.|
042169|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_388.wav|||Firstly, we don't know we can do this.|
042170|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_389.wav|||I think it was entirely the right decision.|
042171|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_390.wav|||It is planned for London in the spring.|
042172|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_391.wav|||Everything is coming together well.|
042173|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_392.wav|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
042174|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_393.wav|||But we are not afraid of them.|
042175|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_394.wav|||It didn't matter who was in their way.|
042176|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_395.wav|||That will be the criteria for the future.|
042177|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_396.wav|||They thought they couldn't get any.|
042178|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_397.wav|||He was too good for me - too consistent.|
042179|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_398.wav|||I am delighted to have her back home.|
042180|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_399.wav|||This idea is a good starting point.|
042181|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_400.wav|||She had denied the charge.|
042182|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_401.wav|||It was cynical and callous.|
042183|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_402.wav|||It's a dead end.|
042184|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_403.wav|||What sort of man is that?|
042185|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_404.wav|||The message was clear.|
042186|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_405.wav|||We are going nowhere.|
042187|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_406.wav|||It is truly masterly performance.|
042188|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_407.wav|||She failed to win any of them.|
042189|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_408.wav|||It is believed he had been stabbed.|
042190|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_409.wav|||Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|
042191|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_410.wav|||It has a rally instead of a conference.|
042192|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_411.wav|||I found that we couldn't.|
042193|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_412.wav|||He is very sensitive.|
042194|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_413.wav|||That can benefit the larger companies.|
042195|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_414.wav|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
042196|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_415.wav|||We told them in July.|
042197|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_416.wav|||This was a very tragic accident.|
042198|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_417.wav|||We are very, very confident.|
042199|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_418.wav|||It is a result we should savour.|
042200|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_419.wav|||Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|
042201|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_420.wav|||We certainly do not intend to disband.|
042202|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_421.wav|||My life is going to go on.|
042203|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_422.wav|||It's really part of our mission.|
042204|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_423.wav|||That was only the start.|
042205|en-361-f|en|wav/p361_424.wav|||But what took them so long?|
042206|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
042207|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042208|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042209|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042210|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042211|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042212|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042213|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042214|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042215|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042216|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042217|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042218|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042219|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042220|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042221|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042222|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042223|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

042423|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_219.wav|||This plan is an agenda for action.|
042424|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_220.wav|||It was all relative.|
042425|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_221.wav|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
042426|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_222.wav|||Are you up for business?|
042427|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_223.wav|||It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|
042428|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_224.wav|||You are not in any kind of trouble.|
042429|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_225.wav|||It also makes for interesting viewing.|
042430|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_226.wav|||Life becomes a song.|
042431|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_227.wav|||No wonder he missed the conversion.|
042432|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_228.wav|||Sadly, they did not.|
042433|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_229.wav|||We have nowhere to go.|
042434|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_230.wav|||He has every right to do that.|
042435|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_231.wav|||Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|
042436|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_232.wav|||That had never happened.|
042437|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_233.wav|||However, our players will fight for that.|
042438|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_234.wav|||They are not suitable.|
042439|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_235.wav|||He is advised that he has done so.|
042440|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_236.wav|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
042441|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_237.wav|||He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|
042442|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_238.wav|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
042443|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_239.wav|||But the killing will continue.|
042444|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_240.wav|||They've got to get better.|
042445|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_241.wav|||But we are working together for this result.|
042446|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_242.wav|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
042447|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_243.wav|||It doesn't make them evil.|
042448|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_244.wav|||We don't want to be too intrusive.|
042449|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_245.wav|||The most important thing is the game.|
042450|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_246.wav|||He said nothing of the sort.|
042451|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_247.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
042452|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_248.wav|||In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|
042453|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_249.wav|||The door is open.|
042454|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_250.wav|||Pulled a huge number of viewers.|
042455|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_251.wav|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
042456|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_252.wav|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
042457|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_253.wav|||So what went wrong?|
042458|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_254.wav|||We did not play well.|
042459|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_255.wav|||We are in a very strong position.|
042460|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_256.wav|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
042461|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_257.wav|||That is the key.|
042462|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_258.wav|||So, how did you do?|
042463|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_259.wav|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
042464|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_260.wav|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
042465|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_261.wav|||I can't deny that fact.|
042466|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_262.wav|||She is now planning a visit.|
042467|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_263.wav|||We could have done without this.|
042468|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_264.wav|||Boy is the town a mess.|
042469|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_265.wav|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
042470|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_266.wav|||He's a great dealer.|
042471|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_267.wav|||Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|
042472|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_268.wav|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
042473|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_269.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
042474|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_270.wav|||We are moving on.|
042475|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_271.wav|||This is not a crisis.|
042476|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_272.wav|||There's always a chance.|
042477|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_273.wav|||I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|
042478|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_274.wav|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
042479|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_275.wav|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
042480|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_276.wav|||That's a very serious matter.|
042481|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_277.wav|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
042482|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_278.wav|||But it was to no avail.|
042483|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_279.wav|||Sad to say, it's still waiting.|
042484|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_280.wav|||It has been a major success.|
042485|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_281.wav|||It takes a bit of working out.|
042486|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_282.wav|||I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|
042487|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_283.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
042488|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_284.wav|||I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|
042489|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_285.wav|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
042490|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_286.wav|||He will not be coming back.|
042491|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_287.wav|||He is also a great finisher.|
042492|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_288.wav|||I don't see any problem.|
042493|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_289.wav|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
042494|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_290.wav|||Yet it seemed to work.|
042495|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_291.wav|||Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|
042496|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_292.wav|||I have never felt so well.|
042497|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_293.wav|||There are other things going on.|
042498|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_294.wav|||All is now forgiven.|
042499|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_295.wav|||So who is right?|
042500|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_296.wav|||And this tournament will travel.|
042501|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_297.wav|||There will be new memories.|
042502|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_298.wav|||Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|
042503|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_299.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
042504|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_300.wav|||How can they get one?|
042505|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_301.wav|||It was an insult.|
042506|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_302.wav|||But we all have to look at ourselves.|
042507|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_303.wav|||We have nothing to hide.|
042508|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_304.wav|||He added, We are full of anger.|
042509|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_305.wav|||He did it all for us.|
042510|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_306.wav|||I don't think that is good enough.|
042511|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_307.wav|||Of course it is.|
042512|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_308.wav|||We all make mistakes.|
042513|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_309.wav|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
042514|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_310.wav|||That is my commitment.|
042515|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_311.wav|||This is the only problem with the story.|
042516|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_312.wav|||It is good football in Scotland.|
042517|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_313.wav|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
042518|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_314.wav|||Is that right?|
042519|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_315.wav|||So other options had to be explored.|
042520|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_316.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
042521|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_317.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
042522|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_318.wav|||It is good news for us.|
042523|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_319.wav|||The timing is obvious.|
042524|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_320.wav|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
042525|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_321.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
042526|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_322.wav|||I don't think it's very real.|
042527|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_323.wav|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
042528|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_324.wav|||I think she was right.|
042529|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_325.wav|||Is that what people want?|
042530|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_326.wav|||CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|
042531|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_327.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
042532|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_328.wav|||It will be a new experience.|
042533|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_329.wav|||The process itself has taken over.|
042534|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_330.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
042535|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_331.wav|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
042536|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_332.wav|||It is quite hard to track.|
042537|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_333.wav|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042538|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_334.wav|||But his attendance is not guaranteed.|
042539|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_335.wav|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
042540|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_336.wav|||I am sure all schools would accept that.|
042541|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_337.wav|||It was quite an ordeal for them.|
042542|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_338.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
042543|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_339.wav|||Doesn't matter what you do.|
042544|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_340.wav|||O no it's not!|
042545|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_341.wav|||The result could be all down to turnout.|
042546|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_342.wav|||They are in good spirits.|
042547|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_343.wav|||Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|
042548|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_344.wav|||He was their leader.|
042549|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_345.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
042550|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_346.wav|||So far he has not done so.|
042551|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_347.wav|||Maybe they will show it next year.|
042552|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_348.wav|||They are a very good team.|
042553|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_349.wav|||So there we are.|
042554|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_350.wav|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
042555|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_351.wav|||It doesn't make me feel any better.|
042556|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_352.wav|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
042557|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_353.wav|||The incident is dead.|
042558|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_354.wav|||We are delighted with the result.|
042559|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_355.wav|||It will take time.|
042560|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_356.wav|||They will do something big.|
042561|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_357.wav|||The programme was awful.|
042562|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_358.wav|||It is having a big impact.|
042563|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_359.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
042564|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_360.wav|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042565|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_361.wav|||Doesn't he miss it?|
042566|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_362.wav|||The same goes for Russia.|
042567|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_363.wav|||They went down together.|
042568|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_364.wav|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
042569|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_365.wav|||One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|
042570|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_366.wav|||We were getting very worried.|
042571|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_367.wav|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
042572|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_368.wav|||You can't really compare.|
042573|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_369.wav|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
042574|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_370.wav|||Plot is not the issue.|
042575|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_371.wav|||We need to increase the membership.|
042576|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_372.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
042577|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_373.wav|||We should not be complacent.|
042578|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_374.wav|||We all want the same things.|
042579|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_375.wav|||Maybe his time has gone.|
042580|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_376.wav|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
042581|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_377.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
042582|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_378.wav|||SO, that is it for another year.|
042583|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_379.wav|||The results are tragic.|
042584|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_380.wav|||We are not getting him back.|
042585|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_381.wav|||He was on a horse.|
042586|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_382.wav|||Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
042587|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_383.wav|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
042588|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_384.wav|||There may be reasons for it.|
042589|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_385.wav|||He had taken everything from me.|
042590|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_386.wav|||It's a good offer by any standards.|
042591|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_387.wav|||Yes, it took time to recover.|
042592|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_388.wav|||The potential is always in the idea.|
042593|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_389.wav|||I am not a frustrated actor.|
042594|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_390.wav|||No progress has been made.|
042595|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_391.wav|||He can win every week.|
042596|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_392.wav|||This makes up for it.|
042597|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_393.wav|||My mind was made up.|
042598|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_394.wav|||The plot is changing as time goes on.|
042599|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_395.wav|||I never got anything out of it.|
042600|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_396.wav|||It is patently true.|
042601|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_397.wav|||Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|
042602|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_398.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
042603|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_399.wav|||That is why he is so special.|
042604|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_400.wav|||You hope he prevails.|
042605|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_401.wav|||My mother was getting on at me.|
042606|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_402.wav|||This is a very serious matter.|
042607|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_403.wav|||It's going to be great!|
042608|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_404.wav|||That's a good sign.|
042609|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_405.wav|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
042610|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_406.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
042611|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_407.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
042612|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_408.wav|||He declined to be more specific.|
042613|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_409.wav|||But it looks good for next year.|
042614|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_410.wav|||Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|
042615|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_411.wav|||We want everyone to have a good time.|
042616|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_412.wav|||We're going to rebuild.|
042617|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_413.wav|||We are trying to do it properly.|
042618|en-362-f|en|wav/p362_414.wav|||We actually had a laugh about that.|
