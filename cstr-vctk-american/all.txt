025681|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
025682|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
025683|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
025684|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
025685|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
025686|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
025687|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
025688|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
025689|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
025690|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
025691|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
025692|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
025693|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
025694|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
025695|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
025696|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
025697|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
025698|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
025699|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
025700|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
025701|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
025702|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025703|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
025704|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
025705|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_025.wav|||They were the better team on the night.|
025706|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_026.wav|||The show is sold out, like the others in the run.|
025707|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_027.wav|||It means we have to have some patience.|
025708|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_028.wav|||For the moment, our position remains the same.|
025709|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_029.wav|||I was pregnant and very worried.|
025710|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_030.wav|||He said she was mad.|
025711|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_031.wav|||They were impressive against France.|
025712|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_032.wav|||I am delighted at Murray's appointment.|
025713|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_033.wav|||The airport was even different.|
025714|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_034.wav|||Other people had looked at it.|
025715|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_035.wav|||A neighbour said the street was shocked.|
025716|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_036.wav|||Michael, he is running!|
025717|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_037.wav|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
025718|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_038.wav|||Their ambition is to go back.|
025719|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_039.wav|||He got the same story.|
025720|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_040.wav|||My view has now changed completely.|
025721|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_041.wav|||I've been dying for an hour.|
025722|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_042.wav|||It wasn't a flight of fancy.|
025723|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_043.wav|||We're playing away from home and that's it.|
025724|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_044.wav|||I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|
025725|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_045.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
025726|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_046.wav|||Who was the mystery MP?|
025727|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_047.wav|||This was no accident.|
025728|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_048.wav|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
025729|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_049.wav|||We've all done it!|
025730|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_050.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
025731|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_051.wav|||Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.|
025732|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_052.wav|||The course record was in his name.|
025733|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_053.wav|||But we welcome this document.|
025734|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_054.wav|||What is the point of jailing him?|
025735|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_055.wav|||We should not bring him into a dispute.|
025736|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_056.wav|||This is a possible way forward.|
025737|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_057.wav|||I am not here to get even.|
025738|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_058.wav|||Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|
025739|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_059.wav|||We are only human.|
025740|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_060.wav|||I went with the mood.|
025741|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_061.wav|||I think we'll just keep it.|
025742|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_062.wav|||Debate is not just talk.|
025743|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_063.wav|||How is he enjoying life as a senior?|
025744|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_064.wav|||It is all about having physical evidence.|
025745|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_065.wav|||People remember the Tories in office.|
025746|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_066.wav|||What kind of inclusion is that?|
025747|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_067.wav|||I fell in love with it right away.|
025748|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_068.wav|||Domestic abuse is related to power and control.|
025749|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_069.wav|||It makes for an interesting conference.|
025750|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_070.wav|||I don't have any answer for them.|
025751|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_071.wav|||It took about five or six hours.|
025752|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_072.wav|||I found the course inspiring.|
025753|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_073.wav|||Two things were clear from the new programme.|
025754|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_074.wav|||This is the real thing now.|
025755|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_075.wav|||Until they came to do it.|
025756|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_076.wav|||She now lives in London.|
025757|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_077.wav|||It will not be a long campaign.|
025758|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_078.wav|||Subs not used, McGraw.|
025759|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_079.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
025760|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_080.wav|||One policeman was killed.|
025761|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_081.wav|||They could not have done more for me.|
025762|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_082.wav|||It was like a vacuum.|
025763|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_083.wav|||That was enough for the committee.|
025764|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_084.wav|||It is a very genuine prospect.|
025765|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_085.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
025766|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_086.wav|||We have to focus on what is important.|
025767|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_087.wav|||They have to work so hard.|
025768|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_088.wav|||It's not very pretty, but it's effective.|
025769|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_089.wav|||Seven British members of the club are missing.|
025770|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_090.wav|||He had just returned from a run.|
025771|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_091.wav|||There's a strong involvement.|
025772|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_092.wav|||Now, though, he has an incentive.|
025773|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_093.wav|||But now it's back to golf.|
025774|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_094.wav|||It should be a condition of employment.|
025775|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_095.wav|||Was it a signal?|
025776|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_096.wav|||It may not even be possible.|
025777|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_097.wav|||In fact, they go hand in hand.|
025778|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_098.wav|||I gave him a way out, and he took it.|
025779|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_099.wav|||So is that it, then?|
025780|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_100.wav|||You should have let it write the cards.|
025781|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_101.wav|||It's annoying in a way.|
025782|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_102.wav|||It's too close to call.|
025783|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_103.wav|||It's a long process.|
025784|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_104.wav|||I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|
025785|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_105.wav|||Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|
025786|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_106.wav|||The other conditions were not specified.|
025787|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_107.wav|||I've never felt affection for Emu.|
025788|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_108.wav|||That's not part of the deal.|
025789|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_109.wav|||That was the context of his remarks.|
025790|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_110.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
025791|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_111.wav|||We have great confidence in Derek.|
025792|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_112.wav|||My ambition is to tell a good story.|
025793|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_113.wav|||I don't know the nature of the illness.|
025794|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_114.wav|||The industry will try to get round it.|
025795|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_115.wav|||Who will deliver more service to Scotland?|
025796|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_116.wav|||I want to make a vigorous defence.|
025797|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_117.wav|||And she got it.|
025798|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_118.wav|||We are the weakest link.|
025799|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_119.wav|||We have now no choice.|
025800|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_120.wav|||My father and mother are.|
025801|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_121.wav|||We don't know what happened after.|
025802|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_122.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
025803|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_123.wav|||He seems to be used to the attention.|
025804|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_124.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
025805|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_125.wav|||We have very real concerns about it.|
025806|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
025807|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_127.wav|||People will see this over time.|
025808|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_128.wav|||I can't speak for him.|
025809|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_129.wav|||They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|
025810|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_130.wav|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
025811|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_131.wav|||I can't see him reversing that.|
025812|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_132.wav|||I'm deeply sorry they did.|
025813|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_133.wav|||I can lead by example.|
025814|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_134.wav|||I have had a wonderful career.|
025815|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_135.wav|||It seemed to have direction.|
025816|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_136.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|
025817|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_137.wav|||It was different in the endurance events.|
025818|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_138.wav|||Above all, the approach is upbeat.|
025819|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_139.wav|||The objective was achieved.|
025820|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_140.wav|||It was a hugely popular decision.|
025821|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_141.wav|||He invented the language.|
025822|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_142.wav|||Where are they?|
025823|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_143.wav|||It's hard not to.|
025824|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_144.wav|||It is a question of life and death.|
025825|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_145.wav|||However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.|
025826|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_146.wav|||You ask the question.|
025827|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_147.wav|||She was always a quality act.|
025828|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_148.wav|||We are all very proud of her.|
025829|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_149.wav|||I'm sure that is not.|
025830|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_150.wav|||It's a great idea.|
025831|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_151.wav|||It's like a score in some ways.|
025832|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_152.wav|||It's a wonderful piece of water.|
025833|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_153.wav|||Feel the air, the space.|
025834|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_154.wav|||Therein lies the problem.|
025835|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_155.wav|||You feel the pride.|
025836|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_156.wav|||We are well insured.|
025837|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_157.wav|||I was quietly confident about getting the win.|
025838|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_158.wav|||The Treasury denied the claims.|
025839|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_159.wav|||You've been working for four years.|
025840|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_160.wav|||I am the Son of Sam.|
025841|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_161.wav|||There is no shortage of commitment.|
025842|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_162.wav|||Such as it is.|
025843|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_163.wav|||He deserves a second chance.|
025844|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_164.wav|||He also admitted.|
025845|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_165.wav|||There was no change in the strategy.|
025846|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_166.wav|||There's been a mistake.|
025847|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_167.wav|||It had until tomorrow to comply.|
025848|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_168.wav|||Genetic assessment is crucial.|
025849|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_169.wav|||I enjoy my work.|
025850|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_170.wav|||We have managed to get it under control.|
025851|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_171.wav|||We have a genuine budget in place.|
025852|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_172.wav|||Art is still a risky investment.|
025853|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_173.wav|||It was little else.|
025854|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_174.wav|||These things can happen.|
025855|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_175.wav|||Family members are at her bedside.|
025856|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_176.wav|||You have to go to the edges.|
025857|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_177.wav|||I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.|
025858|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_178.wav|||Harry will be up for it.|
025859|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_179.wav|||He could tell you.|
025860|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_180.wav|||My place is in the kitchen.|
025861|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_181.wav|||He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.|
025862|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_182.wav|||A decision is expected in September.|
025863|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_183.wav|||It was a big departure.|
025864|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_184.wav|||That's the name of the game, though.|
025865|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_185.wav|||It's a huge amount.|
025866|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_186.wav|||The fire was falling from the sky.|
025867|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_187.wav|||I want my mum.|
025868|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_188.wav|||This is simply unjust.|
025869|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_189.wav|||The First Minister is an addict.|
025870|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_190.wav|||Its role is not to interfere.|
025871|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_191.wav|||It is becoming a bit of a habit.|
025872|294-en-f|en|wav/p294_192.wav|||You can't believe a word.|

026527|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026528|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026529|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026530|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026531|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026532|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
026533|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

026537|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
026538|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026539|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
026540|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026541|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
026542|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
026543|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

026878|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_365.wav|||This kind of traffic is commonplace.|

026886|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_373.wav|||It's like English in its underwear.|
026887|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_374.wav|||I've been thinking about it for a year.|

026898|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_385.wav|||One might think that is a power.|

026903|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_390.wav|||And who would argue with that?|
026904|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_391.wav|||I believe that gap is nearly there.|
026905|297-en-f|en|wav/p297_392.wav|||This is the real thing now.|

027347|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
027348|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
027349|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
027350|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
027351|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
027352|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
027353|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
027354|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
027355|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
027356|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
027357|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
027358|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
027359|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
027360|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
027361|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
027362|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
027363|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
027364|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
027365|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
027366|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
027367|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_025.wav|||I just went for it over the weekend.|
027368|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_026.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|

027371|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_029.wav|||My first season in Scotland was fantastic.|
027372|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_030.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
027373|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_031.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
027374|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_032.wav|||It's easy to see why.|
027375|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_033.wav|||I am proud of moments like that.|
027376|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_034.wav|||This is a totally different order of agreement.|
027377|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_035.wav|||Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|
027378|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_036.wav|||He was arrested, but later released without charge.|
027379|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_037.wav|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
027380|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_038.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
027381|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_039.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
027382|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_040.wav|||We agreed to disagree.|
027383|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_041.wav|||If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|
027384|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_042.wav|||If you look at the beginning of Alien.|
027385|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_043.wav|||I've learned from my mistakes.|
027386|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_044.wav|||Today is not about contracts.|
027387|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_045.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
027388|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_046.wav|||That says something for his strength of character.|
027389|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_047.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
027390|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_048.wav|||It's to do with play.|
027391|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_049.wav|||Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|
027392|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_050.wav|||I've just got to do this.|
027393|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_051.wav|||Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.|
027394|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_052.wav|||That was the problem.|
027395|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_053.wav|||Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|
027396|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_054.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
027397|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_055.wav|||Everything else is second.|
027398|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_056.wav|||I think it is a sensible change.|
027399|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_057.wav|||Sex is fun?|
027400|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_058.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
027401|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_059.wav|||He added, It's not a racial problem.|
027402|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_060.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|

027405|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_063.wav|||It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|
027406|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_064.wav|||How could anyone take issue with that?|

027412|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_070.wav|||They had had time for little else.|
027413|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_071.wav|||Both of those promises have already been honoured.|
027414|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_072.wav|||We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|
027415|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_073.wav|||It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|

027426|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_084.wav|||But there was a shift.|

027432|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_090.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
027433|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_091.wav|||There is a growing anger among the group.|
027434|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_092.wav|||We certainly will need to watch him.|
027435|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_093.wav|||I don't think it could be clearer.|
027436|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_094.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|

027448|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_106.wav|||That was the light relief.|
027449|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_107.wav|||I am a wealthy person.|
027450|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_108.wav|||He has one son and one daughter.|
027451|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_109.wav|||He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|
027452|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_110.wav|||That, he claimed, was essential.|

027456|299-en-f|en|wav/p299_114.wav|||I hadn't seen them in eight years.|

027770|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

028063|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_316.wav|||I've been thinking about it for a year.|
028064|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_317.wav|||I enjoy playing with both of them.|

028067|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_320.wav|||Confidence among the allies began to slip.|
028068|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_321.wav|||I got a yellow card.|
028069|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_322.wav|||Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|
028070|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_323.wav|||I don't know what he was capable of.|

028075|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_328.wav|||Maybe it helps us.|
028076|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_329.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
028077|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_330.wav|||She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|
028078|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_331.wav|||However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.|
028079|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_332.wav|||He made no big mistakes.|

028084|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_337.wav|||Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.|

028086|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_339.wav|||But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|
028087|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_340.wav|||Well, was it?|
028088|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_341.wav|||We won't let you down.|
028089|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_342.wav|||What kind of person is he?|
028090|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_343.wav|||Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|
028091|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_344.wav|||He was visited by UK consular officials.|
028092|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_345.wav|||So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.|

028099|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_352.wav|||Who has the second highest?|
028100|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_354.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
028101|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_355.wav|||I didn't even have the first idea.|
028102|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_356.wav|||No person was charged.|
028103|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_357.wav|||I've only met him three times.|
028104|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_358.wav|||You see, my back has gone.|
028105|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_359.wav|||It's a logical consequence of the Formula.|
028106|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_360.wav|||She looked very, very poor.|

028112|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_366.wav|||And here is the rub.|
028113|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_367.wav|||They are also exploited by the markets.|
028114|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_368.wav|||Stewart will travel with some confidence.|
028115|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_369.wav|||I am really looking forward to it.|

028117|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_371.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|

028119|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_373.wav|||I will never get over his death.|

028122|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_376.wav|||The mix with Tiger is perfect.|
028123|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_377.wav|||Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.|
028124|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_378.wav|||Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.|
028125|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_379.wav|||They should have some measure of protection.|
028126|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_380.wav|||They did not threaten anyone.|

028128|300-en-f|en|wav/p300_382.wav|||There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.|

028152|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
028153|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
028154|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
028155|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
028156|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
028157|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
028158|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
028159|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
028160|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
028161|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
028162|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
028163|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
028164|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
028165|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
028166|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
028167|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
028168|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
028169|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
028170|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
028171|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_025.wav|||But it was a great decision he joked.|
028172|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_026.wav|||They changed the world of music.|

028178|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_032.wav|||The punishment was swift.|
028179|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_033.wav|||However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|
028180|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_034.wav|||I kept my side of the bargain.|

028197|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_051.wav|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
028198|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_052.wav|||She is now planning a visit.|

028202|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_056.wav|||No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.|
028203|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_057.wav|||I keep my fingers crossed.|
028204|301-en-f|en|wav/p301_058.wav|||The encounter was to change his life.|

029795|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_152.wav|||He must have sat down, relieved it was over.|
029796|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_153.wav|||He will do so today in Monte Carlo.|

029804|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_161.wav|||But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.|
029805|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_162.wav|||For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.|
029806|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_163.wav|||They want to shut the Scottish Office.|
029807|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_164.wav|||Scotland need to work on two key areas.|
029808|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_165.wav|||We have already begun to do that here.|
029809|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_166.wav|||The home team also had their moments.|
029810|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_167.wav|||They refused to fire on their own countrymen.|
029811|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_168.wav|||In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.|
029812|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_169.wav|||That is where the club has gone wrong.|
029813|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_170.wav|||I got off to a great start.|
029814|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_171.wav|||It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.|

029818|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_175.wav|||I got on very well with Allan.|
029819|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_176.wav|||That has given me great confidence.|
029820|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_177.wav|||This is a dream come true for me.|
029821|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_178.wav|||He was lying face down in the water.|
029822|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_179.wav|||He urged people to forgive.|
029823|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_180.wav|||So he is open to ideas.|
029824|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_181.wav|||Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.|
029825|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_182.wav|||Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.|
029826|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_183.wav|||We are expected to do better than before.|
029827|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_184.wav|||The attacker died in the crash.|
029828|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_185.wav|||I am not even thinking about that.|
029829|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_186.wav|||Angola was a really hard place.|
029830|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_187.wav|||It is giving out the wrong message.|
029831|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_188.wav|||It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.|
029832|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_189.wav|||The sleeper was six hours late.|
029833|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_190.wav|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
029834|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_191.wav|||We want to keep the pound.|
029835|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_192.wav|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
029836|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_193.wav|||He needed seven hours of surgery.|
029837|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_194.wav|||Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.|
029838|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_195.wav|||It just came into my head that day.|
029839|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_196.wav|||Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|
029840|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_197.wav|||They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.|
029841|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_198.wav|||I am saddened to hear of the accident.|
029842|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_199.wav|||Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|
029843|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_200.wav|||He would help me with the form.|
029844|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_201.wav|||The actors just have to say so.|
029845|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_202.wav|||The minister is the engineer.|
029846|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_203.wav|||I think it was briefly considered.|
029847|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_204.wav|||It's a hidden problem.|
029848|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_205.wav|||I lost a part of me.|
029849|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_206.wav|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
029850|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_207.wav|||It's part of the game, isn't it?|
029851|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_208.wav|||I believe in the Church.|
029852|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_209.wav|||Others were even less confident.|
029853|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_210.wav|||It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|
029854|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_211.wav|||So people will come out with these things.|
029855|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_212.wav|||You may have a short memory.|
029856|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_213.wav|||My only ambition is to enjoy my work.|
029857|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_214.wav|||The whole thing is utterly transparent.|
029858|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_215.wav|||Every game against New Zealand is.|
029859|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_216.wav|||That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.|
029860|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_217.wav|||He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|
029861|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_218.wav|||It shows that painting is still relevant.|
029862|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_219.wav|||Then there's one where people play for fun.|
029863|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_220.wav|||It may be his last for a while, too.|
029864|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_221.wav|||They have enough intrusion at the time.|
029865|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_222.wav|||Then one night only three people turn up.|
029866|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_223.wav|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
029867|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_224.wav|||Now we see the impact of global politics.|
029868|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_225.wav|||Borrowing power was one of those improvements.|
029869|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_226.wav|||Appointments should be made on merit.|
029870|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_227.wav|||There have been a lot of lessons learned.|
029871|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_228.wav|||I think we will join the single currency.|
029872|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_229.wav|||Gilbert was not amused.|
029873|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_230.wav|||Everything was up for grabs.|
029874|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_231.wav|||I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|
029875|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_232.wav|||There will not be any charges.|
029876|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_233.wav|||Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|
029877|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_234.wav|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
029878|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_235.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
029879|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_236.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
029880|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_237.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
029881|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_238.wav|||Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|
029882|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_239.wav|||So the process was refined.|
029883|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_240.wav|||I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|
029884|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_241.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
029885|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_242.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
029886|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_243.wav|||He added, It's not a racial problem.|
029887|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_244.wav|||We hope this scheme will change that.|
029888|305-en-f|en|wav/p305_245.wav|||How could anyone take issue with that?|

030391|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_333.wav|||There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|
030392|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_334.wav|||We will be homeless.|
030393|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_335.wav|||I believe he can do a better job.|

030395|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_337.wav|||Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.|

030397|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_339.wav|||But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.|
030398|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_340.wav|||Well, was it?|

030410|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_354.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
030411|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_355.wav|||I didn't even have the first idea.|
030412|306-en-f|en|wav/p306_356.wav|||No person was charged.|

030842|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
030843|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
030844|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_008.wav|||They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
030845|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
030846|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
030847|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
030848|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
030849|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
030850|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
030851|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
030852|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
030853|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
030854|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
030855|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
030856|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
030857|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
030858|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.|
030859|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
030860|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
030861|308-en-f|en|wav/p308_025.wav|||It does make a big difference.|

031265|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031266|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
031267|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
031268|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
031269|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
031270|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
031271|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
031272|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|
031273|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
031274|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
031275|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.|
031276|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
031277|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
031278|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
031279|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031280|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031281|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
031282|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
031283|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
031284|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_025.wav|||He was the youngest of the British team.|
031285|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_026.wav|||I fell in love with the ballet.|

031287|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_028.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
031288|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_029.wav|||Did you see that?|
031289|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_030.wav|||The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|
031290|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_031.wav|||And the winners are.|
031291|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_032.wav|||I can't believe something like this could happen.|
031292|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_033.wav|||Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|
031293|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_034.wav|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|
031294|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_035.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
031295|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_036.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
031296|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_037.wav|||It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|
031297|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_038.wav|||We're still talking with a few people.|
031298|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_039.wav|||But one shouldn't go by that.|
031299|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_040.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
031300|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_041.wav|||Buying our way out is not an option.|
031301|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_042.wav|||There are big names.|
031302|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_043.wav|||That argument has been won.|
031303|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_044.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
031304|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_045.wav|||He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.|
031305|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_046.wav|||And who would argue with that?|
031306|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_047.wav|||I hope you will leave it at that.|
031307|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_048.wav|||We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|
031308|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_049.wav|||They had four children together.|
031309|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_050.wav|||Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
031310|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_051.wav|||Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|
031311|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_052.wav|||I fell to the ground.|
031312|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_053.wav|||They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|
031313|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_054.wav|||They were not defeated.|
031314|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_055.wav|||Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.|
031315|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_056.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
031316|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_057.wav|||All of us know it exists.|
031317|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_058.wav|||Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|
031318|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_059.wav|||This is the band.|

031322|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_063.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
031323|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_064.wav|||We shall not do that.|
031324|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_065.wav|||I have had no social life at all.|
031325|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_066.wav|||Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|
031326|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_067.wav|||Once again, he refused.|
031327|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_068.wav|||This is about the Orange Order.|
031328|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_069.wav|||In fact, they will not be disciplined.|

031330|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_071.wav|||Sub Not Used, McKenzie.|
031331|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_072.wav|||Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|

031339|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_080.wav|||They seem to be backing off from that.|
031340|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_081.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
031341|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_082.wav|||They don't work anymore anyway.|
031342|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_083.wav|||I wish they, too, would get a grip.|
031343|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_084.wav|||I am so sorry.|
031344|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_085.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|
031345|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_086.wav|||Journalists should make him.|
031346|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_087.wav|||I believe we have a good chance.|
031347|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_088.wav|||However, it is no longer with the national team.|
031348|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_089.wav|||She may even appear in some more films.|
031349|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_090.wav|||This is the best moment of my career.|
031350|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_091.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
031351|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_092.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
031352|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_093.wav|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
031353|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_094.wav|||I agree with them.|
031354|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_095.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
031355|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_096.wav|||Now he will have to start again.|
031356|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_097.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|
031357|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_098.wav|||I don't know how it happened.|
031358|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_099.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|

031361|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_102.wav|||We shall rely on human beings.|
031362|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_103.wav|||In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.|
031363|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_104.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
031364|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_105.wav|||His treatment has been quite atrocious.|
031365|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_106.wav|||It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|
031366|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_107.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
031367|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_108.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
031368|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_109.wav|||Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|
031369|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_110.wav|||My dad was working in Ayrshire.|

031372|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_113.wav|||But there is another side.|
031373|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_114.wav|||Drugs and housebreaking are linked.|
031374|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_115.wav|||There is no guarantee.|
031375|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_116.wav|||I'm confident we can turn things around.|
031376|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_117.wav|||We want to get to the final, anyway.|
031377|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_118.wav|||It may be argued.|
031378|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_119.wav|||He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.|
031379|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_120.wav|||I bought a car at auction.|
031380|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_121.wav|||And who were they anyway, beforehand?|
031381|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_122.wav|||His three-year appointment begins on Monday.|
031382|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_123.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
031383|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_124.wav|||Five in a month isn't good enough.|
031384|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_125.wav|||Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.|
031385|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_126.wav|||This is just one example.|
031386|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_127.wav|||Both offices were closed yesterday.|
031387|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_128.wav|||They don't have to, but they normally do.|
031388|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_129.wav|||We stopped at half-time.|
031389|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_130.wav|||Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|
031390|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_131.wav|||David was not either.|
031391|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_132.wav|||Britain may now be forced to listen.|
031392|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_133.wav|||We don't see it as downgrading.|
031393|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_134.wav|||He wanted someone young and ambitious.|
031394|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_135.wav|||No date has been set for the appeal.|
031395|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_136.wav|||He is dying from cancer.|
031396|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_137.wav|||People can describe a moment in their life.|
031397|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_138.wav|||What's the rush?|
031398|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_139.wav|||The starting point is pretty unusual.|
031399|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_140.wav|||However, they will only be found in the wild.|
031400|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_141.wav|||They receive a high profile in the media.|
031401|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_142.wav|||It was an ambush.|
031402|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_143.wav|||I think this proposal is excellent.|
031403|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_144.wav|||If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|
031404|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_145.wav|||Is that too much to ask?|
031405|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_146.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|
031406|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_147.wav|||I've so much respect for him.|
031407|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_148.wav|||Each one has its own system.|
031408|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_149.wav|||I felt under no pressure today.|
031409|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_150.wav|||The Devil is the creator of weapons.|
031410|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_151.wav|||And that was the adults.|
031411|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_152.wav|||Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.|
031412|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_153.wav|||This is a job for the Government.|
031413|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_154.wav|||I felt the head was very like me.|
031414|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_155.wav|||We started with that.|
031415|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_156.wav|||And he had much need.|
031416|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_157.wav|||Last night the bombardment was terrible.|
031417|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_158.wav|||This can only help us go forward.|
031418|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_159.wav|||It's never the same problem.|
031419|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_160.wav|||But, even so, you always want to try something new.|
031420|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_161.wav|||Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.|
031421|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_162.wav|||I hadn't been looking after myself.|
031422|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_163.wav|||I was over the moon.|
031423|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_164.wav|||And really, the songs are the key thing.|
031424|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_165.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031425|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_166.wav|||His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|
031426|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_167.wav|||Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.|
031427|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_168.wav|||And then came the seventies.|
031428|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_169.wav|||I guess it is down to focus.|
031429|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_170.wav|||Last week, he was taken to the hospital.|
031430|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_171.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
031431|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_172.wav|||His track record is not promising.|
031432|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_173.wav|||No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|
031433|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_174.wav|||He put a lot of effort into it.|
031434|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_175.wav|||However, you have just got to adjust it.|
031435|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_176.wav|||That was moving the goalposts.|
031436|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_177.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
031437|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_178.wav|||We have the location, which is assured.|
031438|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_179.wav|||The club are feeling no different today.|
031439|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_180.wav|||What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|
031440|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_181.wav|||I see the extended family once a year.|
031441|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_182.wav|||I'm not a magician.|
031442|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_183.wav|||We couldn't go very fast.|
031443|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_185.wav|||There was even a joke.|
031444|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_186.wav|||Tony Blair, can you see her face?|
031445|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_187.wav|||This guy is never going to give up.|
031446|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_188.wav|||They had previously been on five-day notice.|
031447|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_189.wav|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|
031448|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_190.wav|||The show is small but perfectly formed.|
031449|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_191.wav|||This is the first job of the director - leadership.|
031450|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_192.wav|||It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|
031451|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_193.wav|||It is too early to speculate.|
031452|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_194.wav|||I just had so much fun.|
031453|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_195.wav|||Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|
031454|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_196.wav|||I will wait until later.|
031455|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_197.wav|||Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|
031456|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_198.wav|||She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|
031457|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_199.wav|||Or so we have long assumed.|
031458|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_200.wav|||They responded with victories.|
031459|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_201.wav|||That was the personal impulse.|
031460|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_202.wav|||I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|
031461|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_203.wav|||But first it goes out on TV.|
031462|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_204.wav|||What is the truth about the cow?|
031463|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_205.wav|||They will want to watch a winning team.|
031464|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_206.wav|||I think it's awful.|
031465|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_207.wav|||Who is going to be penalised?|
031466|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_208.wav|||This will be just another tax on motorists.|
031467|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_209.wav|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
031468|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_210.wav|||One must hope not!|
031469|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_211.wav|||He is a Satan.|
031470|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_212.wav|||Just see where the blood is coming from.|
031471|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_213.wav|||He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|
031472|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_214.wav|||In her opinion, the rich are different.|
031473|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_215.wav|||Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|
031474|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_216.wav|||I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|
031475|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_217.wav|||There was no cohesion.|
031476|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_218.wav|||He was jailed for five years.|
031477|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_219.wav|||Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|
031478|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_220.wav|||We will not break even.|
031479|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_221.wav|||We will look into it.|
031480|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_222.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
031481|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_223.wav|||But he's not afraid to take risks.|
031482|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_224.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
031483|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_225.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
031484|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_226.wav|||However, it very nearly went wrong.|
031485|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_227.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
031486|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_228.wav|||Things are moving together.|
031487|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_229.wav|||I get to work with very good people.|
031488|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_230.wav|||A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|
031489|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_231.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
031490|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_232.wav|||Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|
031491|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_233.wav|||Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|
031492|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_234.wav|||Look at the table.|
031493|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_235.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
031494|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_236.wav|||I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|
031495|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_237.wav|||Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|
031496|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_238.wav|||Last year was not a good year.|
031497|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_239.wav|||It's a difficult job.|
031498|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_240.wav|||We can't get over it.|
031499|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_241.wav|||Several hundred people attended yesterday.|
031500|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_242.wav|||My preference is for the single vaccines.|
031501|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_243.wav|||This represents a tough game for us.|
031502|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_244.wav|||He saw it all as a big game.|
031503|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_245.wav|||They are not an item.|
031504|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_246.wav|||And thought we would get away with it.|
031505|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_247.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
031506|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_248.wav|||It's more like a Labour Party rally.|
031507|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_249.wav|||Staff should be paid for what they produce.|
031508|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_250.wav|||I would urge the Government to think again.|
031509|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_251.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
031510|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_252.wav|||They were on holiday in Egypt.|
031511|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_253.wav|||I was happiest with my short game.|
031512|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_254.wav|||We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|
031513|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_255.wav|||We went on to become very successful.|
031514|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_256.wav|||Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.|
031515|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_257.wav|||No, is the answer to your first question.|
031516|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_258.wav|||We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|
031517|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_259.wav|||That could be at least five years away.|
031518|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_260.wav|||That is my role.|
031519|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_261.wav|||He also presented You Bet!|
031520|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_262.wav|||That's the day job.|
031521|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_263.wav|||It really is taken seriously.|
031522|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_264.wav|||We have not given up hope.|
031523|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_265.wav|||I'm looking at ways to do that now.|
031524|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_266.wav|||Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|
031525|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_267.wav|||It's such a trial!|
031526|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_268.wav|||That kind of growth is the important thing.|
031527|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_269.wav|||I think it is totally wrong.|
031528|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_270.wav|||And a film maker was born.|
031529|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_271.wav|||It was also put on the Internet.|
031530|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_272.wav|||The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.|
031531|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_273.wav|||And yet his legacy is doubtful.|
031532|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_274.wav|||It seems to have worked.|
031533|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_275.wav|||Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|
031534|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_276.wav|||There was a battle there.|
031535|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_277.wav|||This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|
031536|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_278.wav|||Well, when did he ever refuse?|
031537|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_279.wav|||Today's ruling confirms that.|
031538|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_280.wav|||It's good news and long overdue.|
031539|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_281.wav|||THE atmosphere was electric.|
031540|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_282.wav|||I'd never heard him in person before.|
031541|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_283.wav|||We're going to change our party.|
031542|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_284.wav|||Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|
031543|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_285.wav|||I have learned a lot from him.|
031544|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_286.wav|||Is he any good in the kitchen?|
031545|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_287.wav|||He has been campaigning for change for years.|
031546|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_288.wav|||A formal decision will be announced within months.|
031547|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_289.wav|||He must have something up his sleeve.|
031548|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_290.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
031549|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_291.wav|||We make good weapons.|
031550|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_292.wav|||So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|
031551|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_293.wav|||This is not a Scottish problem.|
031552|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_294.wav|||Then followed a bout of flu.|
031553|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_295.wav|||The balance isn't there at EMI.|
031554|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_296.wav|||That was the most annoying thing.|
031555|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_297.wav|||We are being hijacked.|
031556|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_298.wav|||We had no part in it.|
031557|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_299.wav|||It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.|
031558|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_300.wav|||Mike Tyson went to prison.|
031559|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_301.wav|||It was nice to get a clean sheet.|
031560|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_302.wav|||Our young people are leaving.|
031561|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_303.wav|||And there is no cause for it.|
031562|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_304.wav|||That would have been too easy.|
031563|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_305.wav|||She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|
031564|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_306.wav|||This is not a faceless system.|
031565|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_307.wav|||This is a long-term discussion paper.|
031566|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_308.wav|||In all cases computer equipment was seized.|
031567|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_309.wav|||It is just like the stock market.|
031568|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_310.wav|||The damage from the fire was huge.|
031569|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
031570|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_312.wav|||Both agreed on the success of the event.|
031571|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_313.wav|||What, then, is the real thing?|
031572|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_314.wav|||Boarding school was equally protective.|
031573|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_315.wav|||Most people know that.|
031574|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_316.wav|||It will be the final push.|
031575|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_317.wav|||Clearly, this was the important nursing.|
031576|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_318.wav|||Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|
031577|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_319.wav|||The campaign was raucous.|
031578|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_320.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
031579|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_321.wav|||But both were involved with other matters.|
031580|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_322.wav|||But we were wrong.|
031581|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_323.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
031582|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_324.wav|||However, in October another partnership was announced.|
031583|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_325.wav|||There is no threat to them.|
031584|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_326.wav|||Nelson does not disappoint.|
031585|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_327.wav|||The goal will stay with me forever.|
031586|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_328.wav|||The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|
031587|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_329.wav|||Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|
031588|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_330.wav|||It is a high time to act.|
031589|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_331.wav|||Then we will face the Danish champions.|
031590|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_332.wav|||He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|
031591|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_333.wav|||The South African defended his work ethic.|
031592|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_334.wav|||We have a team to reach the final.|
031593|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_335.wav|||There was barely a handful of chances.|
031594|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_336.wav|||The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.|
031595|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_337.wav|||I have found my vision.|
031596|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_338.wav|||We don't know the scale of need.|
031597|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_339.wav|||You need a reason for staying.|
031598|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_340.wav|||Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.|
031599|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_341.wav|||However, we have not come to any conclusions.|
031600|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_342.wav|||I don't expect to see that this time.|
031601|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_343.wav|||You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|
031602|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_344.wav|||The big issue for us is the review.|
031603|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_345.wav|||That is not the way we should operate.|
031604|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_346.wav|||More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.|
031605|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_347.wav|||The new work will begin in the autumn.|
031606|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_348.wav|||The written judgment was issued in printed form.|
031607|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_349.wav|||He showed he has some things to learn.|
031608|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_350.wav|||Or do they?|
031609|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_351.wav|||They are the innocent victims.|
031610|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_352.wav|||It is now time for justice.|
031611|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_353.wav|||That is of no use.|
031612|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_354.wav|||I could have been offended.|
031613|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_355.wav|||Now it is measuring it in dollars.|
031614|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_356.wav|||But he is frustrated at every turn.|
031615|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_357.wav|||He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.|
031616|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_358.wav|||This is the lowest of the low.|
031617|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_359.wav|||Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|
031618|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_360.wav|||Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|
031619|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_361.wav|||He's a nice guy.|
031620|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_362.wav|||The milk industry is in turmoil.|
031621|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_363.wav|||I love the moment of being first.|
031622|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_364.wav|||It is a decision which has paid off.|
031623|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_365.wav|||Their mind was already made up.|
031624|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_366.wav|||I had some time with Aston Villa.|
031625|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_367.wav|||But it's got to be worth it.|
031626|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_368.wav|||But does the same thing happen with music?|
031627|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_369.wav|||I just couldn't believe what had happened.|
031628|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_370.wav|||Alex is a big part of that future.|
031629|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_371.wav|||Pray that is so.|
031630|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_372.wav|||In fact it isn't related to either.|
031631|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_373.wav|||There was support from across the board.|
031632|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_374.wav|||There may be some evidence to this effect.|
031633|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_375.wav|||It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|
031634|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_376.wav|||So what does one do?|
031635|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_377.wav|||Such actions are rarely popular.|
031636|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_378.wav|||The methadone programme is completely out of control.|
031637|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_379.wav|||That is why it's so lyrical.|
031638|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_380.wav|||I joined a group.|
031639|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_381.wav|||I've heard this stuff about the markets.|
031640|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_382.wav|||It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|
031641|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_383.wav|||It has removed a bit of guilt.|
031642|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_384.wav|||And they all had these other commitments.|
031643|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_385.wav|||However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|
031644|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_386.wav|||Here, again, they were denied a voice.|
031645|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_387.wav|||They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.|
031646|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_388.wav|||Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|
031647|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_389.wav|||I never agreed with that.|
031648|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_390.wav|||I didn't actually believe them at first.|
031649|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_391.wav|||Have you heard anything from Paramount?|
031650|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_392.wav|||We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.|
031651|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_393.wav|||We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|
031652|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_394.wav|||There was only one hole in it.|
031653|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_395.wav|||I don't think it's vital.|
031654|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_396.wav|||It might not survive the process.|
031655|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_397.wav|||They keep the atmosphere in mind.|
031656|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_398.wav|||My father died in childbirth.|
031657|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_399.wav|||The issue has still to be resolved.|
031658|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_400.wav|||Which brings us to the Scottish connection.|
031659|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_401.wav|||It is a catalogue of obstruction.|
031660|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_402.wav|||I'm happy to contribute to that.|
031661|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_403.wav|||Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|
031662|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_404.wav|||We were close, but not close enough.|
031663|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_405.wav|||And that started me thinking.|
031664|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_406.wav|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
031665|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_407.wav|||It brings together two essential elements.|
031666|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_408.wav|||Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|
031667|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_409.wav|||We had a reunion last week.|
031668|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_410.wav|||This will help our confidence.|
031669|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_411.wav|||We have high hopes that this will work.|
031670|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_412.wav|||They also have good neighbours.|
031671|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_413.wav|||People ask about the concept of a team.|

031673|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_415.wav|||The film is about the cost of genius.|
031674|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_416.wav|||They've been here before.|
031675|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_417.wav|||I want a free vote.|
031676|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_418.wav|||He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|
031677|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_419.wav|||It would show them a positive way forward.|
031678|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_420.wav|||I think it's a disgrace.|
031679|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_421.wav|||So he should be.|
031680|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_422.wav|||He also admitted possessing a firearm.|
031681|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_423.wav|||ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|
031682|310-en-f|en|wav/p310_424.wav|||Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.|
031683|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
031684|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
031685|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
031686|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
031687|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
031688|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031689|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
031690|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
031691|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
031692|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
031693|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
031694|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
031695|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
031696|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
031697|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
031698|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
031699|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
031700|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
031701|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
031702|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031703|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031704|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
031705|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
031706|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
031707|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_025.wav|||No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.|
031708|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_026.wav|||It's ahead of Labour.|
031709|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_027.wav|||It is the whole package.|
031710|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_028.wav|||I was totally wrong.|
031711|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_029.wav|||It was a matter of chance.|
031712|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_030.wav|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
031713|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_031.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
031714|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_032.wav|||We keep a distance.|
031715|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_033.wav|||She went home from school and never returned.|
031716|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_034.wav|||Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|
031717|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_035.wav|||With actors it is slightly different.|

031719|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_037.wav|||They did a very good job.|
031720|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_038.wav|||That's what we're still trying to do.|
031721|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_039.wav|||He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.|
031722|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_040.wav|||We cannot go on in this fashion.|
031723|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_041.wav|||We must learn to finish.|
031724|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_042.wav|||There can be no two ways about it.|
031725|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_043.wav|||I knew my contract was up this year.|
031726|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_044.wav|||I am content with the silver.|
031727|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_045.wav|||People acted too quickly.|
031728|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_046.wav|||My heart is with the artist.|
031729|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_047.wav|||That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|
031730|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_048.wav|||There are different cultures in different departments.|
031731|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_049.wav|||What would you do if you didn't work?|
031732|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_050.wav|||They are already on the way there.|
031733|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_051.wav|||The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|
031734|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_052.wav|||This is a holy place.|
031735|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_053.wav|||We will miss him very much.|
031736|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_054.wav|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
031737|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_055.wav|||They should go ahead as normal.|
031738|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_056.wav|||At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|
031739|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_057.wav|||It ended as it began, in confusion.|
031740|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_058.wav|||I just went a bit too far.|
031741|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_059.wav|||I am delighted for Simon.|
031742|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_060.wav|||His third goal was superb.|
031743|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_061.wav|||I don't have a problem with getting older.|
031744|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_062.wav|||It has been declared.|
031745|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_063.wav|||Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|
031746|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_064.wav|||The scientific debate is dead.|
031747|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_065.wav|||Only one got through.|
031748|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_066.wav|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
031749|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_067.wav|||He is a visionary.|
031750|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_068.wav|||I was the trial judge in both.|

031752|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_070.wav|||It happens in many countries.|
031753|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_071.wav|||It's not just about the shows.|
031754|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_072.wav|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
031755|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_073.wav|||I have spoken to the skipper.|
031756|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_074.wav|||Already the children are dying.|
031757|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_075.wav|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
031758|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_076.wav|||We don't do this for everyone, of course.|
031759|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_077.wav|||I can't wait to meet him.|
031760|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_078.wav|||THE pain was almost too much to bear.|
031761|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_079.wav|||It's the same as Glasgow.|
031762|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_080.wav|||We've got a job to do.|
031763|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_081.wav|||You just have to adjust.|
031764|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_082.wav|||Well, that's just a third district.|
031765|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_083.wav|||I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.|
031766|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_084.wav|||They are there to help us.|
031767|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_085.wav|||He added, We are not prepared for war.|
031768|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_086.wav|||My wife and family are the support system.|
031769|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_087.wav|||Sub Not Used, McArthur.|
031770|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_088.wav|||I have hardly any commitments.|
031771|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_089.wav|||The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|
031772|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_090.wav|||It is a very special place.|
031773|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_091.wav|||Some things in life you have to accept.|
031774|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_092.wav|||I am relishing the challenge.|
031775|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_093.wav|||It is set in Paris.|
031776|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_094.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
031777|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_095.wav|||Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.|
031778|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_096.wav|||Surely history will not repeat itself.|
031779|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_097.wav|||The initial report has been completed.|

031781|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_099.wav|||It's like an extension of your body.|
031782|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_100.wav|||It is quite a new prescription.|
031783|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_101.wav|||Johnsen is equally concerned.|
031784|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_102.wav|||Which he is, too.|

031787|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_105.wav|||It is easy to agree with him.|
031788|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_106.wav|||He, too, will return.|
031789|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_107.wav|||Is there anything in the wound?|
031790|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_108.wav|||Chambers said he would accept the place.|
031791|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_109.wav|||Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|
031792|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_110.wav|||It is not really used by many people.|
031793|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_111.wav|||There could be no dispute about our history.|
031794|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_112.wav|||He has one son and one daughter.|
031795|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_113.wav|||Don't get me wrong.|
031796|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_114.wav|||It is nearly there.|
031797|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_115.wav|||Otherwise we will pay the price.|
031798|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_116.wav|||I find it rather oppressive.|
031799|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_117.wav|||They are all Arabs.|
031800|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_118.wav|||It is already making a difference.|
031801|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_119.wav|||He decides to do something about it.|
031802|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_120.wav|||There were no new cases yesterday.|
031803|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_121.wav|||Someone else has now got them.|
031804|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_122.wav|||But once again it was not converted.|
031805|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_123.wav|||These figures are truly terrible.|
031806|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_124.wav|||This is a most serious matter.|
031807|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_125.wav|||I let go the telephone and ran.|
031808|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_126.wav|||Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.|
031809|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_127.wav|||After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|
031810|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_128.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
031811|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_129.wav|||The hearing was continued until a later date.|
031812|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_130.wav|||Still, some additions are inspired.|
031813|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_131.wav|||Planning is a key issue.|
031814|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_132.wav|||Did he always want to be a comedian?|
031815|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_133.wav|||The way ahead is not easy.|
031816|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_134.wav|||I could do a better job.|
031817|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_135.wav|||Yet what is supposed to be said?|
031818|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_136.wav|||Parole isn't a decision for me.|
031819|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_137.wav|||I get the bus.|
031820|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_138.wav|||We are still the best team in Britain.|
031821|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_139.wav|||They got the job done.|
031822|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_140.wav|||It's a horrific incident.|
031823|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_141.wav|||They have been contrasting years, certainly.|
031824|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_142.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031825|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_143.wav|||We've not won anything yet.|
031826|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_144.wav|||They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|
031827|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_145.wav|||There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|
031828|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_146.wav|||They did not let him down.|
031829|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_147.wav|||I believe in trade unions.|
031830|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_148.wav|||This is in a league of its own.|
031831|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_149.wav|||It's been such a waste of money.|
031832|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_150.wav|||The money is not really our concern.|
031833|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_151.wav|||You just know it.|
031834|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_152.wav|||Now, she has completed a family tradition.|
031835|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_153.wav|||I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|
031836|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_154.wav|||We have the easy part.|
031837|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_155.wav|||At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.|
031838|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_156.wav|||It's like a high school play.|
031839|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_157.wav|||He was part of South Africa.|
031840|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_158.wav|||It's there for people to look at.|
031841|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_159.wav|||The party will make up its own mind.|
031842|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_160.wav|||At least two women were among those arrested.|
031843|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_161.wav|||They never got into the show this time.|
031844|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_162.wav|||But no, it's not funny.|
031845|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_163.wav|||In that case, the children were not missing.|
031846|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_164.wav|||He changed my life.|
031847|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_165.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
031848|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_166.wav|||Two options are being proposed.|
031849|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_167.wav|||They haven't been thought through.|
031850|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_168.wav|||The criteria have changed.|
031851|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_169.wav|||O, Is there a lot of blood?|
031852|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_170.wav|||Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|
031853|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_171.wav|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
031854|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_172.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
031855|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_173.wav|||This is a very interesting move.|
031856|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_174.wav|||The highest rate is in Glasgow.|
031857|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_175.wav|||His only reply was a laugh.|
031858|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_176.wav|||those who are preparing to give up.|
031859|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_177.wav|||What kind of festival is proposed?|
031860|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_178.wav|||I was delighted with every one of them.|
031861|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_179.wav|||Sure the COE is a cracking band.|
031862|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_180.wav|||Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|
031863|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_181.wav|||That will help my case a bit.|
031864|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_182.wav|||It was entirely justified.|
031865|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_183.wav|||He looked at me before replying.|
031866|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_184.wav|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
031867|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_185.wav|||It feels that the game is off.|
031868|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_186.wav|||There will be no change in government.|
031869|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_187.wav|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
031870|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_188.wav|||But we still don't know.|
031871|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_189.wav|||Who do you think you are?|
031872|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_190.wav|||Glasgow is a tour de force.|
031873|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_191.wav|||I have no battle with the Scots.|
031874|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_192.wav|||It is all credit to them today.|
031875|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_193.wav|||I have done ever since it was published.|
031876|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_194.wav|||Nobody could survive on that.|
031877|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_195.wav|||They seem to turn up for them.|
031878|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_196.wav|||They were kept there for a summer.|
031879|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_197.wav|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
031880|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_198.wav|||It is that sort of film.|
031881|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_199.wav|||She was not hard done by.|
031882|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_200.wav|||Can you believe it?|
031883|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_201.wav|||I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|
031884|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_202.wav|||They are now out in the cold.|
031885|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_203.wav|||However, planners should be taking the lead.|
031886|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_204.wav|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
031887|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_205.wav|||Our message was inclusive.|
031888|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_206.wav|||This has been a shock.|
031889|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_207.wav|||Yet the survey has been cautious.|
031890|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_208.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
031891|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_209.wav|||There has also been some Scots input.|
031892|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_210.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
031893|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_211.wav|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
031894|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_212.wav|||But who will buy it?|
031895|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_213.wav|||It had to be more flexible.|
031896|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_214.wav|||Openness is always the best way.|
031897|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_215.wav|||It wouldn't go off.|
031898|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_216.wav|||It can be halted.|
031899|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_217.wav|||This was a lot of numbers.|
031900|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_218.wav|||Would it be good for the Nationwide League?|
031901|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_219.wav|||Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|
031902|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_220.wav|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
031903|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_221.wav|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
031904|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_222.wav|||The professor said the results were positive.|
031905|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_223.wav|||I think he's the favourite, no question.|
031906|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_224.wav|||But it's just great to have won.|
031907|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_225.wav|||And it paid off.|
031908|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_226.wav|||Gone with them is any sense of narrative.|
031909|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_227.wav|||Those Were The Days, indeed.|
031910|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_228.wav|||I never made any offer to Mark.|
031911|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_229.wav|||It should be scrapped.|
031912|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_230.wav|||He admitted the asylum system was not working.|
031913|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_231.wav|||They are just trying to cover up.|
031914|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_232.wav|||We have to defend ourselves.|
031915|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_233.wav|||I came here this week to work.|
031916|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_234.wav|||Where do we go from here?|
031917|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_235.wav|||Barry Ferguson is one of them.|
031918|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_236.wav|||He gets his moment.|
031919|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_237.wav|||This was an option from the beginning.|
031920|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_238.wav|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
031921|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_239.wav|||It's not a party, no, no.|
031922|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_240.wav|||It's not that clear-cut.|
031923|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_241.wav|||It may not be life long.|
031924|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_242.wav|||It was just above the roof.|
031925|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_243.wav|||It has changed, and not for the better.|
031926|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_244.wav|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
031927|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_245.wav|||Everyone must be focused on the league.|
031928|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_246.wav|||The English are coming.|
031929|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_247.wav|||I believe in theatre.|
031930|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_248.wav|||Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|
031931|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_249.wav|||However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|
031932|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_250.wav|||It's time to say enough is enough.|
031933|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_251.wav|||Mentally, you have to be tough.|
031934|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_252.wav|||He has to pull back from the brink.|
031935|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_253.wav|||She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|
031936|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_254.wav|||That's my daughter acting.|
031937|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_255.wav|||The film has also been superbly designed.|
031938|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_256.wav|||The performance was really, really immense.|
031939|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_257.wav|||Faces from the Eighties.|
031940|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_258.wav|||The family baton is handed on.|
031941|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_259.wav|||How can this be?|
031942|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_260.wav|||We are still alive and kicking.|
031943|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_261.wav|||I want to go now.|
031944|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_262.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
031945|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_263.wav|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
031946|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_264.wav|||All the children on the roll are genuine.|
031947|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_265.wav|||They said we were out of touch.|
031948|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_266.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
031949|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_267.wav|||There is no signature.|
031950|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_268.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
031951|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_269.wav|||The kids are paying the price.|
031952|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_270.wav|||He said he was delighted by the award.|
031953|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_271.wav|||They didn't find any substance.|
031954|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_272.wav|||They still have the dirty work to do.|
031955|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_273.wav|||I've never seen a game like it.|
031956|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_274.wav|||It doesn't seem like that long ago.|
031957|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_275.wav|||He will do very well.|
031958|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_276.wav|||They also intend to travel today.|
031959|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_277.wav|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
031960|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_278.wav|||The casualties were not named.|
031961|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_279.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
031962|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_280.wav|||There are two ways to start a festival.|
031963|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_281.wav|||I am very happy with life.|
031964|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_282.wav|||Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|
031965|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_283.wav|||My office is down there.|
031966|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_284.wav|||Even then this game was not over.|
031967|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_285.wav|||Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.|
031968|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_286.wav|||We also hope to meet the men.|
031969|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_287.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
031970|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_288.wav|||It has become very confused.|
031971|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_289.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
031972|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_290.wav|||I am not in denial.|
031973|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_291.wav|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
031974|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_292.wav|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
031975|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_293.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
031976|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
031977|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_295.wav|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
031978|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_296.wav|||Then there's the Old Firm.|
031979|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_297.wav|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
031980|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_298.wav|||We were in different places, usually in cellars.|
031981|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_299.wav|||They're not always the same person.|
031982|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_300.wav|||It would have to be backdated.|
031983|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_301.wav|||He said he was sorry.|
031984|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_302.wav|||My position on the euro is quite clear.|
031985|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_303.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
031986|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_304.wav|||We have worked well with them for years.|
031987|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_305.wav|||That was me today.|
031988|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_306.wav|||That is the consistent approach of the Government.|
031989|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_307.wav|||That is when we are really effective.|
031990|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_308.wav|||The director's a genius.|
031991|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_309.wav|||There was no sign that anything was amiss.|
031992|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_310.wav|||It was the climax of the thing.|
031993|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_311.wav|||This is new money.|
031994|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_312.wav|||We have not given up on the game.|
031995|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_313.wav|||The decision was left entirely to him.|
031996|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_314.wav|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
031997|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_315.wav|||Nobody should believe this story.|
031998|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_316.wav|||This is not out of choice.|
031999|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_317.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
032000|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_318.wav|||But this one has a lot of potential.|
032001|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_319.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
032002|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_320.wav|||We'll see what happens.|
032003|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_321.wav|||This was another video cassette.|
032004|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_322.wav|||If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|
032005|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_323.wav|||It will make a huge difference.|
032006|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_324.wav|||He pretended not to care.|
032007|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_325.wav|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
032008|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_326.wav|||I was in tears in the street.|
032009|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_327.wav|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
032010|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_328.wav|||No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.|
032011|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_329.wav|||But that's not the idea behind this article.|
032012|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_330.wav|||If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|
032013|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_331.wav|||That is why we are here.|
032014|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_332.wav|||The German had a point to make.|
032015|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_333.wav|||This time, however, may have been different.|
032016|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_334.wav|||You have to feel for the guy.|
032017|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_335.wav|||However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|
032018|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_336.wav|||Bomber was not amused.|
032019|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_337.wav|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
032020|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_338.wav|||Was it just negligent.|
032021|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_339.wav|||And suddenly it became a free-for-all.|
032022|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_340.wav|||This Government is cutting taxes.|
032023|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_341.wav|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
032024|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_342.wav|||This is a big club.|
032025|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_343.wav|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
032026|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_344.wav|||They will now get that support.|
032027|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_345.wav|||I feel it's time to make the switch.|
032028|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_346.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
032029|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_347.wav|||I've no problem with what they said.|
032030|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_348.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
032031|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_349.wav|||I think we have got the balance right.|
032032|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_350.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
032033|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_351.wav|||It is physical but it is also good.|
032034|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_352.wav|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
032035|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_353.wav|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|
032036|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_354.wav|||So it goes on.|
032037|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_355.wav|||We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|
032038|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_356.wav|||I hope they will understand the reasons.|
032039|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_357.wav|||They should have listened to me.|
032040|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_358.wav|||I am greatly encouraged.|
032041|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_359.wav|||It was like someone had died.|
032042|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_360.wav|||What does he want him to look like?|
032043|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_361.wav|||The actors are confident and polished.|
032044|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_362.wav|||I hope he would have been very pleased.|
032045|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_363.wav|||We would have concerns about that.|
032046|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_364.wav|||Taxes may need to rise.|
032047|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_365.wav|||It's unusual to say the least.|
032048|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_366.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
032049|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_367.wav|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|
032050|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_368.wav|||I just did not cope with the pressure.|
032051|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_369.wav|||We have some concerns.|
032052|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_370.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
032053|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_371.wav|||This was a chilling echo.|
032054|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_372.wav|||They really want to do it.|
032055|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_373.wav|||And then he laughs.|
032056|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_374.wav|||I recommend a tour.|
032057|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_375.wav|||We don't ask for much.|
032058|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_376.wav|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
032059|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_377.wav|||I had a wonderful time working with him.|
032060|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_378.wav|||We have to start again on Saturday.|
032061|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_379.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
032062|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_380.wav|||And it covers the spectrum.|
032063|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_381.wav|||The replacements made a big difference.|
032064|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_382.wav|||And the winners are.|
032065|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_383.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
032066|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_384.wav|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|
032067|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_385.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
032068|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_386.wav|||There are big names.|
032069|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_387.wav|||My players are precious to me.|
032070|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_388.wav|||That argument has been won.|
032071|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_389.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
032072|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_390.wav|||For us, that decision was hard to understand.|
032073|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_391.wav|||I had to calm down.|
032074|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_392.wav|||Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|
032075|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_393.wav|||She returned home a few days later.|
032076|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_394.wav|||They haven't run away.|
032077|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_395.wav|||Nobody can take it away from me.|
032078|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_396.wav|||She is fulfilled by it.|
032079|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_397.wav|||He said no survivors had been found.|
032080|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_398.wav|||Who can say?|
032081|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_399.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
032082|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_400.wav|||In short, the club was broke.|
032083|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_401.wav|||Sadly, in this case, that was not so.|
032084|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_402.wav|||She is a veteran in the Balkans.|
032085|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_403.wav|||The men are safe and unharmed.|
032086|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_404.wav|||We're not the tourist board.|
032087|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_405.wav|||It was the same old story.|
032088|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_406.wav|||I was frustrated here.|
032089|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_407.wav|||We have reacted well to each other.|
032090|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_408.wav|||Are you watching Liverpool?|
032091|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_409.wav|||I was furious about it.|
032092|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_410.wav|||This will be no easy option.|
032093|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_411.wav|||They knew they shouldn't have been there.|
032094|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_412.wav|||Of course we aren't.|
032095|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_413.wav|||We haven't been told.|
032096|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_414.wav|||It worked well in Monaco.|
032097|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_415.wav|||They were outside the circle.|
032098|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_416.wav|||The whole process was so different.|
032099|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_417.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
032100|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_418.wav|||I agree with them.|
032101|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_419.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
032102|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_420.wav|||We will listen to colleagues.|
032103|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_421.wav|||It's very difficult and very worrying.|
032104|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_422.wav|||It's something we want to make work.|
032105|311-en-m|en|wav/p311_423.wav|||There will be no excuses on Wednesday.|
034211|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
034212|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
034213|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
034214|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034215|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034216|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034217|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034218|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034219|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034220|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034221|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034222|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034223|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034224|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
034225|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034226|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034227|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034228|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034229|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034230|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034231|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
034232|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034233|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_025.wav|||They will be dealt with.|
034234|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_026.wav|||It is never an easy game.|
034235|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_027.wav|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
034236|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_028.wav|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
034237|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_029.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
034238|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_030.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
034239|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_031.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
034240|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_032.wav|||It was important to win the singles.|
034241|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_033.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
034242|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_034.wav|||That is impressive by any standards.|
034243|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_035.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
034244|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
034245|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_037.wav|||This was the performance, and the result they needed.|
034246|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_038.wav|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
034247|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_039.wav|||It helped to get me noticed.|
034248|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_040.wav|||They hit me in the head.|
034249|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_041.wav|||But he is not using them.|
034250|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_042.wav|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
034251|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_043.wav|||We are not moving in.|
034252|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_044.wav|||We have not had a formal request.|
034253|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_045.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
034254|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_046.wav|||Its effect on humans is not yet known.|
034255|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_047.wav|||We offered something different.|
034256|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_048.wav|||We were very much a happy family.|
034257|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_049.wav|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
034258|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_050.wav|||My brother is buried under there.|
034259|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_051.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
034260|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_052.wav|||What were they?|
034261|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_053.wav|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
034262|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_054.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
034263|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_055.wav|||Her role in it was small.|
034264|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_056.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
034265|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_057.wav|||We might be back next year.|
034266|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_058.wav|||In a way he was.|
034267|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_059.wav|||It's back to how it used to be.|
034268|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_060.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
034269|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_061.wav|||The firm was down and almost out.|
034270|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_062.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
034271|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_063.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
034272|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_064.wav|||I learned a lot from that.|
034273|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_065.wav|||The house was so well alight.|
034274|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_066.wav|||He got his degree.|
034275|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_067.wav|||Sandy was very active.|
034276|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
034277|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_069.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
034278|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_070.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
034279|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_071.wav|||There were no formal announcements.|
034280|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
034281|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_073.wav|||It really has left the town in shock.|
034282|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_074.wav|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
034283|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_075.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
034284|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_076.wav|||This was much worse.|
034285|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_077.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
034286|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_078.wav|||We are confident of taking that back.|
034287|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_079.wav|||They must be kept on the ground.|
034288|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_080.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
034289|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_081.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
034290|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_082.wav|||This does not help.|
034291|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_083.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
034292|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_084.wav|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
034293|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_085.wav|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
034294|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_086.wav|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
034295|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_087.wav|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
034296|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_088.wav|||This could be her way forward.|
034297|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_089.wav|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
034298|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_090.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
034299|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_091.wav|||It's a very, very special day.|
034300|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_092.wav|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
034301|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_093.wav|||There's also the point.|
034302|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_094.wav|||It was forced to divert.|
034303|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_095.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
034304|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_096.wav|||That's the National Grid.|
034305|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_097.wav|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
034306|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_098.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|
034307|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_099.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
034308|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_100.wav|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
034309|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_101.wav|||This is my personal assessment.|
034310|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_102.wav|||There was no trouble at all.|
034311|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_103.wav|||Although, you never know.|
034312|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_104.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
034313|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_105.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
034314|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_106.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
034315|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_107.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
034316|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_108.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
034317|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_109.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
034318|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_110.wav|||I took the gun.|
034319|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_111.wav|||It's just one of those things.|
034320|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_112.wav|||A web site is planned for November.|
034321|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_113.wav|||We played so well at times.|
034322|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_114.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
034323|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_115.wav|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
034324|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
034325|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_117.wav|||They will be destroyed.|
034326|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_118.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
034327|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_119.wav|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
034328|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_120.wav|||The Tory party will last.|
034329|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_121.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
034330|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_122.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
034331|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_123.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
034332|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_124.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
034333|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_125.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
034334|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_126.wav|||What's the point?|
034335|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_127.wav|||Why is this?|
034336|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_128.wav|||What has changed since then?|
034337|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_129.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
034338|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_130.wav|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
034339|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_131.wav|||I'd love to be at the World Cup.|
034340|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_132.wav|||He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|
034341|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_133.wav|||I am sorry to hear this news.|
034342|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_134.wav|||At some point, the bill will be presented.|
034343|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_135.wav|||I mean it happens.|
034344|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_136.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
034345|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_137.wav|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
034346|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_138.wav|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
034347|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_139.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
034348|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_140.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
034349|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_141.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
034350|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_142.wav|||It is typical of me.|
034351|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_143.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
034352|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_144.wav|||They played it like a cup final.|
034353|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_145.wav|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
034354|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_146.wav|||But the championship is not over yet.|
034355|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_147.wav|||We haven't found out anything different.|
034356|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_148.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
034357|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_149.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
034358|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_150.wav|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
034359|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_151.wav|||Surely it can do better than that?|
034360|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_152.wav|||I am ashamed of them.|
034361|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_153.wav|||Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|
034362|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_154.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
034363|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_155.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
034364|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_156.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
034365|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_157.wav|||I am not blaming audiences.|
034366|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_158.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
034367|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_159.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
034368|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_160.wav|||He had never run the distance before.|
034369|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_161.wav|||I can make one further announcement.|
034370|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_162.wav|||The General Election is all to play for.|
034371|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_163.wav|||It was a fiery game.|
034372|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_164.wav|||Agents and coaches must be paid.|
034373|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_165.wav|||Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|
034374|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_166.wav|||Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|
034375|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_167.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
034376|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_168.wav|||This one is a special case.|
034377|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_169.wav|||But what are the songs about?|
034378|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_170.wav|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
034379|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_171.wav|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
034380|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_172.wav|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
034381|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_173.wav|||The stadium was full.|
034382|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_174.wav|||Dewar is the medium.|
034383|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_175.wav|||It was that kind of night.|
034384|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_176.wav|||It is very much a matter for them.|
034385|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_177.wav|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
034386|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_178.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
034387|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_179.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
034388|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
034389|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_181.wav|||I hope we do.|
034390|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_182.wav|||From now on there is no hiding place.|
034391|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_183.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
034392|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_184.wav|||He quit in October.|
034393|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_185.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
034394|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_186.wav|||Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|
034395|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_187.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
034396|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_188.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
034397|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_189.wav|||They were that poor.|
034398|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_190.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
034399|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_191.wav|||We have understood the problems for some time.|
034400|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_192.wav|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
034401|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_193.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
034402|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_194.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
034403|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_195.wav|||They believed it worked.|
034404|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_196.wav|||After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|
034405|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_197.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
034406|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_198.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
034407|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_199.wav|||So they will settle again.|
034408|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_200.wav|||How do we get more people in?|
034409|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_201.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
034410|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_202.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
034411|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_203.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
034412|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_204.wav|||Election results are expected soon.|
034413|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_205.wav|||So she told him.|
034414|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_206.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
034415|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_207.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
034416|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_208.wav|||It was good to score the goal today.|
034417|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_209.wav|||The night is young.|
034418|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_210.wav|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
034419|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_211.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
034420|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_212.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
034421|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_213.wav|||The squad will be the same for France.|
034422|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_214.wav|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
034423|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_215.wav|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
034424|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_216.wav|||We are still paying the price for that.|
034425|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_217.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
034426|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_218.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
034427|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_219.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
034428|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_220.wav|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
034429|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_221.wav|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
034430|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_222.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
034431|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_223.wav|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
034432|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_224.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
034433|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_225.wav|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
034434|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_226.wav|||From our point of view, it is the right time.|
034435|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_227.wav|||That figure will always remain with me.|
034436|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_228.wav|||And then a funny thing happened.|
034437|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_229.wav|||It does not take much.|
034438|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_230.wav|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
034439|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_231.wav|||It was a stunning strike.|
034440|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_232.wav|||It is a technique.|
034441|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_233.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
034442|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_234.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
034443|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_235.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
034444|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_236.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
034445|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_237.wav|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
034446|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_238.wav|||There is nothing to fear.|
034447|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_239.wav|||I was an athlete.|
034448|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_240.wav|||Life was like a timetable.|
034449|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_241.wav|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
034450|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_242.wav|||I tried to push him away.|
034451|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_243.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
034452|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_244.wav|||This was done by the council staff.|
034453|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_245.wav|||The truth is otherwise.|
034454|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_246.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
034455|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_247.wav|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
034456|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_248.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
034457|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_249.wav|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
034458|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_250.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
034459|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_251.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
034460|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_252.wav|||The man became a reporter.|
034461|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_253.wav|||It is a memorial.|
034462|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_254.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
034463|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_255.wav|||Our people are paying high prices.|
034464|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_256.wav|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
034465|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_257.wav|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
034466|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_258.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
034467|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
034468|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_260.wav|||I read it every year.|
034469|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_261.wav|||He was in contention almost every week.|
034470|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_262.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
034471|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_263.wav|||It is up to Ann.|
034472|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_264.wav|||We are playing them at their own game.|
034473|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_265.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
034474|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_266.wav|||I had trouble with the producers.|
034475|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_267.wav|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
034476|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_268.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
034477|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_269.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
034478|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_270.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
034479|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_271.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|
034480|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_272.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
034481|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_273.wav|||There is no more money.|
034482|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_274.wav|||My mother is a widow.|
034483|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_275.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
034484|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_276.wav|||There have been different reports from different people.|
034485|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_277.wav|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
034486|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_278.wav|||Something was plainly wrong.|
034487|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_279.wav|||Why should he go anywhere?|
034488|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_280.wav|||One thing is sure.|
034489|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_281.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
034490|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_282.wav|||I'm confident we can do that.|
034491|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_283.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
034492|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_284.wav|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
034493|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_285.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
034494|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_286.wav|||We are talking about the outskirts of London.|
034495|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_287.wav|||The end result is precisely the same.|
034496|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
034497|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_289.wav|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
034498|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_290.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
034499|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_291.wav|||It's never over until it's over.|
034500|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_292.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
034501|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_293.wav|||This year, it was a little different.|
034502|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_294.wav|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
034503|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_295.wav|||We gave them the goal.|
034504|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_296.wav|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
034505|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_297.wav|||What's the point of staying sober?|
034506|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_298.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
034507|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_299.wav|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
034508|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_300.wav|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
034509|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_301.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
034510|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_302.wav|||I can feel the sound inside.|
034511|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_303.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
034512|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_304.wav|||I am not a fan of books.|
034513|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_305.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
034514|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_306.wav|||It may well have been.|
034515|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_307.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
034516|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_308.wav|||It was a simple question.|
034517|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_309.wav|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
034518|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_310.wav|||And we have beaten them before.|
034519|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_311.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
034520|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_312.wav|||I am not a paedophile.|
034521|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_313.wav|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
034522|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_314.wav|||But they had to be paid for.|
034523|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_315.wav|||The odds are that it will.|
034524|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_316.wav|||But then they scored their fourth.|
034525|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_317.wav|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
034526|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_318.wav|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
034527|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_319.wav|||Why is that?|
034528|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_320.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
034529|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_321.wav|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
034530|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_322.wav|||But will they fall in love?|
034531|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_323.wav|||As if they ever stopped.|
034532|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_324.wav|||The referee had a shocking game.|
034533|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_325.wav|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
034534|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_326.wav|||For a few years we had good fun.|
034535|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_327.wav|||Medical staff are with them at the moment.|
034536|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_328.wav|||It went on to become an annual event.|
034537|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_329.wav|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
034538|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_330.wav|||We are now in an election period.|
034539|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_331.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
034540|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_332.wav|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
034541|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_333.wav|||But when we do it is great.|
034542|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_334.wav|||She has nothing to say to journalists.|
034543|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_335.wav|||I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|
034544|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_336.wav|||He pleaded for caution.|
034545|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_337.wav|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
034546|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_338.wav|||They've been wonderful to me.|
034547|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_339.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
034548|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_340.wav|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
034549|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_341.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
034550|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_342.wav|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
034551|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_343.wav|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
034552|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_344.wav|||It's a question of perception.|
034553|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_345.wav|||Staff have been informed.|
034554|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_346.wav|||My heart is not so sure.|
034555|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_347.wav|||This morning was very quiet.|
034556|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_348.wav|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
034557|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_349.wav|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
034558|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_350.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
034559|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_351.wav|||That might help a bit.|
034560|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_352.wav|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
034561|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_353.wav|||He was made redundant in February last year.|
034562|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_354.wav|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
034563|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_355.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
034564|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_356.wav|||You have obviously got an answer to it.|
034565|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_357.wav|||It seems very odd.|
034566|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_358.wav|||Closure is not one of them.|
034567|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_359.wav|||The hotel was huge.|
034568|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_360.wav|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
034569|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_361.wav|||Well, you can have a tree.|
034570|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_362.wav|||It was the same at Twickenham.|
034571|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_363.wav|||This is an internal matter.|
034572|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_364.wav|||I am amazed at what he's done.|
034573|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_365.wav|||They took a risk.|
034574|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_366.wav|||The idea was presented to me.|
034575|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_367.wav|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
034576|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_368.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
034577|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_369.wav|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
034578|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_370.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
034579|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_371.wav|||I see it as my job.|
034580|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_372.wav|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
034581|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_373.wav|||Frank Warren is a great man.|
034582|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_374.wav|||I am a little bit tired.|
034583|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_375.wav|||That was never their agenda.|
034584|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_376.wav|||She died at her home.|
034585|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_377.wav|||She is currently in foster care.|
034586|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_378.wav|||That's the only thing that matters.|
034587|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_379.wav|||I enjoy the creative process.|
034588|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_380.wav|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
034589|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_381.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
034590|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_382.wav|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
034591|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_383.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
034592|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_384.wav|||We have been preparing all year.|
034593|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_385.wav|||We could learn a lot from them.|
034594|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_386.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
034595|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_387.wav|||Sure, we have problems.|
034596|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_388.wav|||I was released after six days.|
034597|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_389.wav|||That time is not far away.|
034598|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_390.wav|||I may think about performing it.|
034599|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_391.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
034600|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_392.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
034601|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_393.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
034602|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_394.wav|||You can't go back and change things.|
034603|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_395.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
034604|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_396.wav|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
034605|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_397.wav|||Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|
034606|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_398.wav|||He says it often enough.|
034607|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_399.wav|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
034608|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_400.wav|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
034609|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_401.wav|||I found that much more challenging.|
034610|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_402.wav|||This fight is not going to go away.|
034611|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_403.wav|||It would have been very easily done.|
034612|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_404.wav|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
034613|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_405.wav|||The Open champion is back.|
034614|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_406.wav|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
034615|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_407.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
034616|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_408.wav|||I want to keep him.|
034617|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_409.wav|||He deserves a top team.|
034618|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_410.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
034619|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_411.wav|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
034620|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_412.wav|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
034621|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_413.wav|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
034622|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
034623|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_415.wav|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
034624|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_416.wav|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
034625|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_417.wav|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
034626|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_418.wav|||Would they work together again?|
034627|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_419.wav|||I didn't play all that well.|
034628|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_420.wav|||Who can tell?|
034629|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_421.wav|||It appears to have been closed down.|
034630|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
034631|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_423.wav|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
034632|318-en-f|en|wav/p318_424.wav|||We have no plans for direct action.|
035456|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
035457|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
035458|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
035459|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
035460|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
035461|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
035462|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035463|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
035464|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
035465|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
035466|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
035467|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
035468|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
035469|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
035470|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
035471|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
035472|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
035473|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
035474|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
035475|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
035476|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
035477|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
035478|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
035479|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
035480|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_025.wav|||But there has never been the time, she said.|
035481|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_026.wav|||This could be one such case, he declared.|
035482|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_027.wav|||It's not a solo.|
035483|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_028.wav|||The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|
035484|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_029.wav|||I fell in love with ballet.|
035485|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_030.wav|||That their music is truly, truly, truly great.|
035486|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_031.wav|||I had found my vision.|
035487|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_032.wav|||The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.|
035488|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_033.wav|||But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.|
035489|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_034.wav|||We don't know the scale of need.|
035490|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_035.wav|||Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.|
035491|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_036.wav|||We had a huge response to that campaign.|
035492|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_037.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
035493|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_038.wav|||I spoke with just one player, but not the others.|
035494|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_039.wav|||We're still talking with a few people.|
035495|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_040.wav|||We know you will not let us down.|
035496|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_041.wav|||He will never walk the streets again.|
035497|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_042.wav|||There are big names.|
035498|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_043.wav|||That argument has been won.|
035499|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_044.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
035500|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_045.wav|||I hope you will leave it at that.|
035501|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_046.wav|||We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.|
035502|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_047.wav|||The bill would be massive.|
035503|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_048.wav|||He was just a journalist.|
035504|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_049.wav|||They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.|
035505|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_050.wav|||Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.|
035506|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_051.wav|||I didn't have a clue.|
035507|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_052.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
035508|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_053.wav|||I have been coming here for nine years.|
035509|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_054.wav|||She has a wonderful mind.|
035510|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_055.wav|||There are just two tournaments remaining.|
035511|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_056.wav|||We're into that build-up now.|
035512|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_057.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
035513|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_058.wav|||I have had no social life at all.|
035514|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_059.wav|||Hopefully they will just give me the degree.|
035515|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_060.wav|||In short, the club was broke.|
035516|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_061.wav|||His charisma is all on the course.|
035517|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_062.wav|||I am still pretty young in this business.|
035518|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_063.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
035519|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_064.wav|||We're not the tourist board.|
035520|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_065.wav|||It was the same old story.|
035521|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_066.wav|||Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|
035522|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_067.wav|||The Commons is too outdated.|
035523|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_068.wav|||You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|
035524|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_069.wav|||What happens when the funding is exhausted.|
035525|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_070.wav|||It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|
035526|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_071.wav|||Europe has lost its way under the socialists.|
035527|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_072.wav|||Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|
035528|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_073.wav|||He would be with his peers.|
035529|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_074.wav|||They seem to be backing off from that.|
035530|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_075.wav|||This will be no easy option.|
035531|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_076.wav|||I wish they, too, would get a grip.|
035532|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_077.wav|||I am so sorry.|
035533|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_078.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|
035534|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_079.wav|||It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|
035535|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_080.wav|||We will see how he is after treatment.|
035536|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_081.wav|||I was there for five hours.|
035537|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_082.wav|||But then he changed his mind.|
035538|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_083.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
035539|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_084.wav|||They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|
035540|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_085.wav|||There are no excuses.|
035541|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_086.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
035542|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_087.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|

035712|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_257.wav|||This is a wonderful honour for me.|
035713|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_258.wav|||In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|

035753|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_298.wav|||This is not a faceless system.|
035754|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_299.wav|||This is a long-term discussion paper.|
035755|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_300.wav|||In all cases computer equipment was seized.|
035756|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_301.wav|||That is just a load of baloney.|
035757|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_302.wav|||I'm feeling very pleased.|
035758|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_303.wav|||The damage from the fire was huge.|
035759|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_304.wav|||She had kept the news from him.|
035760|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_305.wav|||Both agreed on the success of the event.|
035761|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_306.wav|||But we'll just keep trying to get results.|
035762|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_307.wav|||A play is a set of actions.|
035763|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_308.wav|||Clearly, that is important in nursing.|

035793|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_338.wav|||It might have been a satanic ritual.|
035794|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_339.wav|||I'll take the blame for that.|
035795|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_340.wav|||It is now time for justice.|
035796|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_341.wav|||That is no use.|
035797|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_342.wav|||There is great interest on our island.|
035798|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_343.wav|||But he is frustrated at every turn.|
035799|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_344.wav|||Our house was very small.|
035800|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_345.wav|||Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|

035804|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_349.wav|||That is absolute nonsense.|
035805|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_350.wav|||I just had so much fun.|
035806|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_351.wav|||It was quite rigorous.|
035807|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_352.wav|||It is a decision which has paid off.|
035808|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_353.wav|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
035809|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_354.wav|||Their mind was already made up.|

035815|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_360.wav|||No, is the answer to your first question.|
035816|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_361.wav|||There was support from across the board.|
035817|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_362.wav|||There may be some evidence to this effect.|
035818|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_363.wav|||It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|
035819|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_364.wav|||We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.|

035831|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_376.wav|||However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|
035832|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_377.wav|||The written judgment was issued in printed form.|
035833|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_378.wav|||I see no reason for them to be.|
035834|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_379.wav|||Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|
035835|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_380.wav|||I never agreed with that.|

035838|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_383.wav|||He added, however, that all options are under review.|
035839|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_384.wav|||It is a dilemma.|
035840|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_385.wav|||We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.|
035841|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_386.wav|||They keep the atmosphere in mind.|

035845|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_390.wav|||It is a catalogue of obstruction.|
035846|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_391.wav|||I'm happy to contribute to that.|
035847|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_392.wav|||Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|

035851|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_396.wav|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
035852|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_397.wav|||It brings together two essential elements.|
035853|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_398.wav|||The issue has still to be resolved.|
035854|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_399.wav|||He is a joy to watch.|
035855|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_400.wav|||We have high hopes that this will work.|
035856|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_401.wav|||We are now open.|

035872|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_417.wav|||It is so elusive and light.|
035873|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_418.wav|||Or was it Some kind of a ham?|
035874|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_419.wav|||We've come from a long way back.|
035875|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_420.wav|||I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.|

035878|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_423.wav|||What will happen if it all goes wrong?|
035879|329-en-f|en|wav/p329_424.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
035880|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|

035885|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
035886|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035887|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
035888|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
035889|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
035890|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
035891|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
035892|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
035893|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
035894|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
035895|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
035896|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
035897|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
035898|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
035899|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
035900|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
035901|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
035902|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
035903|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
035904|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_025.wav|||Like anyone else, he has to take his time.|
035905|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_026.wav|||I was backing him up.|
035906|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_027.wav|||It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|
035907|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_028.wav|||Surely history will not repeat itself.|
035908|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_029.wav|||That was their attitude.|

035923|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_044.wav|||Our decision making was poor.|
035924|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_045.wav|||Last night they were being comforted by relatives.|
035925|330-en-f|en|wav/p330_046.wav|||They said we were out of touch.|

036703|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_404.wav|||She said he showed no remorse.|
036704|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_405.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
036705|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_406.wav|||After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.|
036706|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_407.wav|||However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.|
036707|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_408.wav|||There's nothing for you here.|
036708|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_409.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
036709|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_410.wav|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
036710|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_411.wav|||It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|
036711|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_412.wav|||I have not come in to take over.|
036712|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_413.wav|||Is this accurate?|
036713|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_414.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
036714|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_415.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
036715|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_416.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
036716|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_417.wav|||The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|
036717|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_418.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
036718|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_419.wav|||They were in good humour, too.|
036719|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_420.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
036720|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_421.wav|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
036721|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_422.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
036722|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_423.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
036723|333-en-f|en|wav/p333_424.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|
036724|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
036725|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
036726|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
036727|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
036728|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
036729|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
036730|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
036731|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
036732|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
036733|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
036734|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
036735|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
036736|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
036737|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
036738|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
036739|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
036740|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
036741|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
036742|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
036743|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
036744|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
036745|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
036746|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
036747|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
036748|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_025.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
036749|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_026.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
036750|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_027.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
036751|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_028.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
036752|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_029.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
036753|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_030.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
036754|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_031.wav|||It was no surprise.|
036755|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_032.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
036756|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_033.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
036757|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_034.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|

036759|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_036.wav|||We could feel the heat.|
036760|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_037.wav|||Darrell was, however, adamant.|
036761|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_038.wav|||He was a member of the Tartan Army.|
036762|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_039.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
036763|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_040.wav|||I wanted to win so badly.|
036764|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_041.wav|||It was an accounting error.|
036765|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_042.wav|||I had enough on.|
036766|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_043.wav|||The offer of help is there for anyone.|
036767|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_044.wav|||There were no passengers on board.|
036768|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_045.wav|||And we're not there yet.|
036769|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_046.wav|||No meaningful response was issued.|
036770|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_047.wav|||And the funny thing is, they usually do.|
036771|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_048.wav|||Times have changed, but have they improved?|
036772|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_049.wav|||Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|
036773|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_050.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
036774|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_051.wav|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
036775|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_052.wav|||It is a form of physical exercise.|
036776|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_053.wav|||plays in dark blue.|
036777|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_054.wav|||But, by that time, of course, it is again.|
036778|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_055.wav|||It is something that we will put right.|
036779|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_056.wav|||Why do it?|
036780|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_057.wav|||It could take three days.|
036781|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_058.wav|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
036782|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_059.wav|||It was totally my fault.|
036783|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_060.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
036784|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_061.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
036785|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_062.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
036786|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_063.wav|||Tomorrow night is the important game.|
036787|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_064.wav|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
036788|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_065.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
036789|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_066.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
036790|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_067.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
036791|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_068.wav|||It was a move which appealed to him.|
036792|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_069.wav|||There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|
036793|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_070.wav|||He will need that machine.|
036794|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_071.wav|||But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|
036795|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_072.wav|||We are looking for volunteers.|
036796|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_073.wav|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
036797|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_074.wav|||It was very personal and very intimate.|
036798|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_075.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
036799|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_076.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
036800|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_077.wav|||They follow him everywhere.|
036801|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_078.wav|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
036802|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_079.wav|||Maybe that was the whole point.|
036803|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_080.wav|||The feeling between the two men was mutual.|
036804|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_081.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
036805|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_082.wav|||So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|
036806|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_083.wav|||This must be really short of ideas.|
036807|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_084.wav|||It was extremely cold.|
036808|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_085.wav|||They use them for everything.|
036809|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_086.wav|||We have the easy part.|
036810|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_087.wav|||I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|
036811|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_088.wav|||They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.|
036812|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_089.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
036813|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_090.wav|||Mr Miller is married with three children.|
036814|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_091.wav|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
036815|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_092.wav|||We already have them, all over Europe.|
036816|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_093.wav|||There are a lot of unanswered questions.|
036817|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_094.wav|||Libya is an easy target.|
036818|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_095.wav|||I thought they played very well.|
036819|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_096.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
036820|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_097.wav|||It means they actually control the programme.|
036821|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_098.wav|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
036822|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_099.wav|||They chose to side with terror.|
036823|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_100.wav|||Justice was not seen today.|
036824|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_101.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
036825|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_102.wav|||Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|
036826|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_103.wav|||We should just say no.|
036827|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_104.wav|||We are not out of touch with politics.|
036828|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_105.wav|||That was a gold medal for certain.|
036829|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_106.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
036830|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_107.wav|||I didn't make those adjustments.|
036831|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_108.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
036832|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_109.wav|||We have it on video.|
036833|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_110.wav|||Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|
036834|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_111.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
036835|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_112.wav|||It didn't take long.|
036836|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_113.wav|||This meeting is the path to salvation.|
036837|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_114.wav|||Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|
036838|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_115.wav|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
036839|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_116.wav|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
036840|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_117.wav|||He told the conference.|
036841|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_118.wav|||The sanctions are about collective punishment.|
036842|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_119.wav|||We tend to come good at the end.|
036843|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_120.wav|||He also received a medal of honour.|
036844|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_121.wav|||It's not one for the purist.|
036845|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_122.wav|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
036846|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_123.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
036847|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_124.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
036848|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_125.wav|||There is bound to be a formal complaint.|
036849|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_126.wav|||It is a time bomb.|
036850|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_127.wav|||It's a matter of huge concern.|
036851|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_128.wav|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
036852|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_129.wav|||We are taking advice on this.|
036853|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_130.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
036854|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_131.wav|||It was just an accident of birth.|
036855|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_132.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
036856|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_133.wav|||It was a simple question.|
036857|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_134.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
036858|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_135.wav|||I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.|
036859|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_136.wav|||By that time, however, it was already too late.|

036861|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_138.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
036862|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_139.wav|||This is the New Edinburgh.|
036863|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_140.wav|||We all thought we were going to die.|
036864|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_141.wav|||And that's good news for the magpies.|
036865|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_142.wav|||That will come after the game on Saturday.|
036866|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_143.wav|||Our offer will remain on the table.|

036869|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_146.wav|||I would ask the fans to be patient.|
036870|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_147.wav|||It was so physical.|
036871|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_148.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
036872|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_149.wav|||He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.|
036873|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_150.wav|||Why is that?|
036874|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_151.wav|||It is extremely sad.|
036875|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_153.wav|||Europe is a hugely contentious issue.|
036876|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_154.wav|||It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|
036877|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_155.wav|||And therein lies the whole problem.|
036878|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_156.wav|||He was not deterred.|
036879|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_157.wav|||This commitment should be built upon.|
036880|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_158.wav|||This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|
036881|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_159.wav|||The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|
036882|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_160.wav|||That is not just my personal view.|
036883|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_161.wav|||The investment will be in the food.|
036884|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_162.wav|||But he was a full, working member of our staff.|
036885|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_163.wav|||The problem is the pitch.|
036886|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_164.wav|||That's as it should be.|
036887|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_165.wav|||It does seem a mystery.|
036888|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_166.wav|||Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|
036889|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_167.wav|||He looked very sharp.|
036890|334-en-m|en|wav/p334_168.wav|||The fate of large numbers remains unknown.|

037992|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037993|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037994|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037995|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
037996|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037997|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037998|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037999|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038000|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038001|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038002|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038003|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038004|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038005|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
038006|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038007|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038008|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038009|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
038010|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038011|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_025.wav|||They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|
038012|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_026.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|
038013|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_027.wav|||Glasgow is far from overload.|
038014|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_028.wav|||It's a big mystery.|
038015|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_029.wav|||What is a house without it?|
038016|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_030.wav|||It was really good in the first week.|
038017|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_031.wav|||It's about the balance.|
038018|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_032.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
038019|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_033.wav|||It really has not been their season.|
038020|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_034.wav|||I want somebody with something to prove.|
038021|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_035.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
038022|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_036.wav|||There was a ban on reporting the trial.|
038023|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_037.wav|||I don't think the action was a mistake.|
038024|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_038.wav|||You go in there and do it.|
038025|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_039.wav|||We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.|
038026|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_040.wav|||What will happen to them today?|
038027|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_041.wav|||I didn't expect to get one.|
038028|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_042.wav|||It was electric, amazing.|
038029|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_043.wav|||I said to him.|
038030|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_044.wav|||Labour has been found out on public spending.|

038033|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_047.wav|||The jury is still out on this one.|
038034|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_048.wav|||We have to work together.|
038035|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_049.wav|||I don't think that he won't be released.|
038036|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_050.wav|||It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|
038037|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_051.wav|||It means it is difficult.|
038038|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_052.wav|||But they were true stories.|
038039|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_053.wav|||I needed to get away.|
038040|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_054.wav|||I will make that point tonight.|
038041|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_055.wav|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|
038042|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_056.wav|||There are two things we have to do.|
038043|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_057.wav|||Are they going to work together again?|
038044|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_058.wav|||We need to do that every week.|
038045|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_059.wav|||It gives us something to work on.|
038046|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_060.wav|||But what did it matter?|
038047|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_061.wav|||A government is a government is a government.|
038048|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_062.wav|||Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.|

038051|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_065.wav|||It has affected it, obviously.|
038052|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_066.wav|||But that title is a mistake.|
038053|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_067.wav|||And he's not a bigot.|
038054|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_068.wav|||But summer is spent.|
038055|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_069.wav|||Services are being expanded, too.|
038056|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_070.wav|||It has only been rumours.|
038057|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_071.wav|||It is extremely fortunate.|
038058|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_072.wav|||Today is the first step in that process.|
038059|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_073.wav|||Several others were absent.|
038060|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_074.wav|||It is surprising to come back this way.|
038061|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_075.wav|||But there was no time for that.|
038062|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_076.wav|||A review is under way.|
038063|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_077.wav|||That should be fun.|

038068|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_082.wav|||I won't let that happen.|
038069|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_083.wav|||Or have they?|
038070|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_084.wav|||There is no change in the strategy.|
038071|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_085.wav|||I had a fortunate war.|
038072|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_086.wav|||It will probably be my last, too.|
038073|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_087.wav|||I am not completely insane.|
038074|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_088.wav|||We spoke about a few people.|
038075|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_089.wav|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
038076|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_090.wav|||In fact, he took it very well.|
038077|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_091.wav|||I decided to take my time.|
038078|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_092.wav|||Quite a lot of people know that, actually.|
038079|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_093.wav|||We did it in one take.|
038080|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_094.wav|||He doesn't even know who he is.|
038081|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_095.wav|||It is hard to understand.|
038082|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_096.wav|||What will it be?|
038083|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_097.wav|||The search is due to be completed today.|
038084|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_098.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|

038090|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_104.wav|||It was a disaster.|
038091|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_105.wav|||We have been so lucky.|
038092|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_107.wav|||It was a bit of a tightrope.|
038093|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_108.wav|||I don't know what we're doing wrong.|
038094|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_109.wav|||It was all over now.|
038095|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_110.wav|||But it was only a matter of time.|
038096|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_111.wav|||I always liked to get a laugh.|
038097|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_112.wav|||I still hope to go.|
038098|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_113.wav|||Sometimes they come off.|
038099|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_114.wav|||We're not that bad.|
038100|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_115.wav|||Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.|
038101|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_116.wav|||I feel strongly about it.|
038102|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_117.wav|||There are exciting days ahead.|
038103|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_118.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
038104|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_119.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
038105|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_120.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
038106|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_121.wav|||We're very, very happy.|
038107|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_122.wav|||There could be a possible connection.|
038108|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_123.wav|||But there was everything!|
038109|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_124.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
038110|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_125.wav|||The Scots are great.|
038111|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_126.wav|||That imbalance was evident in their play.|
038112|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_127.wav|||However, the drama was not over.|
038113|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_128.wav|||But it was not just the land.|
038114|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_129.wav|||I don't think the referees are against us.|
038115|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_130.wav|||It is too much for me.|
038116|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_131.wav|||It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|
038117|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_132.wav|||We are still waiting.|
038118|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_133.wav|||It happened again yesterday.|
038119|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_134.wav|||He will be a major challenger next year.|
038120|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_135.wav|||That question was never asked.|
038121|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_136.wav|||I am not inclined to believe it.|
038122|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_137.wav|||It was on fire.|
038123|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_138.wav|||I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|
038124|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_139.wav|||How can they tell?|
038125|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_140.wav|||My ambition is to make the cut.|
038126|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_141.wav|||It will be for the committee to decide.|
038127|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_142.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
038128|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_143.wav|||Rangers must be winners, it says.|
038129|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_144.wav|||He was part of the family.|
038130|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_145.wav|||I certainly think it should be there.|
038131|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_146.wav|||But it does not matter.|
038132|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_147.wav|||Hopefully we can put in a performance.|
038133|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_148.wav|||Sadly, he has a point.|
038134|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_149.wav|||It was so sad.|
038135|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_150.wav|||Mind you, all was not lost.|
038136|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_151.wav|||We were extremely lucky.|
038137|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_152.wav|||It was an amazing time.|
038138|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_153.wav|||In fact, the reasons are simple.|
038139|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_154.wav|||The hearing is expected to continue today.|
038140|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_155.wav|||It is just a matter of time.|
038141|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_156.wav|||This news is really depressing.|
038142|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_157.wav|||I'm not fit for anything else.|
038143|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_158.wav|||The day may come, but not for a while.|
038144|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_159.wav|||The enemy was time.|
038145|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_160.wav|||He would have done the same to me.|
038146|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_161.wav|||What were they told?|
038147|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_162.wav|||More cases are expected.|
038148|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_163.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
038149|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_164.wav|||It would be very dangerous.|
038150|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_165.wav|||How can they say that?|
038151|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_166.wav|||My condition is not bad.|
038152|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_167.wav|||Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.|
038153|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_168.wav|||I would like to make an impact, of course.|
038154|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_169.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
038155|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_170.wav|||The goal is clear.|
038156|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_171.wav|||Just think about the lines.|
038157|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_172.wav|||It all depends on the wind.|
038158|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_173.wav|||I was very influenced by him.|
038159|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_174.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
038160|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_175.wav|||This was much worse.|
038161|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_176.wav|||This was certainly not about money.|
038162|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_177.wav|||It is simple, but profound.|
038163|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_178.wav|||The funding is now there.|
038164|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_179.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
038165|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_180.wav|||A film is different from a book.|
038166|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_181.wav|||Within three days he was dead.|
038167|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_182.wav|||You'll find out on Saturday.|
038168|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_183.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
038169|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_184.wav|||We know that from recent experience.|
038170|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_185.wav|||From day one, we were a family.|
038171|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_186.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
038172|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_187.wav|||This could be wonderful.|
038173|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_188.wav|||He loved it, and so did they.|
038174|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_189.wav|||The other was a football match.|
038175|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_190.wav|||They have the players to do it.|
038176|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_191.wav|||Which is worse?|
038177|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_192.wav|||He has made a step forward.|
038178|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_193.wav|||That was very important.|
038179|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_194.wav|||This will have to change.|
038180|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_195.wav|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
038181|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_196.wav|||It was a very strong metaphor.|
038182|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_197.wav|||We are going to have a party.|
038183|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_198.wav|||I have no problem with that.|
038184|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_199.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
038185|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_200.wav|||I'm very happy that it exploded.|
038186|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_201.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
038187|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_202.wav|||Lester was like that.|
038188|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_203.wav|||Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.|
038189|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_204.wav|||That's a matter for them.|
038190|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_205.wav|||We were never told it was already decided.|
038191|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_206.wav|||It is part of our heritage.|
038192|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_207.wav|||It is not a road of life.|
038193|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_208.wav|||It is not as simple as that.|
038194|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_209.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
038195|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_210.wav|||Find them somebody they deserve.|
038196|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_211.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
038197|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_212.wav|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
038198|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_213.wav|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
038199|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_214.wav|||We're not getting involved.|
038200|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_215.wav|||The lottery has helped.|
038201|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_216.wav|||They know the language.|
038202|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_217.wav|||The acting left a lot to be desired.|
038203|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_218.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
038204|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_219.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
038205|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_220.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
038206|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_221.wav|||You cannot do that in a lobby.|
038207|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_222.wav|||We will all suffer as a result.|
038208|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_223.wav|||Without doubt, they can win the title.|
038209|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_224.wav|||What's it about?|
038210|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_225.wav|||We are looking to the future.|
038211|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_226.wav|||The signs are positive.|
038212|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_227.wav|||I called it right.|
038213|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_228.wav|||I see it as my job.|
038214|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_229.wav|||I have always believed in myself.|
038215|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_230.wav|||It has to be put in context.|
038216|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_231.wav|||I think we can get there.|
038217|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_232.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
038218|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_233.wav|||No, they have played well.|
038219|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_234.wav|||The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|
038220|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_235.wav|||The answer is obviously no.|
038221|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_236.wav|||I'll take it as it comes.|
038222|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_237.wav|||I think we're the better side.|
038223|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_238.wav|||We act because we must.|
038224|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_239.wav|||There are two mysteries.|
038225|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_240.wav|||The teacher would have approved.|
038226|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_241.wav|||Are you going to win?|
038227|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_242.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
038228|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_243.wav|||I could have been killed on that day.|
038229|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_244.wav|||They have to come up with a solution.|
038230|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_245.wav|||It is very enjoyable.|
038231|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_246.wav|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
038232|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_247.wav|||Did it work?|
038233|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_248.wav|||But that is for another day.|
038234|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_249.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
038235|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_250.wav|||It was not like that at all.|
038236|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_251.wav|||Police are appealing for witnesses.|
038237|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_252.wav|||I was very surprised.|
038238|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_253.wav|||We all knew they could do it.|
038239|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_254.wav|||It's about taking risks.|
038240|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_255.wav|||Why is this?|
038241|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_256.wav|||He is due in Israel tomorrow.|
038242|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_257.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
038243|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_258.wav|||There are not too many like him.|
038244|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_259.wav|||The memory is there.|
038245|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_260.wav|||It was an amazing experience.|
038246|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_261.wav|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
038247|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_262.wav|||He will go on the bench.|
038248|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_263.wav|||The police are hopeless.|
038249|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_264.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
038250|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_265.wav|||We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|
038251|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_266.wav|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
038252|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_267.wav|||That's the important thing.|
038253|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_268.wav|||Should he resign?|
038254|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_269.wav|||They have to live with the risk.|
038255|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_270.wav|||It is, but that's not the point.|
038256|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_271.wav|||It was my whole life.|
038257|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_272.wav|||It was a classic.|
038258|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_273.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
038259|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_274.wav|||However, it is going to happen.|
038260|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_275.wav|||This time it really could happen.|
038261|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_276.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
038262|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_277.wav|||That includes the equipment?|
038263|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_278.wav|||It does nothing for me.|
038264|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_279.wav|||That has been lost.|
038265|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_280.wav|||But that's another story.|
038266|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_281.wav|||I think it has worked.|
038267|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_282.wav|||No other family members could be contacted.|
038268|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_283.wav|||There is nothing to be gained from that.|
038269|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_284.wav|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
038270|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_285.wav|||But do not rely on it.|
038271|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_286.wav|||I made a mistake.|
038272|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_287.wav|||What do you want.|
038273|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_288.wav|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
038274|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_289.wav|||I think we could do well in Europe.|
038275|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_290.wav|||And yet, there has been no great impact.|
038276|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_291.wav|||Was that not awful?|
038277|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_292.wav|||Yesterday was a statement of intent.|
038278|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_293.wav|||I'm not there yet but it is close.|
038279|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_294.wav|||But it will not work again.|
038280|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_295.wav|||Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|
038281|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_296.wav|||I have nothing to say on that.|
038282|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_297.wav|||The rest is his own.|
038283|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_298.wav|||I have no worry about that.|
038284|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_299.wav|||There has been a fair bit in between, too.|
038285|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_300.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
038286|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_301.wav|||It turned out to have been three hours.|
038287|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_302.wav|||That is exactly right.|
038288|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_303.wav|||That is not good for golf!|
038289|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_304.wav|||He had planned to sell it.|
038290|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_305.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
038291|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_306.wav|||But it did not last.|
038292|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_307.wav|||They need to look after themselves.|
038293|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_308.wav|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
038294|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_309.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
038295|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_310.wav|||We have nothing to lose.|
038296|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_311.wav|||The first time it was rejected.|
038297|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_312.wav|||He did not report it.|
038298|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_313.wav|||No-one can take it in.|
038299|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_314.wav|||They were following his orders.|
038300|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_315.wav|||That is an entirely different discipline.|
038301|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_316.wav|||It was an insult.|
038302|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_317.wav|||Yet there is hope.|
038303|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_318.wav|||Referees in Scotland are very weak.|
038304|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_319.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
038305|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_320.wav|||That was a fairy tale.|
038306|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_321.wav|||I would love to do that.|
038307|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_322.wav|||You'll have to wait and see.|
038308|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_323.wav|||It wasn't the issue.|
038309|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_324.wav|||The number never came.|
038310|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_325.wav|||I really have to go now.|
038311|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_326.wav|||We are going to listen to Britain.|
038312|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_327.wav|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
038313|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_328.wav|||Words are not enough.|
038314|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_329.wav|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
038315|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_330.wav|||We have expected it.|
038316|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_331.wav|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
038317|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_332.wav|||Well, that was the plan.|
038318|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_333.wav|||The problem is fairly serious.|
038319|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_334.wav|||No decisions have been taken.|
038320|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_335.wav|||We won't do that.|
038321|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_336.wav|||It's the body that counts.|
038322|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_337.wav|||Sprinters are not fit.|
038323|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_338.wav|||This has been coming for weeks and weeks.|
038324|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_339.wav|||It's a double whammy.|
038325|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_340.wav|||Charges against the pair were found not proven.|
038326|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_341.wav|||Let's not make that mistake again.|
038327|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_342.wav|||That's why he is the prime minister.|
038328|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_343.wav|||Only injury has prevented that happening before.|
038329|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_344.wav|||They have to be dealt with.|
038330|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_345.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
038331|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_346.wav|||So what was he really doing?|
038332|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_347.wav|||I don't want to go anywhere.|
038333|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_348.wav|||How do we get a bigger stage?|
038334|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_349.wav|||We're very close to being a good team.|
038335|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_350.wav|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
038336|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_351.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
038337|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_352.wav|||My mind is the most important thing now.|
038338|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_353.wav|||I had nothing to lose.|
038339|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_354.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
038340|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_355.wav|||I thought to myself.|
038341|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_356.wav|||Could it be?|
038342|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_357.wav|||We're talking to the US.|
038343|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_358.wav|||Thereafter they were again in control.|
038344|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_359.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
038345|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_360.wav|||You have to keep the focus alive.|
038346|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_361.wav|||It could have been a ceilidh.|
038347|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_362.wav|||I cannot really commit.|
038348|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_363.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
038349|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_364.wav|||Sadly, so did a couple of errors.|
038350|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_365.wav|||This is a new beginning.|
038351|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_366.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
038352|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_367.wav|||They will fight for everything.|
038353|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_368.wav|||He is doing just that.|
038354|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_369.wav|||The night is young.|
038355|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_370.wav|||But there are signs of a revival.|
038356|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_371.wav|||I thought it was a great game.|
038357|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_372.wav|||Just get on with it.|
038358|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_373.wav|||Germany also said it was unimpressed.|
038359|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_374.wav|||It shows the Government is listening.|
038360|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_375.wav|||She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|
038361|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_376.wav|||They want it to work.|
038362|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_377.wav|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
038363|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_378.wav|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
038364|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_379.wav|||It decided to blame the media.|
038365|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_380.wav|||We have chosen for the patients.|
038366|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_381.wav|||He was at the outset of his career.|
038367|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_382.wav|||Our position is quite clear.|
038368|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_383.wav|||It could now be up to the courts.|
038369|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_384.wav|||We can make a difference.|
038370|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_385.wav|||This was not a contest.|
038371|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_386.wav|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038372|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_387.wav|||Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|
038373|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_388.wav|||I cannot describe it.|
038374|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_389.wav|||It is not designed to kill.|
038375|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_390.wav|||He has run a hell of a race.|
038376|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_391.wav|||We'll have to be satisfied with it.|
038377|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_392.wav|||Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.|
038378|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_393.wav|||It is good football in Scotland.|
038379|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_394.wav|||There is no other option.|
038380|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_395.wav|||You can feel the tension in the air.|
038381|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_396.wav|||It is a technique.|
038382|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_397.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
038383|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_398.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
038384|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_399.wav|||It is about more than Scotland.|
038385|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_400.wav|||It's not just going to be busy.|
038386|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_401.wav|||She was on the edge of breaking point.|
038387|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_402.wav|||The first appeared to be successful.|
038388|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_403.wav|||She was so supportive.|
038389|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_404.wav|||I'm delighted with our performance.|
038390|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_405.wav|||We await a decision.|
038391|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_406.wav|||It's a matter of balance.|
038392|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_407.wav|||It is an investment in our product.|
038393|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_408.wav|||Everyone can have their opinion.|
038394|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_409.wav|||What would you ask?|
038395|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_410.wav|||We have got to deal with it.|
038396|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_411.wav|||Where do we spend it?|
038397|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_412.wav|||I don't know how she does it.|
038398|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_413.wav|||I saw it later in the news.|
038399|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_414.wav|||Now we must look to the future.|
038400|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_415.wav|||I didn't play badly.|
038401|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_416.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
038402|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_417.wav|||They are looking for partners.|
038403|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_418.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
038404|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_419.wav|||We should have been rewarded for producing.|
038405|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_420.wav|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
038406|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_421.wav|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
038407|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_422.wav|||There is no shortage of questions.|
038408|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_423.wav|||Couldn't see the point.|
038409|339-en-f|en|wav/p339_424.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
038833|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
038834|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
038835|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
038836|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
038837|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
038838|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
038839|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038840|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038841|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038842|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038843|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038844|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038845|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|
038846|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038847|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038848|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038849|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038850|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038851|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
038852|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038853|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038854|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038855|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
038856|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038857|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_025.wav|||This guy is never going to give up.|
038858|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_026.wav|||That's interesting to me.|
038859|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_027.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|
038860|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_028.wav|||It is only one night, after all.|
038861|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_029.wav|||The injuries are not too serious.|
038862|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_030.wav|||Gilbert was not amused.|
038863|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_031.wav|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
038864|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_032.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
038865|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_033.wav|||Everything was up for grabs.|
038866|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_034.wav|||It's easy to see why.|
038867|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_035.wav|||I am proud of moments like that.|
038868|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_036.wav|||That was no surprise to me.|
038869|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_037.wav|||This has been blown out of all proportion.|
038870|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_038.wav|||There is no escape.|
038871|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_039.wav|||It's wonderful to have won.|
038872|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_040.wav|||Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.|
038873|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_041.wav|||He was arrested, but later released without charge.|
038874|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_042.wav|||I fell into it by accident.|
038875|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_043.wav|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
038876|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_044.wav|||This is a big advantage.|
038877|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_045.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
038878|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_046.wav|||Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|
038879|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_047.wav|||If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.|
038880|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_048.wav|||All the lads are totally focused on that.|
038881|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_049.wav|||Today is not about contracts.|
038882|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_050.wav|||That says something for his strength of character.|
038883|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_051.wav|||We are going for it.|
038884|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_052.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
038885|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_053.wav|||It's to do with play.|
038886|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_054.wav|||However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|
038887|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_055.wav|||I've just got to do this.|
038888|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_056.wav|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|
038889|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_057.wav|||So the process was refined.|
038890|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_058.wav|||Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.|
038891|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_059.wav|||I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|
038892|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_060.wav|||I think it is a sensible change.|
038893|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_061.wav|||Sex is fun?|
038894|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_062.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
038895|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_063.wav|||He added, It's not a racial problem.|
038896|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_064.wav|||This is the crossroads.|
038897|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_065.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|
038898|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_066.wav|||He is pretty upset.|
038899|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_067.wav|||And who would argue with that?|
038900|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_068.wav|||Where is the human rights?|
038901|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_069.wav|||We must put a marker down.|
038902|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_070.wav|||The decision is an absolute disgrace.|
038903|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_071.wav|||Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.|
038904|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_072.wav|||It is time to give her a rest.|
038905|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_073.wav|||They had had time for little else.|
038906|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_074.wav|||The feeling is awesome.|
038907|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_075.wav|||We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|
038908|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_076.wav|||But there was a shift.|
038909|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_077.wav|||The settlement could run to millions.|
038910|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_078.wav|||It does not stop at the border.|
038911|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_079.wav|||We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|
038912|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_080.wav|||He released a half-dozen solo albums.|
038913|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_081.wav|||Robert is a special talent.|
038914|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_082.wav|||John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.|
038915|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_083.wav|||In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.|
038916|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_084.wav|||They are going to carry it through.|
038917|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_085.wav|||She added, It is a huge problem.|
038918|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_086.wav|||You can't keep them separate.|
038919|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_087.wav|||The composer therefore believes he can do it.|
038920|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_088.wav|||I still feel like a wee boy.|
038921|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_089.wav|||He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.|
038922|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_090.wav|||The feedback from audiences was just so positive.|
038923|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_091.wav|||It had a gigantic effect.|
038924|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_092.wav|||Israel has done very little until now.|
038925|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_093.wav|||Debate was impassioned and furious.|
038926|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_094.wav|||We are losing this war.|
038927|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_095.wav|||It's a difficult one to play.|
038928|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_096.wav|||The death rates are still as high.|
038929|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_097.wav|||We are seeing a Government in a hurry.|
038930|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_098.wav|||It is a great honour and a privilege.|
038931|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_099.wav|||We certainly will need to watch him.|
038932|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_100.wav|||I don't think it could be clearer.|
038933|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_101.wav|||That meant the search was unlawful.|
038934|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_102.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|
038935|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_103.wav|||People buy everything with cash.|
038936|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_104.wav|||We are trying to establish a date.|

038939|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_107.wav|||There was great support all round the route.|
038940|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_108.wav|||I was a bit nervous.|
038941|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_109.wav|||It was a bit of a struggle today.|
038942|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_110.wav|||It was love of Helen and the children.|
038943|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_111.wav|||If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?|
038944|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_112.wav|||I love this tournament.|
038945|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_113.wav|||This is thought to mean sometime next week.|

038947|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_115.wav|||The breakdown was much later in her life.|
038948|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_116.wav|||I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|
038949|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_117.wav|||Both managements are very supportive.|
038950|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_118.wav|||Whoever said that cannot have seen it.|
038951|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_119.wav|||He's delighted, too, with the new premises.|
038952|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_120.wav|||The choice is strictly personal.|
038953|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_121.wav|||We are going to go about our lives.|
038954|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_122.wav|||He had other things on his mind.|
038955|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_123.wav|||The lady is right.|
038956|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_124.wav|||I hadn't seen them in eight years.|
038957|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_125.wav|||Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.|
038958|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_126.wav|||The next few months will tell.|
038959|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_127.wav|||I'm so proud of my team.|
038960|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_128.wav|||It is crucial for both teams.|
038961|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_129.wav|||It ended as it began, in confusion.|
038962|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_130.wav|||I am now just a bit uneasy.|
038963|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_131.wav|||You can see their point.|
038964|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_132.wav|||Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.|
038965|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_133.wav|||There was no hint of bravado.|
038966|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_134.wav|||However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.|
038967|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_135.wav|||Yet he chose to do something different.|
038968|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_136.wav|||He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.|
038969|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_137.wav|||At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.|
038970|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_138.wav|||There were no casualties.|
038971|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_139.wav|||The case will now go to appeal.|
038972|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_140.wav|||They really did a great job.|
038973|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_141.wav|||A teacher is, really, about unity.|
038974|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_142.wav|||They are still going to be impulsive.|
038975|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_143.wav|||I love you so very much.|
038976|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_144.wav|||He is a very nice man.|
038977|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_145.wav|||The road was closed for several hours.|
038978|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_146.wav|||Their condition was described as stable.|
038979|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_147.wav|||There's a good chance of seeing something.|
038980|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_148.wav|||In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.|
038981|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_149.wav|||I had a tie in my hand.|
038982|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_150.wav|||Surrey police said no body had been found.|
038983|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_151.wav|||Sean Connery did not disappoint.|
038984|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_152.wav|||Such a city does not exist.|
038985|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_153.wav|||My aim is a top six finish.|
038986|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_154.wav|||He came in an army uniform.|
038987|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_155.wav|||We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.|
038988|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_156.wav|||It was to no avail.|
038989|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_157.wav|||Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|
038990|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_158.wav|||But my heart is in athletics.|
038991|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_159.wav|||That is in the very nature of farming.|
038992|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_160.wav|||You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.|
038993|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_161.wav|||These matters are now behind us.|
038994|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_162.wav|||I'm working on that.|
038995|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_163.wav|||I love the tradition of vaudeville.|
038996|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_164.wav|||It was then into overtime.|
038997|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_165.wav|||Most of the public are behind me.|
038998|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_166.wav|||The first eviction takes place on Sunday.|
038999|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_167.wav|||It really is a gift to the world.|
039000|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_168.wav|||Look at his last couple of records.|
039001|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_169.wav|||I am still very much a director.|
039002|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_170.wav|||We must not give in to bastards.|
039003|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_171.wav|||She may even appear in some more films.|
039004|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_172.wav|||In some cases, the nation should be grateful.|
039005|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_173.wav|||My house was shaking at the time.|
039006|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_174.wav|||They will know they deserve to be there.|
039007|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_175.wav|||Of course he is.|
039008|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_176.wav|||This is a very positive step forward.|
039009|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_177.wav|||This is a huge confidence boost.|
039010|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_178.wav|||They recorded their debut album in New York.|
039011|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_179.wav|||And does it?|
039012|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_180.wav|||The crackdown is launched today by the government.|
039013|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_181.wav|||That's how it worked in Bosnia.|
039014|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_182.wav|||Nobody ever knew it had happened.|
039015|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_183.wav|||She is a very lucky lady.|
039016|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_184.wav|||It's the whole season.|
039017|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_185.wav|||We've been there for seven years.|
039018|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_186.wav|||Promises were not kept.|
039019|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_187.wav|||His signature is his handwriting.|
039020|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_188.wav|||He admitted there were two aspects of fear.|
039021|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_189.wav|||I've already done that.|
039022|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_190.wav|||We are on the path of change.|

039024|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_192.wav|||Who is he?|
039025|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_193.wav|||It has to be a long-term commitment.|
039026|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_194.wav|||No such remedy has ever been pursued.|
039027|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_195.wav|||Felt good about it.|
039028|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_196.wav|||It also highlighted some local hero districts.|
039029|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_197.wav|||The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.|
039030|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_198.wav|||Why does she suddenly win everything now?|
039031|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_199.wav|||What's the big idea?|
039032|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_200.wav|||One season, they might do well.|
039033|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_201.wav|||It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.|
039034|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_202.wav|||NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.|
039035|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_203.wav|||Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.|
039036|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_204.wav|||It's up to their parents to choose.|
039037|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_205.wav|||I feel privileged to be here.|
039038|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_206.wav|||If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|
039039|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_207.wav|||She told me to apply for the crest.|
039040|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_208.wav|||Too much has already been said.|
039041|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_209.wav|||John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.|
039042|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_210.wav|||He explained to his audience.|
039043|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_211.wav|||I think the Government should pay for that.|
039044|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_212.wav|||I asked why he had come.|
039045|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_213.wav|||He was a soldier.|
039046|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_214.wav|||The budget was too low for that.|
039047|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_215.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
039048|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_216.wav|||It didn't get any better.|
039049|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_217.wav|||I'm a bit annoyed.|
039050|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_218.wav|||He doesn't like the Labour Party.|
039051|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_219.wav|||I am totally devoted to this job.|
039052|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_220.wav|||I just could not cope.|
039053|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_221.wav|||He asked me in a tolerance zone.|
039054|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_222.wav|||It is all one-sided.|
039055|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_223.wav|||I've been thinking about it for a year.|
039056|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_224.wav|||Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.|
039057|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_225.wav|||Here are some possible solutions.|
039058|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_226.wav|||That's the day job.|
039059|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_227.wav|||Glasgow is going to be open for business.|
039060|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_228.wav|||IT was a thoroughly modern affair.|
039061|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_229.wav|||I'm not saying he is finished.|
039062|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_230.wav|||That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.|
039063|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_231.wav|||He is well respected by his colleagues.|
039064|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_232.wav|||It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.|
039065|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_233.wav|||Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|
039066|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_234.wav|||I would have dropped out otherwise.|
039067|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_236.wav|||Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.|
039068|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_237.wav|||Mrs Anderson said this one was different.|
039069|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_238.wav|||We believe we have a strong case.|
039070|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_239.wav|||I lost it at the final whistle.|
039071|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_240.wav|||Bill is a mentor.|
039072|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_241.wav|||They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.|
039073|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_242.wav|||I think he has undergone a sea change.|
039074|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_243.wav|||One must hope not!|
039075|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_244.wav|||It was a big day.|
039076|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_245.wav|||What makes a house a home?|
039077|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_246.wav|||I think however, he was having a fit!|
039078|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_247.wav|||I live on the streets of Glasgow.|
039079|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_248.wav|||I will not be pressured.|
039080|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_249.wav|||It doesn't make sense.|
039081|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_250.wav|||I'll go back home and see my family.|
039082|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_251.wav|||He admitted the asylum system was not working.|
039083|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_252.wav|||Have we not had the rainy season already?|
039084|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_253.wav|||I have heard the stories from Scotland.|
039085|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_254.wav|||Sub Not Used, McKay.|
039086|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_255.wav|||Do not listen to them.|
039087|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_256.wav|||Mind you, who wouldn't?|
039088|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_257.wav|||That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?|
039089|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_258.wav|||He loves the big occasions.|
039090|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_259.wav|||Our system is archaic.|
039091|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_260.wav|||It was a tactical change.|
039092|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_261.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
039093|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_262.wav|||When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.|
039094|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_263.wav|||This time, there were no such rewards.|
039095|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_264.wav|||He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.|
039096|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_265.wav|||I gave him a way out, and he took it.|
039097|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_266.wav|||Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.|
039098|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_267.wav|||She became very good at it.|
039099|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_268.wav|||We don't have the credible evidence.|
039100|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_269.wav|||It's one up to the Scots.|
039101|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_270.wav|||I'm just doing artwork.|
039102|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_271.wav|||And we still have to pay his salary.|
039103|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_272.wav|||Also, he was flawed.|
039104|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_273.wav|||Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|
039105|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_274.wav|||So there's a double whammy.|
039106|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_275.wav|||I didn't have a trio.|
039107|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_276.wav|||Their three other children had died as infants.|
039108|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_277.wav|||That is a mark of what you are.|
039109|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_278.wav|||His wife Margaret was not in court.|
039110|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_279.wav|||Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|
039111|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_280.wav|||I hope my successor will do the same.|
039112|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_281.wav|||The manager knew me very well.|
039113|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_282.wav|||I have been totally taken aback by this.|
039114|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_283.wav|||Are you in this movie?|
039115|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_284.wav|||We've got a full house tonight.|
039116|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_285.wav|||If they don't, they won't get what they want.|
039117|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_286.wav|||The fans will support us.|
039118|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_287.wav|||Make sure you see it.|
039119|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_288.wav|||It has, however, been a long time coming.|
039120|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_289.wav|||We are aware of the two incidents.|
039121|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_290.wav|||We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.|
039122|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_291.wav|||It was just one of those things.|
039123|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_292.wav|||The whole team was rubbish.|
039124|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_293.wav|||Now we need to keep our heads up.|
039125|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_294.wav|||You've got it coming Kabul.|
039126|341-en-f|en|wav/p341_295.wav|||They must act now to tighten the rules.|

039708|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_079.wav|||He would have loved it.|
039709|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_080.wav|||We should be capable of managing it, though.|
039710|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_081.wav|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
039711|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_082.wav|||It is a freedom.|
039712|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_083.wav|||What happens next?|
039713|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_084.wav|||All our futures will already have been decided.|
039714|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_085.wav|||I would have been shot dead in bed.|
039715|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_086.wav|||He insisted that his staff were too.|
039716|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_087.wav|||They should come clean.|
039717|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_088.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
039718|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_089.wav|||I believe that so strongly.|
039719|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_090.wav|||That, though, is an old story.|
039720|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_091.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
039721|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_092.wav|||They don't work anymore anyway.|
039722|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_093.wav|||It's about time something was done about equipment.|
039723|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_094.wav|||It was a funny feeling.|
039724|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_095.wav|||He was at it again yesterday.|
039725|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_096.wav|||You can't go on forever.|
039726|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_097.wav|||So far this season this approach is working.|
039727|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_098.wav|||However, his involvement was instant.|
039728|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_099.wav|||It has to work.|
039729|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_100.wav|||It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|
039730|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_101.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
039731|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_102.wav|||There's something about being cut off.|
039732|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_103.wav|||This is his personal life.|
039733|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_104.wav|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
039734|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_105.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
039735|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_106.wav|||It's as eventful as it is momentous.|
039736|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_107.wav|||I was going to help with the dinner.|
039737|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_108.wav|||Would you pay to come and see it?|
039738|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_109.wav|||What are they like?|
039739|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_110.wav|||I would probably have to agree with him.|
039740|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_111.wav|||They were back in favour with the SAC.|
039741|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_112.wav|||He had a moustache.|
039742|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_113.wav|||I have been thinking about that this week.|
039743|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_114.wav|||Let's get it on.|
039744|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_115.wav|||Together they will attempt to express the whole.|
039745|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_116.wav|||Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.|
039746|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_117.wav|||It is really good news.|
039747|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_118.wav|||We just want a fair deal.|
039748|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_119.wav|||I'll just have to live with that.|
039749|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_120.wav|||Neither of them was badly hurt.|
039750|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_121.wav|||He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.|
039751|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_122.wav|||We wanted it left for a wee while.|
039752|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_123.wav|||At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|
039753|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_124.wav|||It is sad and frustrating.|
039754|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_125.wav|||Our intentions are real.|
039755|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_126.wav|||The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|
039756|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_127.wav|||Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.|
039757|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_128.wav|||She has left the island.|
039758|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_129.wav|||That will be the case on Tuesday.|
039759|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_130.wav|||As to rugby, well, no-one knows.|
039760|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_131.wav|||It certainly should not be used too often.|
039761|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_132.wav|||The whole matter is done and dusted.|
039762|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_133.wav|||I don't know where that one came from.|
039763|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_134.wav|||The shooting created panic in the street.|
039764|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_135.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
039765|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_136.wav|||Our destiny is in our own hands.|
039766|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_137.wav|||That's not fair to the supporters.|
039767|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_138.wav|||I was on my own.|
039768|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_139.wav|||They were part of our own family.|
039769|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_140.wav|||It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.|
039770|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_141.wav|||I don't have any perspective on it.|
039771|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_142.wav|||Scotland has lost a great man.|
039772|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_143.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
039773|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_144.wav|||In fact, they will not be disciplined.|
039774|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_145.wav|||His name has not been released.|
039775|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_146.wav|||For some, it was more painful than others.|
039776|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_147.wav|||It plainly does not work.|
039777|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_148.wav|||His words were not audible.|
039778|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_149.wav|||That's a huge amount.|
039779|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_150.wav|||See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.|
039780|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_151.wav|||It was even worse than at home.|
039781|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_152.wav|||I still think he will win.|
039782|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_153.wav|||But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|
039783|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_154.wav|||Normally it would be four minutes.|
039784|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_155.wav|||It may have been a cry for help.|
039785|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_156.wav|||But the damage had been done.|
039786|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_157.wav|||No, you couldn't make it up.|
039787|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_158.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
039788|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_159.wav|||However, he did not stay there very long.|
039789|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_160.wav|||And so they have.|
039790|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_161.wav|||I have a great respect for her.|
039791|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_162.wav|||I suggest a new plan.|
039792|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_163.wav|||IT takes the biscuit.|
039793|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_164.wav|||But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|
039794|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_165.wav|||We don't have a solution to the problem.|
039795|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_166.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
039796|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_167.wav|||The result is utterly compelling.|
039797|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_168.wav|||But it won't be the same.|
039798|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_169.wav|||Other forces were, however, at work.|
039799|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_170.wav|||Inspiring public confidence is crucial.|
039800|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_171.wav|||It is a hobby for me.|
039801|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_172.wav|||If only the acting profession was that simple.|
039802|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_173.wav|||It was like a kick in the belly.|
039803|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_174.wav|||Bombing is the easy option.|
039804|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_175.wav|||We should have gone solo.|
039805|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_176.wav|||Directing, if you like.|
039806|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_177.wav|||That will be the case.|
039807|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_178.wav|||Now, it's all right.|
039808|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_179.wav|||All will be revealed in due course.|
039809|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_180.wav|||They have known the hard times.|
039810|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_181.wav|||We don't know what happened.|
039811|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_182.wav|||You cannot enter the clubhouse.|
039812|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_183.wav|||They had seven children.|
039813|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_184.wav|||That in itself is an erotic experience.|
039814|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_185.wav|||Death is outside the language.|
039815|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_186.wav|||You have a plan?|
039816|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_187.wav|||It's all too early.|
039817|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_188.wav|||Everything in the world was focused on London.|
039818|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_189.wav|||We've seen that time and time again.|
039819|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_190.wav|||I was never alone with her, right?|
039820|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_191.wav|||It's not only my respect for them.|
039821|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_192.wav|||Tonight's matches European Championship.|
039822|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_193.wav|||This is a very high price.|
039823|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_194.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
039824|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_195.wav|||I never want to have any children.|
039825|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_196.wav|||Business has never been so bad.|
039826|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_197.wav|||There is no way to do this.|
039827|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_198.wav|||Edinburgh was not included in the survey.|
039828|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_199.wav|||I know my sons.|
039829|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_200.wav|||Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|
039830|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_201.wav|||It was too close to call.|
039831|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_202.wav|||But who is the killer?|
039832|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_203.wav|||No, it's never been mentioned.|
039833|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_204.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
039834|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_205.wav|||The devil, of course, will be in the detail.|
039835|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_206.wav|||Then another one came.|
039836|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_207.wav|||Progress is being made but it is slow.|
039837|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_208.wav|||Everything has been destroyed.|
039838|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_209.wav|||The Lobby is not failing.|
039839|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_210.wav|||But it is looking very positive.|
039840|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_211.wav|||Drugs are getting through.|
039841|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_212.wav|||He would have come into the house.|
039842|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_213.wav|||I want to put myself on discussion also.|
039843|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_214.wav|||It happens in real life.|
039844|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_215.wav|||At the time, he was a living legend.|
039845|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_216.wav|||And we will do it.|
039846|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_217.wav|||It's a human tragedy.|
039847|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_218.wav|||But we are losing that connection.|
039848|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_219.wav|||I am going to fight to the end.|
039849|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_220.wav|||Either group is living in fantasy land.|
039850|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_221.wav|||It's the right thing.|
039851|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_222.wav|||That was a disgraceful performance.|
039852|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_223.wav|||Must have been at the bar.|
039853|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_224.wav|||But this is just the start.|
039854|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_225.wav|||I can't get away from it.|
039855|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_226.wav|||I believe in the Union.|
039856|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_227.wav|||SCOTLAND has shown the way.|
039857|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_228.wav|||But he is not hopeful.|
039858|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_229.wav|||It will be all about the Olympics.|
039859|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_230.wav|||They are very frightened.|
039860|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_231.wav|||We have all been there at some point.|
039861|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_232.wav|||This is my homeland.|
039862|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_233.wav|||The game was up.|
039863|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_234.wav|||That is not an easy thing.|
039864|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_235.wav|||Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|
039865|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_236.wav|||I didn't know where they were.|
039866|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_237.wav|||Rangers are my life.|
039867|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_238.wav|||Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.|
039868|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_239.wav|||Three weeks later, he resigned.|
039869|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_240.wav|||There are two options.|
039870|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_241.wav|||I can't describe it.|
039871|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_242.wav|||Surely it should be the other way round.|
039872|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_243.wav|||There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|
039873|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_244.wav|||I get on him, he gets on me.|
039874|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_245.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
039875|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_246.wav|||I am appalled by this news.|
039876|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_247.wav|||No injuries were reported.|
039877|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_248.wav|||It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|
039878|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_249.wav|||It is understood he had been stabbed.|
039879|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_250.wav|||It's too much work.|
039880|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_251.wav|||We were extremely arrogant.|
039881|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_252.wav|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|
039882|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_253.wav|||THE waiting game continues.|
039883|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_254.wav|||Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|
039884|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_255.wav|||I don't think he was being very fair.|
039885|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_256.wav|||You've got to fight to stay up.|
039886|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_257.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
039887|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_258.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
039888|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_259.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
039889|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_260.wav|||What is so unusual about this case?|
039890|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_261.wav|||Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.|
039891|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_262.wav|||But this is different.|
039892|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_263.wav|||I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|
039893|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_264.wav|||It doesn't look good.|
039894|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_265.wav|||That will not change.|
039895|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_267.wav|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
039896|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_268.wav|||Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.|
039897|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_269.wav|||It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.|
039898|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_270.wav|||There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.|
039899|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_271.wav|||They've been at it for five hours.|
039900|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_272.wav|||This action could have been avoided.|
039901|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_273.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
039902|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_274.wav|||And they still have the final to come.|
039903|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_275.wav|||Anyone else can apply.|
039904|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_276.wav|||He looked like a schoolboy.|
039905|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_277.wav|||It was like the old days.|
039906|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_278.wav|||But that is about to change.|
039907|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_279.wav|||The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.|
039908|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_280.wav|||We can build on that.|
039909|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_281.wav|||It could be a danger.|
039910|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_282.wav|||We are not going to be complacent.|
039911|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_283.wav|||The only problem was, they were on himself.|
039912|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_284.wav|||His body was found in May.|
039913|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_285.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
039914|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_286.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|
039915|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_287.wav|||I'm sure you all can relate to that.|
039916|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_288.wav|||My wife is coming over at the weekend.|
039917|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_289.wav|||Sure, he is the best player in the world.|
039918|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_290.wav|||It starts to get you down.|
039919|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_291.wav|||I don't think we could have expected better.|
039920|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_292.wav|||My life has been turned upside down.|
039921|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_293.wav|||Somebody has to speak up for common sense.|
039922|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_294.wav|||But they miss the whole point.|
039923|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_295.wav|||You have to count on other people.|
039924|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_296.wav|||I said, What was that about?|
039925|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_297.wav|||Immediate action must be taken.|
039926|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_298.wav|||This could prove a problem.|
039927|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_299.wav|||I was a local hero.|
039928|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_300.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
039929|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_301.wav|||It will be extremely difficult for him.|
039930|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_302.wav|||It's a gigantic con.|
039931|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_303.wav|||Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|
039932|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_304.wav|||This club have been fair to me.|
039933|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_305.wav|||I didn't know she could do that.|
039934|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_306.wav|||What does she consider her greatest achievement?|
039935|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_307.wav|||This is too much like Scotland.|
039936|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_308.wav|||I can't say anything about any figure.|
039937|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_309.wav|||A counter reaction was.|
039938|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_310.wav|||That goes back a long way.|
039939|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_311.wav|||I wouldn't have had the abandon.|
039940|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_312.wav|||She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|
039941|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_313.wav|||They were not missing much.|
039942|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_314.wav|||It should not make the same mistake again.|
039943|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_315.wav|||Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|
039944|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_316.wav|||The record companies have gone through the floor.|
039945|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_317.wav|||It's always a dilemma.|
039946|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_318.wav|||As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.|
039947|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_319.wav|||Is she in trouble?|
039948|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_320.wav|||It is a symbolic concert.|
039949|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_321.wav|||They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|
039950|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_322.wav|||It is a very beautiful city.|
039951|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_323.wav|||She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|
039952|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_324.wav|||But could it afford to run it?|
039953|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_325.wav|||I am very happy with him.|
039954|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_326.wav|||I was waiting for that question.|
039955|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_327.wav|||Her body was found on Monday morning.|
039956|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_328.wav|||I am not against a further inquiry.|
039957|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_329.wav|||His father said, My son was lucky.|
039958|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_330.wav|||WHO would have thought it?|
039959|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_331.wav|||We will win the argument.|
039960|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_332.wav|||Five years later, the deception continued.|
039961|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_333.wav|||I might get an injury very easily.|
039962|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_334.wav|||I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|
039963|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_335.wav|||Stock markets will be watching closely.|
039964|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_336.wav|||I just want to do the good work.|
039965|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_337.wav|||I'm very happy tonight.|
039966|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_338.wav|||He was overwhelmed by the response.|
039967|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_339.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
039968|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_340.wav|||Now it was serious.|
039969|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_341.wav|||This is his first movie.|
039970|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_342.wav|||He is already in place.|
039971|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_343.wav|||No one would believe him.|
039972|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_344.wav|||We live in shorthand.|
039973|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_345.wav|||But something has been lost in the translation.|
039974|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_346.wav|||Spent three months alone at sea.|
039975|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_347.wav|||I made a big mistake.|
039976|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_348.wav|||I just know it's a lot.|
039977|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_349.wav|||I saw one body.|
039978|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_350.wav|||I am very happy.|
039979|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_351.wav|||There was no discussion about it.|
039980|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_352.wav|||Three hours later, the man was free.|
039981|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_353.wav|||It was a very big win for us.|
039982|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_354.wav|||I've never felt affection for Emu.|
039983|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_355.wav|||Everything is up for grabs.|
039984|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_356.wav|||We had a good time.|
039985|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_357.wav|||I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.|
039986|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_358.wav|||This was a good performance.|
039987|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_359.wav|||However, the snow was welcomed by some.|
039988|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_360.wav|||It is not simple.|
039989|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_361.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
039990|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_362.wav|||Our task is to complete the picture.|
039991|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_363.wav|||It is a road of death.|
039992|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_364.wav|||The Government would be ready, they said.|
039993|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_365.wav|||Her life is now back on track.|
039994|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_366.wav|||I said at the time it was wrong.|
039995|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_367.wav|||By now he was very ill with cancer.|
039996|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_368.wav|||Anything that was going, really.|
039997|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_369.wav|||He will take it in his stride.|
039998|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_370.wav|||I don't believe a word of it.|
039999|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_371.wav|||I couldn't put my finger on it.|
040000|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_372.wav|||People can really get themselves in a mess.|
040001|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_373.wav|||The winner will be announced in December.|
040002|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_374.wav|||This is bound to happen.|
040003|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_375.wav|||Suddenly, there was an audience.|
040004|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_376.wav|||It has not yet opened to pupils.|
040005|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_377.wav|||The letters are going out today.|
040006|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_378.wav|||I did not name it.|
040007|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_379.wav|||And therein lies the problem.|
040008|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_380.wav|||I also thought, This is a feature film.|
040009|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_381.wav|||McMaster had already seen the first part.|
040010|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_382.wav|||Or is it?|
040011|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_383.wav|||Is he going to look after them?|
040012|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_384.wav|||They are appealing for witnesses.|
040013|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_385.wav|||This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.|
040014|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_386.wav|||It is quite simple.|
040015|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_389.wav|||It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|
040016|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_390.wav|||His instructions were clear.|
040017|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_391.wav|||There is ample evidence.|
040018|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_392.wav|||It was a game we had to win.|
040019|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_393.wav|||I've never had problems with any football managers.|
040020|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_394.wav|||To begin with it looks good.|
040021|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_395.wav|||I won't go back to Holland.|
040022|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_396.wav|||There is still a long way to go.|
040023|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_397.wav|||Almost overnight, he found his voice.|
040024|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_398.wav|||This was a unique election.|
040025|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_399.wav|||It was still there last night.|
040026|345-en-m|en|wav/p345_400.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
040873|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
040874|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040875|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040876|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040877|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040878|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040879|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040880|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040881|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040882|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040883|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040884|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040885|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040886|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040887|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040888|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040889|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040890|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040891|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040892|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040893|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040894|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040895|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040896|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040897|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_025.wav|||You can never take a win for granted.|
040898|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_026.wav|||My conscience is not clear.|
040899|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_027.wav|||Is that it?|
040900|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_028.wav|||You have been warned.|
040901|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_029.wav|||You are not allowed to do that.|
040902|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_030.wav|||That depends on Rangers.|
040903|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_031.wav|||There are two problems.|
040904|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_032.wav|||Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|
040905|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_033.wav|||It's something which is very important to me.|
040906|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_034.wav|||For once he was wrong.|
040907|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_035.wav|||He would not have to explain.|
040908|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_036.wav|||I want to deliver a learning society.|
040909|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_037.wav|||We are just happy that hasn't happened.|
040910|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_038.wav|||I had to be into it.|
040911|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_039.wav|||I'm so grateful for that.|
040912|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_040.wav|||It's not been a good year.|
040913|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_041.wav|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|
040914|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_042.wav|||I have no intention of resigning today.|
040915|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_043.wav|||That has now gone.|
040916|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_044.wav|||Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.|
040917|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_045.wav|||This will take up to nine months.|
040918|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_046.wav|||And maybe they have.|
040919|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_047.wav|||Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|
040920|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_048.wav|||Is he conscious?|
040921|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_049.wav|||But we are confident.|
040922|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_050.wav|||It is like a football team.|
040923|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_051.wav|||When he came to see me on Monday.|
040924|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_052.wav|||That's a concern to me.|
040925|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_053.wav|||She said she was really sorry.|
040926|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_054.wav|||That will be important.|
040927|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_055.wav|||But here it is also very bad.|
040928|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_056.wav|||That view has not altered.|
040929|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_057.wav|||It was very full anyway.|
040930|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_058.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
040931|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_059.wav|||The incidents are not believed to be linked.|
040932|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_060.wav|||But there is no easy option.|
040933|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_061.wav|||I can't believe she is dead.|
040934|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_062.wav|||No person was charged.|
040935|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_063.wav|||But it would say that.|
040936|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_064.wav|||Most of the works are small in scale.|
040937|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_065.wav|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
040938|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_066.wav|||Only the bomber was killed.|
040939|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_067.wav|||But he just carried on anyway.|
040940|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_068.wav|||Nor was it a game without its lessons.|
040941|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_069.wav|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
040942|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_070.wav|||His presence was very important.|
040943|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_071.wav|||What happens next?|
040944|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_072.wav|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
040945|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_073.wav|||The bombing begins in five minutes.|
040946|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_074.wav|||That took two weeks.|
040947|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_075.wav|||It's worth it, though.|
040948|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_076.wav|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
040949|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_077.wav|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
040950|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_078.wav|||The question was simple enough.|
040951|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_079.wav|||The voters rejected us.|
040952|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_080.wav|||There was a definite prejudice.|
040953|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_081.wav|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
040954|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_082.wav|||We never publicise it.|
040955|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_083.wav|||You will be very welcome.|
040956|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_084.wav|||His musicals were very much of their time.|
040957|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_085.wav|||He became enchanted with the process.|
040958|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_086.wav|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
040959|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_087.wav|||It seems very odd.|
040960|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_088.wav|||They couldn't keep it together.|
040961|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_089.wav|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
040962|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_090.wav|||We will continue to provide support for them.|
040963|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_091.wav|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
040964|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_092.wav|||It was looking bad.|
040965|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_093.wav|||That's what makes it interesting.|
040966|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_094.wav|||It's nice to be involved.|
040967|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_095.wav|||It's not a game.|
040968|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_096.wav|||Buildings are about people.|
040969|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_097.wav|||There is much work to do.|
040970|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_098.wav|||The release attracted little attention.|
040971|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_099.wav|||It was the dreaded sentence.|
040972|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_100.wav|||I have never considered it.|
040973|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_101.wav|||It is not in the public interest.|
040974|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_102.wav|||They had been forced to walk.|
040975|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_103.wav|||It is harder than you think.|
040976|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_104.wav|||The call was ignored.|
040977|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_105.wav|||I am looking forward to it.|
040978|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_106.wav|||Consumers will also benefit.|
040979|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_107.wav|||That would be even more disastrous.|
040980|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_108.wav|||We opened up and everything was gone.|
040981|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_109.wav|||It is looking very special.|
040982|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_110.wav|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
040983|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_111.wav|||People were hitting the floor.|
040984|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_112.wav|||She was close to suicide at one stage.|
040985|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_113.wav|||They took a risk.|
040986|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_114.wav|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
040987|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_115.wav|||It has no place in football.|
040988|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_116.wav|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
040989|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_117.wav|||This is a classic.|
040990|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_118.wav|||He played it like a veteran.|
040991|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_119.wav|||I have spoken to head office.|
040992|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_120.wav|||I'm not thinking about anyone else.|
040993|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_121.wav|||They will run a mile.|
040994|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_122.wav|||When she went off it was quite amazing.|
040995|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_123.wav|||Britain has never had it so good.|
040996|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_124.wav|||So many people will be affected by this.|
040997|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_125.wav|||It was all very good stuff.|
040998|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_126.wav|||Or was it?|
040999|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_127.wav|||We are under no illusions about this.|
041000|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_128.wav|||But they are a good team.|
041001|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_129.wav|||We have a long way to go.|
041002|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_130.wav|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
041003|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_131.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
041004|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_132.wav|||I knew that we needed to get out.|
041005|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_133.wav|||I had a train to catch.|
041006|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_134.wav|||And this game is all about belief.|
041007|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_135.wav|||I am ready for that.|
041008|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_136.wav|||It is a fantasy.|
041009|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_137.wav|||The only safe investment is cash.|
041010|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_138.wav|||That's the way they are.|
041011|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_139.wav|||Elections would follow in about two years.|
041012|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_140.wav|||We are trying to be realistic.|
041013|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_141.wav|||That was the theory.|
041014|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_142.wav|||Or so it seemed.|
041015|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_143.wav|||Now we look forward to it.|
041016|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_144.wav|||That was worth it.|
041017|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_145.wav|||What's it going to be then?|
041018|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_146.wav|||Who was being affected?|
041019|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_147.wav|||Our players are exhausted.|
041020|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_148.wav|||It is deeply frustrating.|
041021|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_149.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
041022|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_150.wav|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
041023|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_151.wav|||This has been carried out.|
041024|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_152.wav|||Our time is up.|
041025|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_153.wav|||It was a moment of madness.|
041026|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_154.wav|||But other Ministers are not convinced.|
041027|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_155.wav|||First meeting was next week.|
041028|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_156.wav|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|
041029|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_157.wav|||Conditions were very difficult for the players.|
041030|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_158.wav|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
041031|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_159.wav|||I didn't think we deserved to go out.|
041032|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_160.wav|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
041033|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_161.wav|||I told them they shouldn't say that.|
041034|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_162.wav|||I don't know how they do it.|
041035|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_163.wav|||Little is known about them.|
041036|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_164.wav|||It is a new company for Scotland.|
041037|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_165.wav|||We're very unhappy about it.|
041038|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_166.wav|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041039|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_167.wav|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
041040|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_168.wav|||It was extremely difficult.|
041041|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_169.wav|||It is about the script for me.|
041042|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_170.wav|||I have a good feeling about this.|
041043|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_171.wav|||And the results were impressive.|
041044|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_172.wav|||The next game is today.|
041045|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_173.wav|||Hopefully it will be a good day.|
041046|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_174.wav|||I was a silly bastard.|
041047|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_175.wav|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
041048|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_176.wav|||The process will start tomorrow.|
041049|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_177.wav|||Was the punishment excessive?|
041050|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_178.wav|||The police have an awful lot to explain.|
041051|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_179.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
041052|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_180.wav|||I could easy do that.|
041053|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_181.wav|||We are really impressed.|
041054|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_182.wav|||I try to be clear in the narrative.|
041055|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_183.wav|||You have to wait.|
041056|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_184.wav|||I did not see anything to begin with.|
041057|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_185.wav|||It's their moment of choice.|
041058|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_186.wav|||I certainly do not agree with that.|
041059|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_187.wav|||It was a disaster of a race.|
041060|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_188.wav|||Only one person can claim the credit.|
041061|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_189.wav|||Maintain the highest standards.|
041062|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_190.wav|||What could we do?|
041063|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_191.wav|||O Neill has delivered.|
041064|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_192.wav|||But there was no going back.|
041065|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_193.wav|||There are some good people in there.|
041066|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_194.wav|||But it won't make a difference.|
041067|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_195.wav|||I'm not going to blame the band.|
041068|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_196.wav|||I think that he got the message.|
041069|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_197.wav|||Here it was very subdued.|
041070|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_198.wav|||Stardom is a funny thing.|
041071|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_199.wav|||They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|
041072|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_200.wav|||The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|
041073|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_201.wav|||I sincerely hope not.|
041074|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_202.wav|||I'm really looking forward to that.|
041075|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_203.wav|||She would say he was still the best.|
041076|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_204.wav|||It is dangerous and it is a lie.|
041077|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_205.wav|||We didn't, and it worked for us.|
041078|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_206.wav|||No-one has used it since then.|
041079|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_207.wav|||The baby was dead.|
041080|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_208.wav|||That remains the unanswered question.|
041081|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_209.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
041082|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_210.wav|||They tried to give her advice.|
041083|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_211.wav|||We should have no more problems.|
041084|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_212.wav|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
041085|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_213.wav|||An announcement is expected soon.|
041086|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_214.wav|||It was one of those things.|
041087|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_215.wav|||I can understand that.|
041088|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_216.wav|||But sometimes it was even worse.|
041089|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_217.wav|||We had to work hard for it.|
041090|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_218.wav|||That's a big reduction.|
041091|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_219.wav|||There will be good prospects ahead.|
041092|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_220.wav|||I was pleased about that.|
041093|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_221.wav|||That has not changed.|
041094|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_222.wav|||It's a creative energy.|
041095|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_223.wav|||We are not conducting the review.|
041096|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_224.wav|||It just never comes together.|
041097|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_225.wav|||The club has never won it.|
041098|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_226.wav|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
041099|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_227.wav|||So it was at Easter Road.|
041100|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_228.wav|||It will be a huge difference.|
041101|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_229.wav|||Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|
041102|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_230.wav|||The characters are always the first attraction.|
041103|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_231.wav|||We've got better players here.|
041104|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_232.wav|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
041105|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_233.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
041106|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_234.wav|||So what's it all about?|
041107|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_235.wav|||I think he was lost for words.|
041108|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_236.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041109|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_237.wav|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
041110|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_238.wav|||This is a historic occasion.|
041111|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_239.wav|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
041112|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_240.wav|||And what happens?|
041113|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_241.wav|||It is all very upbeat.|
041114|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_242.wav|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
041115|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_243.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
041116|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_244.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
041117|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_245.wav|||We deserved the draw.|
041118|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_246.wav|||Just one of those things, we suppose.|
041119|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_247.wav|||It's up to the defence team.|
041120|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_248.wav|||No one was injured.|
041121|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_249.wav|||We have had our debate.|
041122|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_250.wav|||It is part of his game.|
041123|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_251.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
041124|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_252.wav|||But it was too late.|
041125|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_253.wav|||I didn't see the point.|
041126|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_254.wav|||It seems a shame to leave it.|
041127|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_255.wav|||Who would have thought it?|
041128|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_256.wav|||They were all on a mission.|
041129|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_257.wav|||Human beings are always the same.|
041130|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_258.wav|||You will gain from that.|
041131|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_259.wav|||It makes me feel difficult.|
041132|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_260.wav|||We couldn't believe it at first.|
041133|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_261.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
041134|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_262.wav|||He could still be President.|
041135|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_263.wav|||It can take a long time.|
041136|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_264.wav|||I don't intend to do so now.|
041137|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_265.wav|||There is no answer to it.|
041138|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_266.wav|||He was pleased with his display.|
041139|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_267.wav|||The first time you read a play.|
041140|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_268.wav|||There was no let-up for the minnows.|
041141|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_269.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
041142|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_270.wav|||He is having a nightmare.|
041143|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_271.wav|||That was six years ago.|
041144|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_272.wav|||Players have to accept this.|
041145|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_273.wav|||He is completely committed to us.|
041146|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_274.wav|||Neither had the public.|
041147|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_275.wav|||It disappeared into the cup.|
041148|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_276.wav|||They might well be right.|
041149|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_277.wav|||I have no further comment to make.|
041150|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_278.wav|||The warning is timely.|
041151|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_279.wav|||Those were the days.|
041152|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_280.wav|||The joint bid is still on course.|
041153|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_281.wav|||A press conference is about politics.|
041154|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_282.wav|||It was important to bring them all together.|
041155|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_283.wav|||We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|
041156|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_284.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
041157|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_285.wav|||These things happen in football but shouldn't.|
041158|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_286.wav|||It looks as though he will be right.|
041159|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_287.wav|||We know the fight is going to happen.|
041160|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_288.wav|||I have played well the past two days.|
041161|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_289.wav|||Is it on a building site?|
041162|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_290.wav|||That is the key.|
041163|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_291.wav|||We've been here before.|
041164|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_292.wav|||I am in a good position.|
041165|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_293.wav|||I have never been unemployed.|
041166|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_294.wav|||We are in it for the long-term.|
041167|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_295.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
041168|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_296.wav|||I believe it will happen.|
041169|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_297.wav|||And Michael was just great.|
041170|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_298.wav|||He did it well.|
041171|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_299.wav|||Why have you decided to get married?|
041172|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_300.wav|||Is it all real?|
041173|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_301.wav|||He will be missed.|
041174|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_302.wav|||I would not descend to that level.|
041175|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_303.wav|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
041176|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_304.wav|||We will not tolerate it.|
041177|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_305.wav|||I'm really proud of her.|
041178|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_306.wav|||What does this mean?|
041179|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_307.wav|||They are not falling now.|
041180|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_308.wav|||We are not physical at all.|
041181|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_309.wav|||Have we not been here before?|
041182|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_310.wav|||I've been waiting a long time.|
041183|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_311.wav|||The meaning is very profound and complex.|
041184|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_312.wav|||You just have to get on with it.|
041185|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_313.wav|||The response from everyone was wonderful.|
041186|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_314.wav|||And that match was played in June.|
041187|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_315.wav|||We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|
041188|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_316.wav|||I don't mean in a frightening way.|
041189|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_317.wav|||He is a sort of a mystery figure.|
041190|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_318.wav|||I have learned a lot.|
041191|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_319.wav|||It won't be their last.|
041192|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_320.wav|||You've got to have both sides.|
041193|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_321.wav|||He has yet to receive a reply.|
041194|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_322.wav|||It has been only average.|
041195|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_323.wav|||He should be worried about me.|
041196|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_324.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
041197|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_325.wav|||For me, any manager is good.|
041198|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_326.wav|||Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|
041199|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_327.wav|||That was the gimmick.|
041200|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_328.wav|||He refused to name the survivors.|
041201|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_329.wav|||He has changed my life forever.|
041202|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_330.wav|||I have no idea.|
041203|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_331.wav|||This plan is all about respect.|
041204|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_332.wav|||I don't think he played his best.|
041205|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_333.wav|||Pakistan denied the report.|
041206|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_334.wav|||It will be up to the government.|
041207|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_335.wav|||That is a tragedy.|
041208|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_336.wav|||I am very happy.|
041209|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_337.wav|||A child is not a product.|
041210|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_338.wav|||But this is nonsense.|
041211|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_339.wav|||You can't get the experience in Austria.|
041212|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_340.wav|||I'm going to miss it.|
041213|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_341.wav|||There will be no backing down.|
041214|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_342.wav|||The atmosphere was excellent.|
041215|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_343.wav|||That must have had an effect.|
041216|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_344.wav|||They have brought in the replacement.|
041217|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_345.wav|||How did it all come about?|
041218|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_346.wav|||We are working so hard.|
041219|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_347.wav|||One was a lawyer.|
041220|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_348.wav|||Our position is extremely simple.|
041221|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_349.wav|||Where did that finish?|
041222|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_350.wav|||I suppose it is quite exciting really.|
041223|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_351.wav|||The most important thing was to win today.|
041224|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_352.wav|||Golf is not like that.|
041225|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_353.wav|||This is a moment to seize.|
041226|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_354.wav|||I would not do that.|
041227|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_355.wav|||Lots of them haven't recovered that far.|
041228|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_356.wav|||They said that they stood by their statement.|
041229|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_357.wav|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
041230|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_358.wav|||That has to be allowed.|
041231|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_359.wav|||He has never let them down.|
041232|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_360.wav|||There was no-one of the required standard.|
041233|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_361.wav|||That would be very good for Rangers.|
041234|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_362.wav|||It's something he has worked very hard on.|
041235|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_363.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
041236|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_364.wav|||That gives it a spirit.|
041237|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_365.wav|||She has never been back.|
041238|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_366.wav|||It will set the tone.|
041239|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_367.wav|||They are not going away.|
041240|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_368.wav|||Having done it, he was asked again.|
041241|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_369.wav|||I think he will.|
041242|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_370.wav|||The package is a changing one.|
041243|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_371.wav|||I'm working on that one, too.|
041244|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_372.wav|||Frankly, that's not good enough.|
041245|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_373.wav|||Or is it?|
041246|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_374.wav|||What's the difference?|
041247|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_375.wav|||The whole family was in shock.|
041248|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_376.wav|||But everywhere the problems are the same.|
041249|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_377.wav|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
041250|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_378.wav|||The problems began a long time ago.|
041251|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_379.wav|||It meant a lot to us.|
041252|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_380.wav|||What other retailer would do this?|
041253|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_381.wav|||Other musicians were found in retirement.|
041254|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_382.wav|||This country has many challenges.|
041255|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_383.wav|||Their families are gone.|
041256|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_384.wav|||IS Tony Blair on drugs?|
041257|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_385.wav|||I didn't do it.|
041258|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_386.wav|||They are with their father.|
041259|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_387.wav|||They're all doing it.|
041260|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_388.wav|||I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|
041261|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_389.wav|||No, they are not the same thing.|
041262|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_390.wav|||In football it is not always the case.|
041263|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_391.wav|||Sometimes we find a person.|
041264|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_392.wav|||It is a natural reaction.|
041265|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_393.wav|||I am in a very difficult position.|
041266|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_394.wav|||I had to win this race.|
041267|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_395.wav|||They could have been told in advance.|
041268|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_396.wav|||And what do we have?|
041269|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_397.wav|||It is a relief.|
041270|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_398.wav|||The boat was fantastic.|
041271|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_399.wav|||These were the edited highlights.|
041272|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_400.wav|||That is the difference.|
041273|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_401.wav|||You will need it.|
041274|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_402.wav|||There is so much at stake.|
041275|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_403.wav|||It has great potential.|
041276|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_404.wav|||They had three children.|
041277|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_405.wav|||It was all too little, too late.|
041278|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_406.wav|||Still, it is a very good result for us.|
041279|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_407.wav|||And he's not alone.|
041280|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_408.wav|||What was all that about?|
041281|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_409.wav|||What's the problem with change?|
041282|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_410.wav|||I intend to end it on a high.|
041283|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_411.wav|||What she can't have is the money.|
041284|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_412.wav|||I thought they played well.|
041285|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_413.wav|||This is not the end.|
041286|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_414.wav|||And they went on to win the title.|
041287|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_415.wav|||Now, she will not be running at all.|
041288|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_416.wav|||It's not an impression.|
041289|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_417.wav|||This was great for our sport.|
041290|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_418.wav|||There's no place to hide.|
041291|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_419.wav|||I don't think they are too serious.|
041292|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_420.wav|||Tiger is the exception.|
041293|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_421.wav|||There was no happy ending.|
041294|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_422.wav|||They need time to think.|
041295|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_423.wav|||It's unfair on her.|
041296|360-en-m|en|wav/p360_424.wav|||As for Owen, class is permanent.|
041297|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
041298|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
041299|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041300|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041301|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041302|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041303|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041304|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041305|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041306|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041307|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041308|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041309|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041310|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041311|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041312|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041313|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041314|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041315|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041316|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041317|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041318|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041319|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041320|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041321|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_025.wav|||Something has to be done.|
041322|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_026.wav|||That is where the damage has been done.|
041323|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_027.wav|||He may not need to force that message.|
041324|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_028.wav|||These decisions are not simple.|
041325|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_029.wav|||The results were very clear.|
041326|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_030.wav|||We must convince the citizens.|
041327|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_031.wav|||I decided it is going to be William.|
041328|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_032.wav|||But we need to keep it there.|
041329|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_033.wav|||It is a case of taking a risk.|
041330|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_034.wav|||I am really ready for it now.|
041331|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_035.wav|||He was jailed for four years.|
041332|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_036.wav|||We felt it was sufficient.|
041333|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_037.wav|||This decision is folly.|
041334|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_038.wav|||And this was well known?|
041335|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_039.wav|||It took two minutes to respond.|
041336|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_040.wav|||Why you did it will never be known.|
041337|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_041.wav|||He was in his element.|
041338|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_042.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
041339|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_043.wav|||So, we have to go back.|
041340|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_044.wav|||I'm sure he does.|
041341|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_045.wav|||He was found again almost a year later.|
041342|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_046.wav|||The answer was wrong.|
041343|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_047.wav|||They need to be helped.|
041344|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_048.wav|||It is all starting to come together.|
041345|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_049.wav|||I am the fastest player on the course.|
041346|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_050.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
041347|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_051.wav|||They were taken to prove a point.|
041348|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_052.wav|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
041349|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_053.wav|||It is an important step forward.|
041350|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_054.wav|||A final agreement has not yet been completed.|
041351|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_055.wav|||And they removed a Borderer.|
041352|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_056.wav|||That is the way it is.|
041353|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_057.wav|||That was something else.|
041354|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_058.wav|||This resulted in the following.|
041355|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_059.wav|||I want to deal with this stuff.|
041356|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_060.wav|||We will be patient but we will win.|
041357|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_061.wav|||As good as they come.|
041358|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_062.wav|||It is not for me to say.|
041359|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_063.wav|||For that much we must be grateful.|
041360|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_064.wav|||But the law is very clear on this.|
041361|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_065.wav|||I thought it was quite a positive result.|
041362|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_066.wav|||But we are very near.|
041363|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_067.wav|||Nobody else is at risk.|
041364|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_068.wav|||We are not going to back off.|
041365|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_069.wav|||He said it was for sale.|
041366|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_070.wav|||We have a strong team at the moment.|
041367|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_071.wav|||This is a dream come true.|
041368|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_072.wav|||The problem is not confined to the UK.|
041369|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_073.wav|||It is on the news.|
041370|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_074.wav|||They said there was nothing.|
041371|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_075.wav|||They were looking for things.|
041372|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_076.wav|||I've got to be better than that   Quite.|
041373|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_077.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
041374|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_078.wav|||As it should be.|
041375|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_079.wav|||We have never been short of volunteers.|
041376|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_080.wav|||But who is it?|
041377|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_081.wav|||Kenny Miller might come through.|
041378|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_082.wav|||Workers will now be balloted on the offer.|
041379|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_083.wav|||It just isn't there.|
041380|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_084.wav|||Drama is not one of them.|
041381|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_085.wav|||And we have a singer.|
041382|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_086.wav|||It was exactly four months away.|
041383|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_087.wav|||This is a personal decision for me.|
041384|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_088.wav|||It's just a failing service.|
041385|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_089.wav|||We all want to be left alone.|
041386|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_090.wav|||I was saying, No.|
041387|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_091.wav|||Where are they?|
041388|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_092.wav|||I am delighted to hear this news.|
041389|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_093.wav|||I knew him a little.|
041390|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_094.wav|||They just have a go.|
041391|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_095.wav|||If it's going in, it goes in.|
041392|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_096.wav|||Nobody called me to explain.|
041393|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_097.wav|||You didn't get a modified.|
041394|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_098.wav|||What kind of person is he?|
041395|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_099.wav|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
041396|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_100.wav|||What has changed since then?|
041397|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_101.wav|||He knows he is good.|
041398|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_102.wav|||I welcome the decision.|
041399|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_103.wav|||It could take some time.|
041400|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_104.wav|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
041401|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_105.wav|||It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|
041402|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_106.wav|||I've done a lot in that building.|
041403|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_107.wav|||Music is all consuming.|
041404|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_108.wav|||The results are very positive.|
041405|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_109.wav|||Talk of a crisis is absurd.|
041406|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_110.wav|||Which is where we come in.|
041407|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_111.wav|||I'm not looking forward to it.|
041408|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_112.wav|||Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.|
041409|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_113.wav|||He is a pro.|
041410|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_114.wav|||They have to tell it as it is.|
041411|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_115.wav|||This could easily have been another tragedy.|
041412|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_116.wav|||You should enjoy the day.|
041413|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_117.wav|||He was taken ill in his office.|
041414|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_118.wav|||We couldn't get enough of it.|
041415|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_119.wav|||Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|
041416|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_120.wav|||I am not very pleased.|
041417|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_121.wav|||It is just a statement of fact.|
041418|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_122.wav|||It was on my mind a little bit.|
041419|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_123.wav|||I will just have to be patient.|
041420|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_124.wav|||I didn't think about it again.|
041421|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_125.wav|||And if they fail?|
041422|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
041423|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_127.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
041424|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_128.wav|||We've always had something to do.|
041425|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_129.wav|||How do you take them away?|
041426|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_130.wav|||It will be released in October.|
041427|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_132.wav|||That got me out.|
041428|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_133.wav|||IT is called a killing in the trade.|
041429|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_134.wav|||It's a matter for the Committee.|
041430|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_135.wav|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
041431|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_136.wav|||I've never seen anything like it.|
041432|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_137.wav|||It was highly successful.|
041433|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_138.wav|||We needed someone and we now have him.|
041434|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_139.wav|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
041435|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_140.wav|||Only one was from Glasgow.|
041436|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_141.wav|||I'm sure he will be aware of it.|
041437|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_142.wav|||Until you hit the big games.|
041438|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_143.wav|||They received no money under the merger.|
041439|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_144.wav|||It was a big departure.|
041440|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_145.wav|||She has never mentioned it.|
041441|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_146.wav|||I want my mum.|
041442|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_147.wav|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
041443|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_148.wav|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
041444|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_149.wav|||There are no second chances.|
041445|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_150.wav|||And it was great for me.|
041446|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_151.wav|||I am extremely sad.|
041447|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_152.wav|||This series is for real.|
041448|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_153.wav|||It has still to be recovered.|
041449|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_154.wav|||The conclusion is the same.|
041450|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_155.wav|||I wish they would commit to us.|
041451|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_156.wav|||The driver just insulted me.|
041452|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_157.wav|||Something has to be put in place.|
041453|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_158.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
041454|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_159.wav|||It's a mixture of everything.|
041455|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_160.wav|||That is the sensible outcome.|
041456|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_161.wav|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
041457|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_162.wav|||This means a lot of hard decisions.|
041458|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_163.wav|||That comes at a cost.|
041459|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_164.wav|||And so did the rest of her team.|
041460|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_165.wav|||He tells the truth and that's important.|
041461|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_166.wav|||Those are difficult decisions.|
041462|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_167.wav|||The omens are not good.|
041463|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_168.wav|||The game was there to be won.|
041464|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_169.wav|||Then there's the casting.|
041465|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_170.wav|||There is no signature.|
041466|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_171.wav|||We can't go on like this.|
041467|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_172.wav|||It is a very demanding course.|
041468|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_173.wav|||Can he do it?|
041469|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_174.wav|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
041470|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_175.wav|||I've won the British.|
041471|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_176.wav|||If they wish to go, they can go.|
041472|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_177.wav|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
041473|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_178.wav|||I was just aghast.|
041474|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_179.wav|||They get money for it now.|
041475|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_180.wav|||I could have been offended.|
041476|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_181.wav|||That's not the way to think.|
041477|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_182.wav|||I can see it now.|
041478|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_183.wav|||Then everyone must consider their future.|
041479|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_184.wav|||There was nothing she could do.|
041480|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_185.wav|||We want to be part of it.|
041481|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_186.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
041482|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_187.wav|||It's not long enough.|
041483|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_188.wav|||This is positive and welcome.|
041484|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_189.wav|||Now he is back on top again.|
041485|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_190.wav|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
041486|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_191.wav|||Anything less will not do.|
041487|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_192.wav|||Failure is not an option.|
041488|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_193.wav|||That is clearly not happening fast enough.|
041489|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_194.wav|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
041490|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_195.wav|||You look at that.|
041491|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_196.wav|||They will be very physical.|
041492|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_197.wav|||It has been well worth it.|
041493|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_198.wav|||It was just a feeling.|
041494|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_199.wav|||People are trying to run away.|
041495|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_200.wav|||On the face of it, this is excellent news.|
041496|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_201.wav|||This is clearly not abuse.|
041497|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_202.wav|||He should be careful.|
041498|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_203.wav|||Everyone knew the family.|
041499|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_204.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
041500|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_205.wav|||Translation - we got it wrong.|
041501|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_206.wav|||We will be working on that this week, all right.|
041502|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_207.wav|||These are serious matters.|
041503|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_208.wav|||The pace is telling.|
041504|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_209.wav|||She has always been very friendly.|
041505|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_210.wav|||Their loss is heartbreaking.|
041506|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_211.wav|||It is his script.|
041507|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_212.wav|||I am a socialist.|
041508|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_213.wav|||The response was really good.|
041509|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_214.wav|||The squad is too small.|
041510|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_215.wav|||You can blame the defence.|
041511|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_216.wav|||Usually the enjoyment is two ways.|
041512|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_217.wav|||It just could be a good night.|
041513|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_218.wav|||But we were wrong.|
041514|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_219.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
041515|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_220.wav|||It is an outrage.|
041516|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_221.wav|||It is a performance.|
041517|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_222.wav|||It is the best place.|
041518|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_223.wav|||We tried to get them down.|
041519|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_224.wav|||There were other problems for Brown yesterday.|
041520|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_225.wav|||I don't know the full story.|
041521|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_226.wav|||Part-time staff are being laid off.|
041522|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_227.wav|||Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|
041523|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_228.wav|||But they have taken the lesson to heart.|
041524|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_229.wav|||I just want him to win a tournament.|
041525|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_230.wav|||Eight others are also believed to have died.|
041526|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_231.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
041527|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_232.wav|||I will never see my son again.|
041528|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_233.wav|||But it is being pursued.|
041529|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_234.wav|||He knew they were there.|
041530|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_235.wav|||That would end it for us.|
041531|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_236.wav|||We didn't and it cost us the game.|
041532|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_237.wav|||It attracted no complaints.|
041533|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_238.wav|||Neil is never going to come back.|
041534|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_239.wav|||The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|
041535|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_240.wav|||Four of the victims were women.|
041536|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_241.wav|||He was also very happy to listen.|
041537|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_242.wav|||It's to do with this place.|
041538|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_243.wav|||It's a technical demand.|
041539|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_244.wav|||Sadly it is a mess.|
041540|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_245.wav|||That has to take its toll.|
041541|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_246.wav|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
041542|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_247.wav|||But those days are dead and gone.|
041543|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_248.wav|||However we must not be complacent.|
041544|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_249.wav|||And that was just the start.|
041545|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_250.wav|||Nothing was meant by it.|
041546|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_251.wav|||That was my last game.|
041547|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_252.wav|||Colour is another problem.|
041548|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_253.wav|||It is not just the agencies.|
041549|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_254.wav|||It came in bits and pieces.|
041550|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_255.wav|||You don't see that.|
041551|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_256.wav|||They seem to be, anyway.|
041552|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_257.wav|||I thought they were just excited.|
041553|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_258.wav|||He will appear in court today.|
041554|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_259.wav|||Or is he?|
041555|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_260.wav|||Was he confident about his prospects?|
041556|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_261.wav|||What can you do?|
041557|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_262.wav|||It's been very difficult.|
041558|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_263.wav|||Do something that we need.|
041559|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_264.wav|||There is no other offer on the table.|
041560|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_265.wav|||When she returned, it was a wreck.|
041561|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_266.wav|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
041562|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_267.wav|||It is difficult to say.|
041563|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_268.wav|||He is not the only one.|
041564|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_269.wav|||We call it marriage.|
041565|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_270.wav|||Full back was a bit of the unknown.|
041566|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_271.wav|||It's not the tour.|
041567|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_272.wav|||So what is the secret of the success?|
041568|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_273.wav|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
041569|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_274.wav|||So was the first half.|
041570|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_275.wav|||It is still under discussion with the board.|
041571|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_276.wav|||That is one point of view.|
041572|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_277.wav|||We are in this for the long haul.|
041573|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_278.wav|||Here we go then.|
041574|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_279.wav|||No reason was given.|
041575|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_280.wav|||I can't wait for it to come out.|
041576|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_281.wav|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
041577|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_282.wav|||Indeed, that has already begun.|
041578|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_283.wav|||But it's the truth.|
041579|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_284.wav|||We have been here before.|
041580|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_285.wav|||And he did that.|
041581|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_286.wav|||And she is very clear on this.|
041582|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_287.wav|||His remarks were disgraceful.|
041583|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_288.wav|||I did not think it was very proper.|
041584|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_289.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
041585|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_290.wav|||In a way he was.|
041586|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_291.wav|||I will never forget that.|
041587|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_292.wav|||It was considered to be topical.|
041588|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_293.wav|||Well, that's all right then.|
041589|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_294.wav|||No-one is a winner in this.|
041590|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_295.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
041591|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_296.wav|||What do you think?|
041592|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_297.wav|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
041593|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_298.wav|||If we don't do it, someone else will.|
041594|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_299.wav|||Again, there was no detail.|
041595|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_300.wav|||Let the voters decide.|
041596|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_301.wav|||Then it will come.|
041597|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_302.wav|||It should be easy.|
041598|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
041599|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_304.wav|||I will build a house on the site.|
041600|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_305.wav|||We are right at the heart of Europe.|
041601|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_306.wav|||I do my job.|
041602|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_307.wav|||They have to get that sorted.|
041603|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_308.wav|||That is a dangerous assumption.|
041604|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_309.wav|||Does it make a profit?|
041605|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_310.wav|||I think it's a good sign.|
041606|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_311.wav|||A winter of discontent awaits.|
041607|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_312.wav|||I knew him well.|
041608|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_313.wav|||I am not ready to walk away.|
041609|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_314.wav|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
041610|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_315.wav|||They are already there.|
041611|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_316.wav|||I'd never given up on myself.|
041612|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_317.wav|||The concerns were unfounded.|
041613|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_318.wav|||It doesn't look good for her.|
041614|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_319.wav|||It was a management problem in the hospital.|
041615|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_320.wav|||I have some comments.|
041616|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_321.wav|||You have to be realistic.|
041617|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_322.wav|||There was nowhere for him to go.|
041618|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_323.wav|||Not that he was complaining.|
041619|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_324.wav|||We are very proud of him.|
041620|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_325.wav|||There they were, making excuses for him.|
041621|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_326.wav|||It just got out of control.|
041622|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_327.wav|||Every case is completely different.|
041623|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_328.wav|||It's all about unfinished business.|
041624|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_329.wav|||Our own people are coming over on Friday.|
041625|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_330.wav|||In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|
041626|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_331.wav|||It will be fine.|
041627|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_332.wav|||Yet the job is far from over.|
041628|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_333.wav|||He has a point.|
041629|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_334.wav|||He should emerge as the winner.|
041630|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_335.wav|||It is our other home.|
041631|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_336.wav|||When you think you cannot go on, you can.|
041632|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_337.wav|||What a difference a game can make.|
041633|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_338.wav|||It is their day.|
041634|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_339.wav|||They are a very good side, without a doubt.|
041635|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_340.wav|||They are used to it.|
041636|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_341.wav|||And we are doing it.|
041637|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_342.wav|||It's just not good enough.|
041638|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_343.wav|||I have a cold.|
041639|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_344.wav|||You've got to hand it to them.|
041640|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_345.wav|||Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.|
041641|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_346.wav|||It was his own decision.|
041642|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_347.wav|||This is still happening in the US.|
041643|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_348.wav|||And that was the real problem.|
041644|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_349.wav|||But then the problems began.|
041645|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_350.wav|||It wasn't about her singing, though.|
041646|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_351.wav|||From the opening Could It Be Magic?|
041647|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_352.wav|||The duties are still to be drawn up.|
041648|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_353.wav|||That there would be discussions.|
041649|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_354.wav|||It must not happen.|
041650|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_355.wav|||That would be unsafe.|
041651|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_356.wav|||I did not go looking anywhere else.|
041652|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_357.wav|||We had no idea what was going on.|
041653|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_358.wav|||If only it had been.|
041654|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_359.wav|||So far, it is no more.|
041655|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_360.wav|||Seven people were critically injured.|
041656|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_361.wav|||I am very sorry to be here.|
041657|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_362.wav|||He could have given them a lot.|
041658|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_363.wav|||It was up to him.|
041659|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_364.wav|||It's going to happen.|
041660|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_365.wav|||I don't think so.|
041661|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_366.wav|||And that was just about that.|
041662|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_367.wav|||By hard work, is the answer.|
041663|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_368.wav|||It is really special to me.|
041664|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_369.wav|||This is a major step forward.|
041665|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_370.wav|||They haven't got the uniform.|
041666|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_371.wav|||Well, you don't have time.|
041667|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_372.wav|||It is very funny.|
041668|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_373.wav|||I just hope it's not tonight against us.|
041669|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_374.wav|||This is good news for the industry.|
041670|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_375.wav|||There are no quick fixes.|
041671|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_376.wav|||Because they didn't want to know.|
041672|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_377.wav|||What do we have to do?|
041673|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_378.wav|||I have never seen anything like it.|
041674|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_379.wav|||It's about New Yorkers.|
041675|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_380.wav|||That was a real challenge.|
041676|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_381.wav|||They will give it a couple of years.|
041677|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_382.wav|||He certainly would have approved.|
041678|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_383.wav|||Conditions were less than ideal.|
041679|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_384.wav|||We want this place to work.|
041680|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_385.wav|||Father is on the train.|
041681|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_386.wav|||It could have been prevented.|
041682|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_387.wav|||We have been going for three years.|
041683|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_388.wav|||Firstly, we don't know we can do this.|
041684|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_389.wav|||I think it was entirely the right decision.|
041685|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_390.wav|||It is planned for London in the spring.|
041686|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_391.wav|||Everything is coming together well.|
041687|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_392.wav|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
041688|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_393.wav|||But we are not afraid of them.|
041689|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_394.wav|||It didn't matter who was in their way.|
041690|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_395.wav|||That will be the criteria for the future.|
041691|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_396.wav|||They thought they couldn't get any.|
041692|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_397.wav|||He was too good for me - too consistent.|
041693|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_398.wav|||I am delighted to have her back home.|
041694|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_399.wav|||This idea is a good starting point.|
041695|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_400.wav|||She had denied the charge.|
041696|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_401.wav|||It was cynical and callous.|
041697|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_402.wav|||It's a dead end.|
041698|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_403.wav|||What sort of man is that?|
041699|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_404.wav|||The message was clear.|
041700|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_405.wav|||We are going nowhere.|
041701|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_406.wav|||It is truly masterly performance.|
041702|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_407.wav|||She failed to win any of them.|
041703|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_408.wav|||It is believed he had been stabbed.|
041704|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_409.wav|||Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|
041705|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_410.wav|||It has a rally instead of a conference.|
041706|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_411.wav|||I found that we couldn't.|
041707|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_412.wav|||He is very sensitive.|
041708|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_413.wav|||That can benefit the larger companies.|
041709|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_414.wav|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
041710|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_415.wav|||We told them in July.|
041711|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_416.wav|||This was a very tragic accident.|
041712|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_417.wav|||We are very, very confident.|
041713|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_418.wav|||It is a result we should savour.|
041714|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_419.wav|||Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|
041715|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_420.wav|||We certainly do not intend to disband.|
041716|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_421.wav|||My life is going to go on.|
041717|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_422.wav|||It's really part of our mission.|
041718|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_423.wav|||That was only the start.|
041719|361-en-f|en|wav/p361_424.wav|||But what took them so long?|
041720|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
041721|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
041722|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041723|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041724|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041725|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041726|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041727|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041728|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041729|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041730|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041731|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041732|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041733|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041734|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041735|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041736|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041737|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041738|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|

041742|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041743|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

041932|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_214.wav|||It is a worry.|
041933|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_215.wav|||We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|
041934|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_216.wav|||That is highly unfair.|
041935|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_217.wav|||They are not the answer to staff shortages.|
041936|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_218.wav|||Gas is too expensive.|
041937|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_219.wav|||This plan is an agenda for action.|
041938|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_220.wav|||It was all relative.|
041939|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_221.wav|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
041940|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_222.wav|||Are you up for business?|
041941|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_223.wav|||It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|
041942|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_224.wav|||You are not in any kind of trouble.|
041943|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_225.wav|||It also makes for interesting viewing.|
041944|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_226.wav|||Life becomes a song.|
041945|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_227.wav|||No wonder he missed the conversion.|
041946|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_228.wav|||Sadly, they did not.|
041947|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_229.wav|||We have nowhere to go.|
041948|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_230.wav|||He has every right to do that.|
041949|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_231.wav|||Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|
041950|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_232.wav|||That had never happened.|
041951|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_233.wav|||However, our players will fight for that.|
041952|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_234.wav|||They are not suitable.|
041953|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_235.wav|||He is advised that he has done so.|
041954|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_236.wav|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
041955|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_237.wav|||He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|
041956|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_238.wav|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
041957|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_239.wav|||But the killing will continue.|
041958|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_240.wav|||They've got to get better.|
041959|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_241.wav|||But we are working together for this result.|
041960|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_242.wav|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
041961|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_243.wav|||It doesn't make them evil.|
041962|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_244.wav|||We don't want to be too intrusive.|
041963|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_245.wav|||The most important thing is the game.|
041964|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_246.wav|||He said nothing of the sort.|
041965|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_247.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
041966|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_248.wav|||In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|
041967|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_249.wav|||The door is open.|
041968|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_250.wav|||Pulled a huge number of viewers.|
041969|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_251.wav|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
041970|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_252.wav|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
041971|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_253.wav|||So what went wrong?|
041972|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_254.wav|||We did not play well.|
041973|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_255.wav|||We are in a very strong position.|
041974|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_256.wav|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
041975|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_257.wav|||That is the key.|
041976|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_258.wav|||So, how did you do?|
041977|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_259.wav|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
041978|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_260.wav|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
041979|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_261.wav|||I can't deny that fact.|
041980|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_262.wav|||She is now planning a visit.|
041981|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_263.wav|||We could have done without this.|
041982|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_264.wav|||Boy is the town a mess.|
041983|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_265.wav|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
041984|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_266.wav|||He's a great dealer.|
041985|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_267.wav|||Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|
041986|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_268.wav|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
041987|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_269.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
041988|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_270.wav|||We are moving on.|
041989|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_271.wav|||This is not a crisis.|
041990|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_272.wav|||There's always a chance.|
041991|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_273.wav|||I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|
041992|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_274.wav|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
041993|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_275.wav|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
041994|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_276.wav|||That's a very serious matter.|
041995|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_277.wav|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
041996|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_278.wav|||But it was to no avail.|
041997|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_279.wav|||Sad to say, it's still waiting.|
041998|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_280.wav|||It has been a major success.|
041999|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_281.wav|||It takes a bit of working out.|
042000|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_282.wav|||I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|
042001|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_283.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
042002|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_284.wav|||I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|
042003|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_285.wav|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
042004|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_286.wav|||He will not be coming back.|
042005|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_287.wav|||He is also a great finisher.|
042006|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_288.wav|||I don't see any problem.|
042007|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_289.wav|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
042008|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_290.wav|||Yet it seemed to work.|
042009|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_291.wav|||Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|
042010|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_292.wav|||I have never felt so well.|
042011|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_293.wav|||There are other things going on.|
042012|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_294.wav|||All is now forgiven.|
042013|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_295.wav|||So who is right?|
042014|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_296.wav|||And this tournament will travel.|
042015|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_297.wav|||There will be new memories.|
042016|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_298.wav|||Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|
042017|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_299.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
042018|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_300.wav|||How can they get one?|
042019|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_301.wav|||It was an insult.|
042020|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_302.wav|||But we all have to look at ourselves.|
042021|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_303.wav|||We have nothing to hide.|
042022|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_304.wav|||He added, We are full of anger.|
042023|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_305.wav|||He did it all for us.|
042024|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_306.wav|||I don't think that is good enough.|
042025|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_307.wav|||Of course it is.|
042026|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_308.wav|||We all make mistakes.|
042027|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_309.wav|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
042028|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_310.wav|||That is my commitment.|
042029|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_311.wav|||This is the only problem with the story.|
042030|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_312.wav|||It is good football in Scotland.|
042031|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_313.wav|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
042032|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_314.wav|||Is that right?|
042033|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_315.wav|||So other options had to be explored.|
042034|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_316.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
042035|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_317.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
042036|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_318.wav|||It is good news for us.|
042037|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_319.wav|||The timing is obvious.|
042038|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_320.wav|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
042039|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_321.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
042040|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_322.wav|||I don't think it's very real.|
042041|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_323.wav|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
042042|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_324.wav|||I think she was right.|
042043|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_325.wav|||Is that what people want?|
042044|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_326.wav|||CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|
042045|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_327.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
042046|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_328.wav|||It will be a new experience.|
042047|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_329.wav|||The process itself has taken over.|
042048|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_330.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
042049|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_331.wav|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
042050|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_332.wav|||It is quite hard to track.|
042051|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_333.wav|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042052|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_334.wav|||But his attendance is not guaranteed.|
042053|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_335.wav|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
042054|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_336.wav|||I am sure all schools would accept that.|
042055|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_337.wav|||It was quite an ordeal for them.|
042056|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_338.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
042057|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_339.wav|||Doesn't matter what you do.|
042058|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_340.wav|||O no it's not!|
042059|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_341.wav|||The result could be all down to turnout.|
042060|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_342.wav|||They are in good spirits.|
042061|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_343.wav|||Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|
042062|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_344.wav|||He was their leader.|
042063|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_345.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
042064|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_346.wav|||So far he has not done so.|
042065|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_347.wav|||Maybe they will show it next year.|
042066|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_348.wav|||They are a very good team.|
042067|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_349.wav|||So there we are.|
042068|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_350.wav|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
042069|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_351.wav|||It doesn't make me feel any better.|
042070|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_352.wav|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
042071|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_353.wav|||The incident is dead.|
042072|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_354.wav|||We are delighted with the result.|
042073|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_355.wav|||It will take time.|
042074|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_356.wav|||They will do something big.|
042075|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_357.wav|||The programme was awful.|
042076|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_358.wav|||It is having a big impact.|
042077|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_359.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
042078|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_360.wav|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042079|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_361.wav|||Doesn't he miss it?|
042080|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_362.wav|||The same goes for Russia.|
042081|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_363.wav|||They went down together.|
042082|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_364.wav|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
042083|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_365.wav|||One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|
042084|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_366.wav|||We were getting very worried.|
042085|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_367.wav|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
042086|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_368.wav|||You can't really compare.|
042087|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_369.wav|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
042088|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_370.wav|||Plot is not the issue.|
042089|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_371.wav|||We need to increase the membership.|
042090|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_372.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
042091|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_373.wav|||We should not be complacent.|
042092|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_374.wav|||We all want the same things.|
042093|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_375.wav|||Maybe his time has gone.|
042094|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_376.wav|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
042095|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_377.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
042096|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_378.wav|||SO, that is it for another year.|
042097|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_379.wav|||The results are tragic.|
042098|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_380.wav|||We are not getting him back.|
042099|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_381.wav|||He was on a horse.|
042100|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_382.wav|||Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
042101|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_383.wav|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
042102|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_384.wav|||There may be reasons for it.|
042103|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_385.wav|||He had taken everything from me.|
042104|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_386.wav|||It's a good offer by any standards.|
042105|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_387.wav|||Yes, it took time to recover.|
042106|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_388.wav|||The potential is always in the idea.|
042107|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_389.wav|||I am not a frustrated actor.|
042108|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_390.wav|||No progress has been made.|
042109|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_391.wav|||He can win every week.|
042110|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_392.wav|||This makes up for it.|
042111|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_393.wav|||My mind was made up.|
042112|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_394.wav|||The plot is changing as time goes on.|
042113|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_395.wav|||I never got anything out of it.|
042114|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_396.wav|||It is patently true.|
042115|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_397.wav|||Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|
042116|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_398.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
042117|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_399.wav|||That is why he is so special.|
042118|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_400.wav|||You hope he prevails.|
042119|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_401.wav|||My mother was getting on at me.|
042120|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_402.wav|||This is a very serious matter.|
042121|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_403.wav|||It's going to be great!|
042122|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_404.wav|||That's a good sign.|
042123|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_405.wav|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
042124|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_406.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
042125|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_407.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
042126|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_408.wav|||He declined to be more specific.|
042127|362-en-f|en|wav/p362_409.wav|||But it looks good for next year.|
