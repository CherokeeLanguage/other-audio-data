000002|225-en|en|wav/p225_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
000003|225-en|en|wav/p225_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
000004|225-en|en|wav/p225_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
000005|225-en|en|wav/p225_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
000006|225-en|en|wav/p225_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
000007|225-en|en|wav/p225_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000008|225-en|en|wav/p225_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
000009|225-en|en|wav/p225_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
000010|225-en|en|wav/p225_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
000011|225-en|en|wav/p225_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000012|225-en|en|wav/p225_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000013|225-en|en|wav/p225_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
000014|225-en|en|wav/p225_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
000015|225-en|en|wav/p225_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000016|225-en|en|wav/p225_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
000017|225-en|en|wav/p225_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
000018|225-en|en|wav/p225_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
000019|225-en|en|wav/p225_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000020|225-en|en|wav/p225_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000021|225-en|en|wav/p225_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000022|225-en|en|wav/p225_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
000023|225-en|en|wav/p225_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
000024|225-en|en|wav/p225_025.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
000025|225-en|en|wav/p225_026.wav|||How are you, sir ?|
000026|225-en|en|wav/p225_027.wav|||So is that it, then ?|
000027|225-en|en|wav/p225_028.wav|||Do I have a favourite ?|
000028|225-en|en|wav/p225_029.wav|||What do we do ?|
000029|225-en|en|wav/p225_030.wav|||People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|
000030|225-en|en|wav/p225_033.wav|||It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|
000031|225-en|en|wav/p225_035.wav|||A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.|
000032|225-en|en|wav/p225_036.wav|||It was a close call.|
000033|225-en|en|wav/p225_037.wav|||In fact, they are the future of investment.|
000034|225-en|en|wav/p225_038.wav|||Diving is no part of football.|
000035|225-en|en|wav/p225_039.wav|||However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|
000036|225-en|en|wav/p225_040.wav|||You'd better believe it.|
000037|225-en|en|wav/p225_044.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
000038|225-en|en|wav/p225_045.wav|||People were determined to change the Government in the last election.|
000039|225-en|en|wav/p225_046.wav|||No details of the talks were given.|
000040|225-en|en|wav/p225_049.wav|||I have learned from him.|
000041|225-en|en|wav/p225_051.wav|||We are committed to the ban.|
000042|225-en|en|wav/p225_052.wav|||Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.|
000043|225-en|en|wav/p225_053.wav|||I have made that offer.|
000044|225-en|en|wav/p225_054.wav|||Four other charges were dropped.|
000045|225-en|en|wav/p225_056.wav|||Clearly, it can go either way.|
000046|225-en|en|wav/p225_057.wav|||However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|
000047|225-en|en|wav/p225_058.wav|||However, the problem is the timing.|
000048|225-en|en|wav/p225_059.wav|||But retail banking would be run from Halifax.|
000049|225-en|en|wav/p225_060.wav|||Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.|
000050|225-en|en|wav/p225_061.wav|||Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.|
000051|225-en|en|wav/p225_062.wav|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
000052|225-en|en|wav/p225_063.wav|||Both sides have been hit by injury.|
000053|225-en|en|wav/p225_064.wav|||It could take some time.|
000054|225-en|en|wav/p225_065.wav|||There is no pressure on us.|
000055|225-en|en|wav/p225_066.wav|||It is a job creation scheme.|
000056|225-en|en|wav/p225_067.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
000057|225-en|en|wav/p225_070.wav|||That is bound to happen.|
000058|225-en|en|wav/p225_071.wav|||He is in the queue.|
000059|225-en|en|wav/p225_072.wav|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
000060|225-en|en|wav/p225_073.wav|||So, did she meet him ?|
000061|225-en|en|wav/p225_081.wav|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
000062|225-en|en|wav/p225_082.wav|||That view is held by many others within the industry.|
000063|225-en|en|wav/p225_083.wav|||Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|
000064|225-en|en|wav/p225_084.wav|||He is delighted, and he has every right to be.|
000065|225-en|en|wav/p225_086.wav|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
000066|225-en|en|wav/p225_089.wav|||Officers recovered a second body in the area.|
000067|225-en|en|wav/p225_090.wav|||I did not have a bet on myself.|
000068|225-en|en|wav/p225_092.wav|||There is a contract in existence for Allan.|
000069|225-en|en|wav/p225_094.wav|||That's as it should be.|
000070|225-en|en|wav/p225_103.wav|||Everyone deserves to share in this success.|
000071|225-en|en|wav/p225_104.wav|||His is a success story by any standard.|
000072|225-en|en|wav/p225_108.wav|||Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|
000073|225-en|en|wav/p225_109.wav|||That might help a bit.|
000074|225-en|en|wav/p225_110.wav|||Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|
000075|225-en|en|wav/p225_111.wav|||It isn't a happy memory.|
000076|225-en|en|wav/p225_113.wav|||The big issue for us is the review.|
000077|225-en|en|wav/p225_114.wav|||I told him I was a long time ago.|
000078|225-en|en|wav/p225_115.wav|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
000079|225-en|en|wav/p225_116.wav|||Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.|
000080|225-en|en|wav/p225_117.wav|||We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.|
000081|225-en|en|wav/p225_118.wav|||We suffered a lot for seven years.|
000082|225-en|en|wav/p225_120.wav|||The industry is not well organised.|
000083|225-en|en|wav/p225_121.wav|||You get a lot for your money.|
000084|225-en|en|wav/p225_122.wav|||I didn't feel under any pressure.|
000085|225-en|en|wav/p225_123.wav|||It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|
000086|225-en|en|wav/p225_124.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
000087|225-en|en|wav/p225_126.wav|||The squad is too small.|
000088|225-en|en|wav/p225_127.wav|||It is a common problem.|
000089|225-en|en|wav/p225_128.wav|||Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.|
000090|225-en|en|wav/p225_131.wav|||Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.|
000091|225-en|en|wav/p225_133.wav|||I think he's the favourite.|
000092|225-en|en|wav/p225_135.wav|||We have seen a copy of the report.|
000093|225-en|en|wav/p225_136.wav|||But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.|
000094|225-en|en|wav/p225_141.wav|||Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.|
000095|225-en|en|wav/p225_142.wav|||Well, you can have a tree.|
000096|225-en|en|wav/p225_143.wav|||Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.|
000097|225-en|en|wav/p225_144.wav|||She will do for me.|
000098|225-en|en|wav/p225_145.wav|||Why change it ?|
000099|225-en|en|wav/p225_147.wav|||Does the name matter ?|
000100|225-en|en|wav/p225_149.wav|||Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.|
000101|225-en|en|wav/p225_150.wav|||But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.|

000109|225-en|en|wav/p225_165.wav|||The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|
000110|225-en|en|wav/p225_166.wav|||Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.|
000111|225-en|en|wav/p225_169.wav|||Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.|
000112|225-en|en|wav/p225_171.wav|||The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.|
000113|225-en|en|wav/p225_172.wav|||Nobody did in those days.|
000114|225-en|en|wav/p225_173.wav|||But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.|
000115|225-en|en|wav/p225_174.wav|||He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.|
000116|225-en|en|wav/p225_175.wav|||At that point, the structure of the board was changed.|
000117|225-en|en|wav/p225_176.wav|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|
000118|225-en|en|wav/p225_177.wav|||The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|
000119|225-en|en|wav/p225_179.wav|||They know no other way.|
000120|225-en|en|wav/p225_182.wav|||We are just glad to be alive.|
000121|225-en|en|wav/p225_191.wav|||People will ask about us.|
000122|225-en|en|wav/p225_192.wav|||However, this idea is never developed.|
000123|225-en|en|wav/p225_193.wav|||It's very difficult to find a buyer.|
000124|225-en|en|wav/p225_195.wav|||It is hard to tell.|
000125|225-en|en|wav/p225_196.wav|||I think, therefore I am ?|
000126|225-en|en|wav/p225_197.wav|||Who was she ?|
000127|225-en|en|wav/p225_199.wav|||And they were being paid ?|
000128|225-en|en|wav/p225_200.wav|||It looked like a river.|
000129|225-en|en|wav/p225_201.wav|||The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.|
000130|225-en|en|wav/p225_202.wav|||The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.|
000131|225-en|en|wav/p225_203.wav|||They have the cash and the fire power.|
000132|225-en|en|wav/p225_208.wav|||You are a great player.|
000133|225-en|en|wav/p225_210.wav|||Scotland will play its part.|
000134|225-en|en|wav/p225_211.wav|||He added that he was very sad about O Neill.|
000135|225-en|en|wav/p225_212.wav|||After that nothing could save him.|

000143|225-en|en|wav/p225_225.wav|||It is good for our team.|
000144|225-en|en|wav/p225_235.wav|||I always felt that I was in control of the match.|
000145|225-en|en|wav/p225_236.wav|||That will be the criteria for the future.|
000146|225-en|en|wav/p225_237.wav|||Frankly, we were lucky to get second.|
000147|225-en|en|wav/p225_238.wav|||Paterson can afford to be generous.|
000148|225-en|en|wav/p225_239.wav|||In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.|

000154|225-en|en|wav/p225_248.wav|||Does that put pressure on us ?|
000155|225-en|en|wav/p225_253.wav|||Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.|
000156|225-en|en|wav/p225_254.wav|||The problem was a social problem.|
000157|225-en|en|wav/p225_257.wav|||My son was too young to die.|
000158|225-en|en|wav/p225_258.wav|||We were not allowed to go to help them.|
000159|225-en|en|wav/p225_264.wav|||That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|

000167|225-en|en|wav/p225_277.wav|||It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|
000168|225-en|en|wav/p225_279.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
000169|225-en|en|wav/p225_280.wav|||Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|

000196|225-en|en|wav/p225_316.wav|||It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.|

000238|226-en|en|wav/p226_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000239|226-en|en|wav/p226_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

000241|226-en|en|wav/p226_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|

000921|227-en|en|wav/p227_344.wav|||Public opinion was split on the proposal.|

000927|227-en|en|wav/p227_351.wav|||There will have to be a full inquiry.|
000928|227-en|en|wav/p227_352.wav|||There was no time scale.|

000946|227-en|en|wav/p227_371.wav|||Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.|
000947|227-en|en|wav/p227_372.wav|||His views are hardly surprising.|
000948|227-en|en|wav/p227_373.wav|||The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.|
000949|227-en|en|wav/p227_374.wav|||It has been made to entertain.|
000950|227-en|en|wav/p227_375.wav|||It is a stroke of genius.|
000951|227-en|en|wav/p227_376.wav|||Italy was just behind the US.|
000952|227-en|en|wav/p227_377.wav|||It was forced to divert.|

000967|227-en|en|wav/p227_393.wav|||You have to rely on each other.|
000968|227-en|en|wav/p227_394.wav|||I wanted to go out on a high.|

000970|227-en|en|wav/p227_396.wav|||It is a terrible equation.|
000971|227-en|en|wav/p227_397.wav|||They have not got anyone.|
000972|227-en|en|wav/p227_398.wav|||I can hardly believe it.|

000974|227-en|en|wav/p227_400.wav|||However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|
000975|227-en|en|wav/p227_401.wav|||After the match, do you ?|

000980|228-en|en|wav/p228_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
000981|228-en|en|wav/p228_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
000982|228-en|en|wav/p228_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
000983|228-en|en|wav/p228_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000984|228-en|en|wav/p228_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
000985|228-en|en|wav/p228_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
000986|228-en|en|wav/p228_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
000987|228-en|en|wav/p228_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000988|228-en|en|wav/p228_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000989|228-en|en|wav/p228_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
000990|228-en|en|wav/p228_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
000991|228-en|en|wav/p228_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
000992|228-en|en|wav/p228_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000993|228-en|en|wav/p228_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
000994|228-en|en|wav/p228_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
000995|228-en|en|wav/p228_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000996|228-en|en|wav/p228_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000997|228-en|en|wav/p228_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000999|228-en|en|wav/p228_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
001000|228-en|en|wav/p228_025.wav|||It's nice to hear.|
001001|228-en|en|wav/p228_026.wav|||So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|
001002|228-en|en|wav/p228_027.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
001003|228-en|en|wav/p228_028.wav|||There's a story, too.|

001315|228-en|en|wav/p228_344.wav|||The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|
001316|228-en|en|wav/p228_345.wav|||He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|
001317|228-en|en|wav/p228_346.wav|||That is a break with tradition.|

001334|228-en|en|wav/p228_363.wav|||I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|
001335|228-en|en|wav/p228_364.wav|||It is a simple equation.|
001336|228-en|en|wav/p228_365.wav|||So there, we won.|
001337|228-en|en|wav/p228_366.wav|||But I managed.|
001338|228-en|en|wav/p228_367.wav|||By that time, however, it was already too late.|

001347|229-en|en|wav/p229_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
001348|229-en|en|wav/p229_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
001349|229-en|en|wav/p229_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
001350|229-en|en|wav/p229_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
001351|229-en|en|wav/p229_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
001352|229-en|en|wav/p229_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
001353|229-en|en|wav/p229_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
001354|229-en|en|wav/p229_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
001355|229-en|en|wav/p229_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
001356|229-en|en|wav/p229_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
001357|229-en|en|wav/p229_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
001358|229-en|en|wav/p229_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
001359|229-en|en|wav/p229_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
001360|229-en|en|wav/p229_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
001361|229-en|en|wav/p229_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
001362|229-en|en|wav/p229_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
001363|229-en|en|wav/p229_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
001364|229-en|en|wav/p229_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
001365|229-en|en|wav/p229_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
001366|229-en|en|wav/p229_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
001367|229-en|en|wav/p229_025.wav|||Johnson was pretty low.|
001368|229-en|en|wav/p229_026.wav|||He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|
001369|229-en|en|wav/p229_027.wav|||It's nice to hear.|
001370|229-en|en|wav/p229_028.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|
001371|229-en|en|wav/p229_029.wav|||I have a theory.|
001372|229-en|en|wav/p229_030.wav|||It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.|
001373|229-en|en|wav/p229_031.wav|||So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|
001374|229-en|en|wav/p229_032.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
001375|229-en|en|wav/p229_033.wav|||And we have a singer.|
001376|229-en|en|wav/p229_034.wav|||A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.|
001377|229-en|en|wav/p229_035.wav|||It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|

001379|229-en|en|wav/p229_037.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
001380|229-en|en|wav/p229_038.wav|||In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.|
001381|229-en|en|wav/p229_039.wav|||They're just different.|
001382|229-en|en|wav/p229_040.wav|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
001383|229-en|en|wav/p229_041.wav|||It is not for any other purpose.|
001384|229-en|en|wav/p229_042.wav|||He did not know his daughter.|
001385|229-en|en|wav/p229_043.wav|||People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|
001386|229-en|en|wav/p229_044.wav|||I was scared.|
001387|229-en|en|wav/p229_045.wav|||It will come all right.|
001388|229-en|en|wav/p229_046.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
001389|229-en|en|wav/p229_047.wav|||But it is all by design.|
001390|229-en|en|wav/p229_048.wav|||I am just going to go for it.|

001631|229-en|en|wav/p229_294.wav|||It shows a contempt by him for the industry.|
001632|229-en|en|wav/p229_295.wav|||These figures are truly awful.|
001633|229-en|en|wav/p229_296.wav|||Sunday's game was not a trial.|

001649|229-en|en|wav/p229_313.wav|||Let's hope it's an investment in the future.|
001650|229-en|en|wav/p229_314.wav|||It's certainly different.|

001685|229-en|en|wav/p229_352.wav|||Everything was an effort.|
001686|229-en|en|wav/p229_353.wav|||This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.|
001687|229-en|en|wav/p229_354.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
001688|229-en|en|wav/p229_355.wav|||It is long gone.|
001689|229-en|en|wav/p229_356.wav|||It's the last thing on my mind.|
001690|229-en|en|wav/p229_357.wav|||Tell us about it.|
001691|229-en|en|wav/p229_358.wav|||There is a cup final at stake.|
001692|229-en|en|wav/p229_359.wav|||That is a break with tradition.|
001693|229-en|en|wav/p229_360.wav|||It was very formal.|
001694|229-en|en|wav/p229_361.wav|||They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|
001695|229-en|en|wav/p229_362.wav|||In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|

001697|229-en|en|wav/p229_364.wav|||It was fit for royalty.|

001703|229-en|en|wav/p229_370.wav|||He could make it.|
001704|229-en|en|wav/p229_371.wav|||He later became a respected High Court judge.|
001705|229-en|en|wav/p229_373.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
001706|229-en|en|wav/p229_374.wav|||It is not too late to get on board.|
001707|229-en|en|wav/p229_376.wav|||It is a simple equation.|
001708|229-en|en|wav/p229_377.wav|||Talks are progressing.|
001709|229-en|en|wav/p229_378.wav|||They play together perfectly.|
001710|229-en|en|wav/p229_379.wav|||It's a long process.|
001711|229-en|en|wav/p229_380.wav|||Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|
001712|229-en|en|wav/p229_381.wav|||It does not even have a staff shortage.|
001713|229-en|en|wav/p229_382.wav|||However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|
001714|229-en|en|wav/p229_384.wav|||It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.|
001715|229-en|en|wav/p229_386.wav|||Three years ago he would have been.|
001716|229-en|en|wav/p229_387.wav|||That team is due to be announced this morning.|
001717|229-en|en|wav/p229_388.wav|||It has been a lovely family occasion.|
001718|229-en|en|wav/p229_389.wav|||That's the name of the game, though.|
001719|229-en|en|wav/p229_390.wav|||There were no casualties.|
001720|229-en|en|wav/p229_391.wav|||A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|
001721|229-en|en|wav/p229_392.wav|||Yet the data is compelling.|

001723|230-en|en|wav/p230_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
001724|230-en|en|wav/p230_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
001725|230-en|en|wav/p230_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
001726|230-en|en|wav/p230_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
001727|230-en|en|wav/p230_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
001728|230-en|en|wav/p230_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
001729|230-en|en|wav/p230_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
001730|230-en|en|wav/p230_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
001731|230-en|en|wav/p230_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
001732|230-en|en|wav/p230_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
001733|230-en|en|wav/p230_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
001734|230-en|en|wav/p230_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
001735|230-en|en|wav/p230_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
001736|230-en|en|wav/p230_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
001737|230-en|en|wav/p230_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
001738|230-en|en|wav/p230_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
001739|230-en|en|wav/p230_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
001741|230-en|en|wav/p230_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
001742|230-en|en|wav/p230_025.wav|||It is on the internet.|
001743|230-en|en|wav/p230_026.wav|||Smoking is also very important.|
001744|230-en|en|wav/p230_027.wav|||He has the courage of the unaware.|
001745|230-en|en|wav/p230_028.wav|||Life was like a timetable.|
001746|230-en|en|wav/p230_029.wav|||It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
001747|230-en|en|wav/p230_030.wav|||Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|
001748|230-en|en|wav/p230_031.wav|||I'm so happy that she did.|
001749|230-en|en|wav/p230_032.wav|||The wedding was in Edinburgh.|
001750|230-en|en|wav/p230_033.wav|||Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|
001751|230-en|en|wav/p230_034.wav|||He really is a lovely man.|
001752|230-en|en|wav/p230_035.wav|||The staff are as good as any staff in the city.|
001753|230-en|en|wav/p230_036.wav|||This represents a tough game for us.|
001754|230-en|en|wav/p230_037.wav|||The boy is no longer with us.|
001755|230-en|en|wav/p230_038.wav|||They said she was stable.|
001756|230-en|en|wav/p230_039.wav|||This will save interest charges.|
001757|230-en|en|wav/p230_040.wav|||Well, he is an artist.|
001758|230-en|en|wav/p230_041.wav|||He looks like an Afghan.|
001759|230-en|en|wav/p230_042.wav|||People want to see me on the screen.|
001760|230-en|en|wav/p230_043.wav|||The big problem is the lack of grass.|
001761|230-en|en|wav/p230_044.wav|||That was the theory, anyway.|
001762|230-en|en|wav/p230_045.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
001763|230-en|en|wav/p230_046.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
001764|230-en|en|wav/p230_047.wav|||I must take a seat.|
001765|230-en|en|wav/p230_048.wav|||It was bound to happen.|
001766|230-en|en|wav/p230_049.wav|||We have to bring in new players.|
001767|230-en|en|wav/p230_050.wav|||In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|
001768|230-en|en|wav/p230_051.wav|||I have made that offer.|
001769|230-en|en|wav/p230_052.wav|||None has ever been found.|
001770|230-en|en|wav/p230_053.wav|||Four other charges were dropped.|
001771|230-en|en|wav/p230_054.wav|||We should be able to cope.|
001772|230-en|en|wav/p230_055.wav|||There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|
001773|230-en|en|wav/p230_056.wav|||We will pay their bills.|
001774|230-en|en|wav/p230_057.wav|||You should consider whether you want to be in this film.|
001775|230-en|en|wav/p230_058.wav|||It was exactly four months away.|
001776|230-en|en|wav/p230_059.wav|||He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|
001777|230-en|en|wav/p230_060.wav|||It's not covered by the insurance.|
001778|230-en|en|wav/p230_061.wav|||But the challenge is in the US.|
001779|230-en|en|wav/p230_062.wav|||Robin Williams is very subdued.|
001780|230-en|en|wav/p230_063.wav|||The tournament has now been cancelled.|
001781|230-en|en|wav/p230_064.wav|||They would now be able to look forward with confidence.|
001782|230-en|en|wav/p230_065.wav|||Both sides have been hit by injury.|
001783|230-en|en|wav/p230_066.wav|||He also received a medal of honour.|
001784|230-en|en|wav/p230_068.wav|||It may be that lifestyle is behind it.|
001785|230-en|en|wav/p230_069.wav|||It is a job creation scheme.|
001786|230-en|en|wav/p230_070.wav|||It looks like a hit.|
001787|230-en|en|wav/p230_071.wav|||What do we do ?|
001788|230-en|en|wav/p230_072.wav|||Why do it otherwise ?|
001789|230-en|en|wav/p230_073.wav|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
001790|230-en|en|wav/p230_074.wav|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
001791|230-en|en|wav/p230_075.wav|||After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.|
001792|230-en|en|wav/p230_076.wav|||Consumer confidence remains an issue.|
001793|230-en|en|wav/p230_077.wav|||Last week, he was taken into hospital.|
001794|230-en|en|wav/p230_078.wav|||This is a true story.|
001795|230-en|en|wav/p230_079.wav|||By then, he was walking on water.|
001796|230-en|en|wav/p230_080.wav|||It's so hard to shift.|
001797|230-en|en|wav/p230_081.wav|||They lived for their children.|
001798|230-en|en|wav/p230_083.wav|||It might change your life.|
001799|230-en|en|wav/p230_084.wav|||You are a great player.|
001800|230-en|en|wav/p230_085.wav|||However, it did not end that way.|
001801|230-en|en|wav/p230_086.wav|||We will deal with the refugees.|
001802|230-en|en|wav/p230_087.wav|||It was not an insult.|
001803|230-en|en|wav/p230_088.wav|||You might not make it.|
001804|230-en|en|wav/p230_089.wav|||However, a decision should be made before the end of August.|
001805|230-en|en|wav/p230_090.wav|||I did not have a bet on myself.|
001806|230-en|en|wav/p230_091.wav|||The conclusion is the same.|
001807|230-en|en|wav/p230_092.wav|||He was prepared for this.|
001808|230-en|en|wav/p230_093.wav|||But I know the course.|

002041|230-en|en|wav/p230_338.wav|||Public opinion was split on the proposal.|

002124|231-en|en|wav/p231_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
002125|231-en|en|wav/p231_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
002126|231-en|en|wav/p231_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
002127|231-en|en|wav/p231_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
002128|231-en|en|wav/p231_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
002129|231-en|en|wav/p231_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
002130|231-en|en|wav/p231_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
002131|231-en|en|wav/p231_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
002132|231-en|en|wav/p231_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
002133|231-en|en|wav/p231_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
002134|231-en|en|wav/p231_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
002135|231-en|en|wav/p231_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
002136|231-en|en|wav/p231_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
002137|231-en|en|wav/p231_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
002138|231-en|en|wav/p231_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
002139|231-en|en|wav/p231_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
002140|231-en|en|wav/p231_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
002141|231-en|en|wav/p231_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
002142|231-en|en|wav/p231_025.wav|||On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|
002143|231-en|en|wav/p231_026.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
002144|231-en|en|wav/p231_027.wav|||Because we do not need it.|

002149|231-en|en|wav/p231_032.wav|||If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|
002150|231-en|en|wav/p231_033.wav|||It carried a double message.|
002151|231-en|en|wav/p231_034.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
002152|231-en|en|wav/p231_035.wav|||I became a widow overnight.|

002161|231-en|en|wav/p231_044.wav|||He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.|
002162|231-en|en|wav/p231_045.wav|||I guess I was lucky, though.|
002163|231-en|en|wav/p231_046.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
002164|231-en|en|wav/p231_047.wav|||A win is a win.|
002165|231-en|en|wav/p231_048.wav|||There was no safety net.|
002166|231-en|en|wav/p231_049.wav|||There's nothing we could do about this.|
002167|231-en|en|wav/p231_050.wav|||It is a symbolic concert.|
002168|231-en|en|wav/p231_051.wav|||We keep an eye on it.|
002169|231-en|en|wav/p231_052.wav|||We have not given up hope.|
002170|231-en|en|wav/p231_053.wav|||The cuts were made within an hour of each other.|
002171|231-en|en|wav/p231_054.wav|||She said she was really sorry.|
002172|231-en|en|wav/p231_055.wav|||In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.|
002173|231-en|en|wav/p231_056.wav|||Italy is a beautiful place.|
002174|231-en|en|wav/p231_057.wav|||Four other charges were dropped.|
002175|231-en|en|wav/p231_058.wav|||We should be able to cope.|
002176|231-en|en|wav/p231_059.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
002177|231-en|en|wav/p231_061.wav|||So is that it, then ?|
002178|231-en|en|wav/p231_062.wav|||Do I have a favourite ?|
002179|231-en|en|wav/p231_063.wav|||What do we do ?|
002180|231-en|en|wav/p231_064.wav|||It was a lovely experience.|

002190|231-en|en|wav/p231_074.wav|||Both men were on one-year contracts.|
002191|231-en|en|wav/p231_076.wav|||That would be too easy.|

002206|231-en|en|wav/p231_093.wav|||We must stop it with the golf ball.|
002207|231-en|en|wav/p231_094.wav|||You are like an animal.|
002208|231-en|en|wav/p231_095.wav|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
002209|231-en|en|wav/p231_097.wav|||We should recognise others have done a good job.|

002212|231-en|en|wav/p231_100.wav|||No, the equipment is extra.|
002213|231-en|en|wav/p231_101.wav|||That time is not now, however.|
002214|231-en|en|wav/p231_102.wav|||It's not a quick fix.|
002215|231-en|en|wav/p231_103.wav|||Why do it otherwise ?|

002425|231-en|en|wav/p231_320.wav|||However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|
002426|231-en|en|wav/p231_322.wav|||We want to play at the worlds.|
002427|231-en|en|wav/p231_323.wav|||However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|
002428|231-en|en|wav/p231_324.wav|||We have got no money to go anywhere.|
002429|231-en|en|wav/p231_325.wav|||Have a look at this lot.|
002430|231-en|en|wav/p231_326.wav|||That decision will be made over the next couple of days.|
002431|231-en|en|wav/p231_327.wav|||The king is delighted by the honour.|
002432|231-en|en|wav/p231_328.wav|||It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|
002433|231-en|en|wav/p231_329.wav|||The problems began a long time ago.|
002434|231-en|en|wav/p231_330.wav|||I am not sure about the rate of progress.|
002435|231-en|en|wav/p231_331.wav|||To beat the European champion is quite nice.|
002436|231-en|en|wav/p231_332.wav|||In the old days, it was easy.|
002437|231-en|en|wav/p231_333.wav|||However, the groups denied the claims.|
002438|231-en|en|wav/p231_334.wav|||She is now on the back benches.|
002439|231-en|en|wav/p231_336.wav|||I think it's about time.|
002440|231-en|en|wav/p231_337.wav|||The airport was even different.|
002441|231-en|en|wav/p231_338.wav|||There was no time scale.|
002442|231-en|en|wav/p231_339.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
002443|231-en|en|wav/p231_340.wav|||At first, the youngster was not keen.|
002444|231-en|en|wav/p231_341.wav|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
002445|231-en|en|wav/p231_342.wav|||Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|
002446|231-en|en|wav/p231_343.wav|||Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.|
002447|231-en|en|wav/p231_344.wav|||He was then replaced by Ross.|
002448|231-en|en|wav/p231_345.wav|||Finally came the moment of truth.|
002449|231-en|en|wav/p231_346.wav|||We are encouraged by the news.|
002450|231-en|en|wav/p231_347.wav|||What form did that take ?|
002451|231-en|en|wav/p231_348.wav|||Are they free ?|
002452|231-en|en|wav/p231_349.wav|||What are they for ?|
002453|231-en|en|wav/p231_350.wav|||Is there a waiting list ?|
002454|231-en|en|wav/p231_351.wav|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
002455|231-en|en|wav/p231_352.wav|||So what happens next ?|
002456|231-en|en|wav/p231_353.wav|||The units will not be replaced.|
002457|231-en|en|wav/p231_354.wav|||Neither man has been charged.|
002458|231-en|en|wav/p231_355.wav|||Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|
002459|231-en|en|wav/p231_357.wav|||Look at the Liberal Democrats.|
002460|231-en|en|wav/p231_358.wav|||I am a lucky man.|
002461|231-en|en|wav/p231_359.wav|||But they have taken the lesson to heart.|

002466|231-en|en|wav/p231_364.wav|||It is not real life.|
002467|231-en|en|wav/p231_365.wav|||Neither woman has been named.|
002468|231-en|en|wav/p231_366.wav|||They should take their mobile phones.|
002469|231-en|en|wav/p231_367.wav|||You need a licence to run a pub.|
002470|231-en|en|wav/p231_368.wav|||We regret that they're brought in the first place.|
002471|231-en|en|wav/p231_369.wav|||Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.|
002472|231-en|en|wav/p231_370.wav|||This is a major championship.|
002473|231-en|en|wav/p231_371.wav|||The result is called a patent.|
002474|231-en|en|wav/p231_372.wav|||But we finished the show.|
002475|231-en|en|wav/p231_373.wav|||They were to blame for the first two goals.|
002476|231-en|en|wav/p231_374.wav|||There is no deal as yet.|
002477|231-en|en|wav/p231_375.wav|||Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.|
002478|231-en|en|wav/p231_376.wav|||We were given a break.|
002479|231-en|en|wav/p231_377.wav|||In due course the deal was done.|
002480|231-en|en|wav/p231_378.wav|||to have products for their needs.|
002481|231-en|en|wav/p231_379.wav|||The pair are very much in love.|
002482|231-en|en|wav/p231_380.wav|||We will win the argument.|
002483|231-en|en|wav/p231_381.wav|||Had this been common practice ?|
002484|231-en|en|wav/p231_382.wav|||What do they want us to do ?|
002485|231-en|en|wav/p231_383.wav|||Is it worth it ?|
002486|231-en|en|wav/p231_384.wav|||Does it matter ?|
002487|231-en|en|wav/p231_385.wav|||You have to rely on each other.|
002488|231-en|en|wav/p231_386.wav|||The Internet is no substitute for customer service.|
002489|231-en|en|wav/p231_387.wav|||I wanted to go out on a high.|
002490|231-en|en|wav/p231_388.wav|||Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|
002491|231-en|en|wav/p231_389.wav|||That time may never be broken.|
002492|231-en|en|wav/p231_390.wav|||It was fit for royalty.|
002493|231-en|en|wav/p231_391.wav|||The response from them was good.|
002494|231-en|en|wav/p231_392.wav|||There was a substantial explosion.|
002495|231-en|en|wav/p231_393.wav|||But we are very near.|
002496|231-en|en|wav/p231_394.wav|||That's as good as it gets.|
002497|231-en|en|wav/p231_395.wav|||A review is under way.|
002498|231-en|en|wav/p231_396.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|
002499|231-en|en|wav/p231_397.wav|||This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|
002500|231-en|en|wav/p231_398.wav|||They have failed to deliver.|
002501|231-en|en|wav/p231_399.wav|||Clark is back on top form.|
002502|231-en|en|wav/p231_400.wav|||I had a fortunate war.|
002503|231-en|en|wav/p231_401.wav|||She is in their hands.|
002504|231-en|en|wav/p231_402.wav|||It is a large number.|
002505|231-en|en|wav/p231_403.wav|||It does not even have a staff shortage.|
002506|231-en|en|wav/p231_404.wav|||It is hard to understand.|
002507|231-en|en|wav/p231_405.wav|||It was a bank holiday, after all.|
002508|231-en|en|wav/p231_406.wav|||Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|
002509|231-en|en|wav/p231_407.wav|||There was an element of frustration.|
002510|231-en|en|wav/p231_408.wav|||I should think so, too.|
002511|231-en|en|wav/p231_409.wav|||How do you take them away ?|
002512|231-en|en|wav/p231_411.wav|||After the match, do you ?|
002513|231-en|en|wav/p231_412.wav|||I will always remember the horrible images.|
002514|231-en|en|wav/p231_414.wav|||They are looking for profit.|
002515|231-en|en|wav/p231_415.wav|||I remain a buyer of the shares.|
002516|231-en|en|wav/p231_416.wav|||There is some light in the tunnel.|
002517|231-en|en|wav/p231_417.wav|||He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|
002518|231-en|en|wav/p231_418.wav|||There will be widespread support on all sides.|
002519|231-en|en|wav/p231_419.wav|||The case will now go to appeal.|
002520|231-en|en|wav/p231_420.wav|||Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|
002521|231-en|en|wav/p231_421.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
002522|231-en|en|wav/p231_422.wav|||Yet the data is compelling.|
002523|231-en|en|wav/p231_423.wav|||It was important to win the singles.|
002524|231-en|en|wav/p231_424.wav|||The road was closed for several hours.|
002525|231-en|en|wav/p231_426.wav|||My aim is a top six finish.|
002526|231-en|en|wav/p231_427.wav|||I would love to think that she could win.|
002527|231-en|en|wav/p231_428.wav|||Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|
002528|231-en|en|wav/p231_429.wav|||He is on the wrong side.|
002529|231-en|en|wav/p231_430.wav|||It was a breathtaking moment.|
002530|231-en|en|wav/p231_431.wav|||I was in jail for five years.|
002531|231-en|en|wav/p231_432.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
002532|231-en|en|wav/p231_433.wav|||It is based on a true story.|
002533|231-en|en|wav/p231_434.wav|||But it can be done.|
002534|231-en|en|wav/p231_435.wav|||I never won a penny throughout my career.|
002535|231-en|en|wav/p231_436.wav|||There will be no excuses on Wednesday.|
002536|231-en|en|wav/p231_437.wav|||The growth potential is enormous.|
002537|231-en|en|wav/p231_438.wav|||They are not left wing.|
002538|231-en|en|wav/p231_439.wav|||The British government does not want to know.|
002539|231-en|en|wav/p231_440.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
002540|231-en|en|wav/p231_441.wav|||We shall not forget him.|
002541|231-en|en|wav/p231_442.wav|||The people are the hero.|
002542|231-en|en|wav/p231_443.wav|||They made a huge impression on me.|
002543|231-en|en|wav/p231_444.wav|||It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.|
002544|231-en|en|wav/p231_445.wav|||It sounded like a bomb.|
002545|231-en|en|wav/p231_446.wav|||Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|
002546|231-en|en|wav/p231_447.wav|||We've got a good management record.|
002547|231-en|en|wav/p231_448.wav|||Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.|
002548|231-en|en|wav/p231_449.wav|||And we might go back.|
002549|231-en|en|wav/p231_450.wav|||We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.|
002550|231-en|en|wav/p231_451.wav|||We went straight into the bedroom.|
002551|231-en|en|wav/p231_452.wav|||Its future is no longer in question.|
002552|231-en|en|wav/p231_453.wav|||We put our bid in last night.|
002553|231-en|en|wav/p231_454.wav|||Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.|
002554|231-en|en|wav/p231_456.wav|||They have to be met.|
002555|231-en|en|wav/p231_457.wav|||We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|
002556|231-en|en|wav/p231_458.wav|||She has reached the top of her profession.|
002557|231-en|en|wav/p231_459.wav|||But he has a lifeline.|
002558|231-en|en|wav/p231_460.wav|||A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.|
002559|231-en|en|wav/p231_461.wav|||They were good years for him.|
002560|231-en|en|wav/p231_462.wav|||Let that be their memorial.|
002561|231-en|en|wav/p231_463.wav|||Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|
002562|231-en|en|wav/p231_464.wav|||Driving has been the key.|
002563|231-en|en|wav/p231_465.wav|||She has now been registered as disabled.|
002564|231-en|en|wav/p231_466.wav|||He is well respected by his colleagues.|
002565|231-en|en|wav/p231_467.wav|||Classes must be reduced by half.|
002566|231-en|en|wav/p231_468.wav|||War is not the action.|
002567|231-en|en|wav/p231_469.wav|||However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.|
002568|231-en|en|wav/p231_470.wav|||It is too early to speculate.|
002569|231-en|en|wav/p231_471.wav|||Dennis was not so sure.|
002570|231-en|en|wav/p231_472.wav|||He felt it was the right time.|
002571|231-en|en|wav/p231_473.wav|||It was clear on Thursday.|
002572|231-en|en|wav/p231_474.wav|||The casting of her husband was an accident.|
002573|231-en|en|wav/p231_475.wav|||It was all in a short period of time.|
002574|231-en|en|wav/p231_476.wav|||That was the first time I worked with Richard.|
002575|232-en|en|wav/p232_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
002576|232-en|en|wav/p232_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
002577|232-en|en|wav/p232_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
002578|232-en|en|wav/p232_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
002579|232-en|en|wav/p232_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
002580|232-en|en|wav/p232_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
002581|232-en|en|wav/p232_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
002582|232-en|en|wav/p232_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
002583|232-en|en|wav/p232_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
002584|232-en|en|wav/p232_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
002585|232-en|en|wav/p232_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
002586|232-en|en|wav/p232_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
002587|232-en|en|wav/p232_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
002588|232-en|en|wav/p232_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
002589|232-en|en|wav/p232_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
002590|232-en|en|wav/p232_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
002591|232-en|en|wav/p232_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
002592|232-en|en|wav/p232_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
002593|232-en|en|wav/p232_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
002594|232-en|en|wav/p232_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
002595|232-en|en|wav/p232_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
002596|232-en|en|wav/p232_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
002597|232-en|en|wav/p232_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
002598|232-en|en|wav/p232_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
002599|232-en|en|wav/p232_025.wav|||Johnson was pretty low.|
002600|232-en|en|wav/p232_026.wav|||But it failed.|
002601|232-en|en|wav/p232_027.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|
002602|232-en|en|wav/p232_028.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
002603|232-en|en|wav/p232_029.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
002604|232-en|en|wav/p232_030.wav|||They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|
002605|232-en|en|wav/p232_031.wav|||It's a matter of balance.|
002606|232-en|en|wav/p232_032.wav|||They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|
002607|232-en|en|wav/p232_033.wav|||I would love it.|
002608|232-en|en|wav/p232_034.wav|||It is marvellous.|
002609|232-en|en|wav/p232_035.wav|||Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|
002610|232-en|en|wav/p232_036.wav|||But it may take some time to confirm the findings.|
002611|232-en|en|wav/p232_037.wav|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
002612|232-en|en|wav/p232_038.wav|||It was fit for royalty.|
002613|232-en|en|wav/p232_039.wav|||I was scared.|
002614|232-en|en|wav/p232_040.wav|||Dancing was her life.|
002615|232-en|en|wav/p232_041.wav|||I suspect the latter.|
002616|232-en|en|wav/p232_042.wav|||You must always attempt to raise the bar.|
002617|232-en|en|wav/p232_043.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
002618|232-en|en|wav/p232_044.wav|||We will push.|
002619|232-en|en|wav/p232_045.wav|||It is urgent.|
002620|232-en|en|wav/p232_046.wav|||The judge said.|
002621|232-en|en|wav/p232_047.wav|||It is difficult for Ali.|
002622|232-en|en|wav/p232_048.wav|||But it might have done.|
002623|232-en|en|wav/p232_049.wav|||The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|
002624|232-en|en|wav/p232_050.wav|||They had to explain it.|
002625|232-en|en|wav/p232_051.wav|||Here's a clue.|
002626|232-en|en|wav/p232_052.wav|||We were surprised to see the photograph.|
002627|232-en|en|wav/p232_053.wav|||It's the big omission.|
002628|232-en|en|wav/p232_054.wav|||Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|
002629|232-en|en|wav/p232_055.wav|||It's very odd.|
002630|232-en|en|wav/p232_056.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
002631|232-en|en|wav/p232_057.wav|||It's not pretty, but it's effective.|
002632|232-en|en|wav/p232_058.wav|||This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.|
002633|232-en|en|wav/p232_059.wav|||That's the truth.|
002634|232-en|en|wav/p232_060.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
002635|232-en|en|wav/p232_061.wav|||The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.|
002636|232-en|en|wav/p232_062.wav|||The problems are a result of that shortfall.|
002637|232-en|en|wav/p232_063.wav|||You do not change overnight.|
002638|232-en|en|wav/p232_064.wav|||People love to see this stuff.|
002639|232-en|en|wav/p232_065.wav|||He was popular.|
002640|232-en|en|wav/p232_066.wav|||I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.|
002641|232-en|en|wav/p232_067.wav|||Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|
002642|232-en|en|wav/p232_068.wav|||It is like a river running by my home.|
002643|232-en|en|wav/p232_069.wav|||We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|
002644|232-en|en|wav/p232_070.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
002645|232-en|en|wav/p232_071.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
002646|232-en|en|wav/p232_072.wav|||That was the easy election.|
002647|232-en|en|wav/p232_073.wav|||There could be a way back.|
002648|232-en|en|wav/p232_074.wav|||Then followed a bout of flu.|
002649|232-en|en|wav/p232_075.wav|||The price cuts are really exciting.|
002650|232-en|en|wav/p232_076.wav|||I had my suspicions.|
002651|232-en|en|wav/p232_077.wav|||It was chaotic.|
002652|232-en|en|wav/p232_078.wav|||It is a job creation scheme.|
002653|232-en|en|wav/p232_079.wav|||He is now resident in England.|
002654|232-en|en|wav/p232_080.wav|||I've got the shirt.|
002655|232-en|en|wav/p232_081.wav|||Today she has been released.|
002656|232-en|en|wav/p232_082.wav|||What has changed ?|
002657|232-en|en|wav/p232_083.wav|||That is bound to happen.|
002658|232-en|en|wav/p232_084.wav|||I will miss him.|
002659|232-en|en|wav/p232_085.wav|||It's all going to clear the debt.|
002660|232-en|en|wav/p232_086.wav|||She had kept the news from him.|
002661|232-en|en|wav/p232_087.wav|||No progress has been made.|
002662|232-en|en|wav/p232_088.wav|||Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|
002663|232-en|en|wav/p232_089.wav|||Now the system is right behind us.|
002664|232-en|en|wav/p232_090.wav|||Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|
002665|232-en|en|wav/p232_091.wav|||It is a lifeline.|
002666|232-en|en|wav/p232_092.wav|||Today I couldn't run on it.|
002667|232-en|en|wav/p232_093.wav|||However, it did not end that way.|
002668|232-en|en|wav/p232_094.wav|||This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|
002669|232-en|en|wav/p232_095.wav|||I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.|
002670|232-en|en|wav/p232_096.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
002671|232-en|en|wav/p232_097.wav|||The oil companies would be asked to contribute.|
002672|232-en|en|wav/p232_098.wav|||I wish I had put on a brighter tie.|
002673|232-en|en|wav/p232_099.wav|||They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.|
002674|232-en|en|wav/p232_100.wav|||It was mayhem.|
002675|232-en|en|wav/p232_101.wav|||They were outside the circle.|
002676|232-en|en|wav/p232_102.wav|||It was a good performance.|
002677|232-en|en|wav/p232_103.wav|||We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.|
002678|232-en|en|wav/p232_104.wav|||There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.|
002679|232-en|en|wav/p232_105.wav|||That is no use.|
002680|232-en|en|wav/p232_106.wav|||It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|
002681|232-en|en|wav/p232_107.wav|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
002682|232-en|en|wav/p232_108.wav|||He pleaded for caution.|
002683|232-en|en|wav/p232_109.wav|||He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.|
002684|232-en|en|wav/p232_110.wav|||I don't have many friends.|
002685|232-en|en|wav/p232_111.wav|||He was jailed for a year.|
002686|232-en|en|wav/p232_112.wav|||You had better believe it.|
002687|232-en|en|wav/p232_113.wav|||It's not fair.|
002688|232-en|en|wav/p232_114.wav|||We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.|
002689|232-en|en|wav/p232_115.wav|||Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|
002690|232-en|en|wav/p232_116.wav|||Maybe this battle has been.|
002691|232-en|en|wav/p232_117.wav|||Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.|
002692|232-en|en|wav/p232_118.wav|||Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.|
002693|232-en|en|wav/p232_119.wav|||This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.|
002694|232-en|en|wav/p232_120.wav|||It is rubbish.|
002695|232-en|en|wav/p232_121.wav|||That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.|
002696|232-en|en|wav/p232_122.wav|||The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.|
002697|232-en|en|wav/p232_123.wav|||An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.|
002698|232-en|en|wav/p232_124.wav|||That's all right then.|
002699|232-en|en|wav/p232_125.wav|||I'm so angry.|
002700|232-en|en|wav/p232_126.wav|||Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|
002701|232-en|en|wav/p232_127.wav|||It has removed a bit of guilt.|
002702|232-en|en|wav/p232_128.wav|||Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|
002703|232-en|en|wav/p232_129.wav|||The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.|
002704|232-en|en|wav/p232_130.wav|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
002705|232-en|en|wav/p232_131.wav|||That first victory made a huge difference to my career.|
002706|232-en|en|wav/p232_132.wav|||I am now unemployed.|
002707|232-en|en|wav/p232_133.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
002708|232-en|en|wav/p232_134.wav|||You've got to be vigilant.|
002709|232-en|en|wav/p232_135.wav|||Our intentions are real.|
002710|232-en|en|wav/p232_136.wav|||They took a risk.|
002711|232-en|en|wav/p232_137.wav|||The goals were good.|
002712|232-en|en|wav/p232_138.wav|||What will happen then ?|
002713|232-en|en|wav/p232_139.wav|||I am totally devoted to this job.|
002714|232-en|en|wav/p232_140.wav|||He is severe.|
002715|232-en|en|wav/p232_141.wav|||She died at her home.|
002716|232-en|en|wav/p232_142.wav|||I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.|
002717|232-en|en|wav/p232_143.wav|||They did very well.|
002718|232-en|en|wav/p232_144.wav|||The home side didn't stand a chance.|
002719|232-en|en|wav/p232_145.wav|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
002720|232-en|en|wav/p232_146.wav|||It was deployed in the Gulf War.|
002721|232-en|en|wav/p232_147.wav|||Crucially, though, United were still alive.|
002722|232-en|en|wav/p232_148.wav|||The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.|
002723|232-en|en|wav/p232_149.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
002724|232-en|en|wav/p232_150.wav|||She had gone to the Catholic school.|
002725|232-en|en|wav/p232_151.wav|||It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.|
002726|232-en|en|wav/p232_152.wav|||It was by the numbers.|
002727|232-en|en|wav/p232_153.wav|||I was in daily contact.|
002728|232-en|en|wav/p232_154.wav|||They were later discharged from hospital.|
002729|232-en|en|wav/p232_155.wav|||This latter point is hugely important.|
002730|232-en|en|wav/p232_156.wav|||It is an attitude of mind.|
002731|232-en|en|wav/p232_158.wav|||They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.|
002732|232-en|en|wav/p232_159.wav|||We have to move forward.|
002733|232-en|en|wav/p232_160.wav|||Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.|
002734|232-en|en|wav/p232_161.wav|||We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.|
002735|232-en|en|wav/p232_162.wav|||Tell it like it was ?|
002736|232-en|en|wav/p232_163.wav|||It is not too late to get on board.|
002737|232-en|en|wav/p232_164.wav|||That must be left to the Parole Board.|
002738|232-en|en|wav/p232_165.wav|||Again, we were lucky.|
002739|232-en|en|wav/p232_166.wav|||Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.|
002740|232-en|en|wav/p232_167.wav|||Waiting times for these services are too long.|
002741|232-en|en|wav/p232_168.wav|||That will do for me.|
002742|232-en|en|wav/p232_169.wav|||It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.|
002743|232-en|en|wav/p232_170.wav|||We've made a couple of albums.|
002744|232-en|en|wav/p232_171.wav|||My life has been destroyed.|
002745|232-en|en|wav/p232_172.wav|||They thought they had found a home.|
002746|232-en|en|wav/p232_173.wav|||It became a book by itself.|
002747|232-en|en|wav/p232_174.wav|||I always felt they played for me.|
002748|232-en|en|wav/p232_175.wav|||You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.|
002749|232-en|en|wav/p232_176.wav|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
002750|232-en|en|wav/p232_177.wav|||Blair's response was weak.|
002751|232-en|en|wav/p232_178.wav|||It's the real thing, for sure.|
002752|232-en|en|wav/p232_179.wav|||However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.|
002753|232-en|en|wav/p232_180.wav|||The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.|
002754|232-en|en|wav/p232_181.wav|||The clarity is vital.|
002755|232-en|en|wav/p232_182.wav|||I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.|
002756|232-en|en|wav/p232_183.wav|||Everyone can be bought.|
002757|232-en|en|wav/p232_184.wav|||A career as a doctor is on hold.|
002758|232-en|en|wav/p232_185.wav|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
002759|232-en|en|wav/p232_186.wav|||It is the whole package.|
002760|232-en|en|wav/p232_187.wav|||I've been there.|
002761|232-en|en|wav/p232_188.wav|||Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|
002762|232-en|en|wav/p232_189.wav|||They receive a high profile in the media.|
002763|232-en|en|wav/p232_190.wav|||We did everything by the book.|
002764|232-en|en|wav/p232_191.wav|||I wish I could say something.|
002765|232-en|en|wav/p232_192.wav|||Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.|
002766|232-en|en|wav/p232_193.wav|||The procedure is the same in all cases.|
002767|232-en|en|wav/p232_194.wav|||But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.|
002768|232-en|en|wav/p232_195.wav|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
002769|232-en|en|wav/p232_196.wav|||I came home by ambulance.|
002770|232-en|en|wav/p232_197.wav|||The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.|
002771|232-en|en|wav/p232_198.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
002772|232-en|en|wav/p232_199.wav|||The service from the other players was super.|
002773|232-en|en|wav/p232_200.wav|||He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.|
002774|232-en|en|wav/p232_201.wav|||On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|
002775|232-en|en|wav/p232_202.wav|||The sisters also became the top two players in the world.|
002776|232-en|en|wav/p232_203.wav|||A deadline is still essential.|
002777|232-en|en|wav/p232_204.wav|||We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.|
002778|232-en|en|wav/p232_205.wav|||It's a mixture of everything.|
002779|232-en|en|wav/p232_206.wav|||We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|
002780|232-en|en|wav/p232_207.wav|||I don't want to use it.|
002781|232-en|en|wav/p232_208.wav|||Now, it's all right.|
002782|232-en|en|wav/p232_209.wav|||There was an e-mail.|
002783|232-en|en|wav/p232_210.wav|||That's the day job.|
002784|232-en|en|wav/p232_211.wav|||Feel the heat ?|
002785|232-en|en|wav/p232_212.wav|||He knows a lot.|
002786|232-en|en|wav/p232_213.wav|||He is slightly confused.|
002787|232-en|en|wav/p232_214.wav|||She should not be blamed.|
002788|232-en|en|wav/p232_215.wav|||His third goal was superb.|
002789|232-en|en|wav/p232_216.wav|||He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|
002790|232-en|en|wav/p232_217.wav|||It's not ideal.|
002791|232-en|en|wav/p232_218.wav|||He seemed to lose his focus.|
002792|232-en|en|wav/p232_219.wav|||He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.|
002793|232-en|en|wav/p232_220.wav|||The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.|
002794|232-en|en|wav/p232_221.wav|||Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.|
002795|232-en|en|wav/p232_223.wav|||It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.|
002796|232-en|en|wav/p232_224.wav|||That has been the easy part.|
002797|232-en|en|wav/p232_225.wav|||We've got the bronze.|
002798|232-en|en|wav/p232_226.wav|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
002799|232-en|en|wav/p232_227.wav|||At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.|
002800|232-en|en|wav/p232_228.wav|||It was good fun.|
002801|232-en|en|wav/p232_229.wav|||What was the main difference ?|
002802|232-en|en|wav/p232_230.wav|||I am immensely sad.|
002803|232-en|en|wav/p232_231.wav|||I'd never seen a play about me.|
002804|232-en|en|wav/p232_232.wav|||It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.|
002805|232-en|en|wav/p232_233.wav|||The track is currently covered in snow.|
002806|232-en|en|wav/p232_234.wav|||But she was.|
002807|232-en|en|wav/p232_235.wav|||Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.|
002808|232-en|en|wav/p232_236.wav|||We were awful.|
002809|232-en|en|wav/p232_237.wav|||However, no further action was taken by police.|
002810|232-en|en|wav/p232_238.wav|||And thought we would get away with it.|
002811|232-en|en|wav/p232_239.wav|||It is set in Paris.|
002812|232-en|en|wav/p232_240.wav|||The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.|
002813|232-en|en|wav/p232_241.wav|||It's quite nice.|
002814|232-en|en|wav/p232_242.wav|||It's quite a line-up!|
002815|232-en|en|wav/p232_243.wav|||It's a lovely, lovely film.|
002816|232-en|en|wav/p232_244.wav|||The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.|
002817|232-en|en|wav/p232_245.wav|||Broke the birdie record.|
002818|232-en|en|wav/p232_246.wav|||He claimed the government had lost the plot.|
002819|232-en|en|wav/p232_247.wav|||She is well balanced.|
002820|232-en|en|wav/p232_248.wav|||A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|
002821|232-en|en|wav/p232_249.wav|||Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.|
002822|232-en|en|wav/p232_250.wav|||He says that he is no different from any other man.|
002823|232-en|en|wav/p232_251.wav|||Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.|
002824|232-en|en|wav/p232_252.wav|||We did not compete with any other local farmer.|
002825|232-en|en|wav/p232_253.wav|||I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.|
002826|232-en|en|wav/p232_254.wav|||Some families have even requested to leave the city.|
002827|232-en|en|wav/p232_255.wav|||It's a record label, not a form of music.|

002913|232-en|en|wav/p232_342.wav|||That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.|

002935|232-en|en|wav/p232_364.wav|||It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.|
002936|232-en|en|wav/p232_365.wav|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
002937|232-en|en|wav/p232_366.wav|||It benefits the whole family.|
002938|232-en|en|wav/p232_367.wav|||He has seen the past.|
002939|232-en|en|wav/p232_368.wav|||It was one in the afternoon.|
002940|232-en|en|wav/p232_369.wav|||To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.|

002957|232-en|en|wav/p232_386.wav|||That left a bad taste in my mouth.|
002958|232-en|en|wav/p232_387.wav|||It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.|
002959|232-en|en|wav/p232_388.wav|||Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|
002960|232-en|en|wav/p232_389.wav|||It has moved on in the last week.|
002961|232-en|en|wav/p232_390.wav|||That's the name of the game, though.|
002962|232-en|en|wav/p232_391.wav|||You thought it was a headache.|
002963|232-en|en|wav/p232_392.wav|||Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|
002964|232-en|en|wav/p232_393.wav|||A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|

002990|233-en|en|wav/p233_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
002991|233-en|en|wav/p233_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
002992|233-en|en|wav/p233_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
002993|233-en|en|wav/p233_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
002994|233-en|en|wav/p233_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
002995|233-en|en|wav/p233_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
002996|233-en|en|wav/p233_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
002997|233-en|en|wav/p233_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
002998|233-en|en|wav/p233_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
002999|233-en|en|wav/p233_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
003000|233-en|en|wav/p233_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
003001|233-en|en|wav/p233_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
003002|233-en|en|wav/p233_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
003003|233-en|en|wav/p233_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
003004|233-en|en|wav/p233_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
003005|233-en|en|wav/p233_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
003006|233-en|en|wav/p233_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
003007|233-en|en|wav/p233_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
003008|233-en|en|wav/p233_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
003009|233-en|en|wav/p233_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
003010|233-en|en|wav/p233_025.wav|||We are a service industry.|
003011|233-en|en|wav/p233_026.wav|||But we will have to wait.|

003329|233-en|en|wav/p233_361.wav|||They have not done so this season so far.|
003330|233-en|en|wav/p233_362.wav|||This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|
003331|233-en|en|wav/p233_363.wav|||Safety was also an issue.|
003332|233-en|en|wav/p233_364.wav|||They received a reply from their own managers.|

003347|233-en|en|wav/p233_381.wav|||It's just outrageous.|
003348|233-en|en|wav/p233_382.wav|||The road was closed for several hours.|
003349|233-en|en|wav/p233_383.wav|||It is unusual.|
003350|233-en|en|wav/p233_384.wav|||That will come after the game on Saturday.|
003351|233-en|en|wav/p233_385.wav|||The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|
003352|233-en|en|wav/p233_386.wav|||That set the tone.|
003353|233-en|en|wav/p233_387.wav|||It was a breathtaking moment.|
003354|233-en|en|wav/p233_388.wav|||I was in jail for five years.|

003361|234-en|en|wav/p234_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
003362|234-en|en|wav/p234_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
003363|234-en|en|wav/p234_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
003364|234-en|en|wav/p234_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
003365|234-en|en|wav/p234_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
003366|234-en|en|wav/p234_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
003367|234-en|en|wav/p234_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
003368|234-en|en|wav/p234_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
003369|234-en|en|wav/p234_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
003370|234-en|en|wav/p234_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
003371|234-en|en|wav/p234_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
003372|234-en|en|wav/p234_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
003373|234-en|en|wav/p234_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
003374|234-en|en|wav/p234_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
003375|234-en|en|wav/p234_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
003376|234-en|en|wav/p234_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
003377|234-en|en|wav/p234_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
003378|234-en|en|wav/p234_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
003379|234-en|en|wav/p234_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
003380|234-en|en|wav/p234_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
003381|234-en|en|wav/p234_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
003382|234-en|en|wav/p234_025.wav|||We are a service industry.|
003383|234-en|en|wav/p234_026.wav|||But we will have to wait.|
003384|234-en|en|wav/p234_027.wav|||Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|
003385|234-en|en|wav/p234_028.wav|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
003386|234-en|en|wav/p234_029.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
003387|234-en|en|wav/p234_030.wav|||On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|
003388|234-en|en|wav/p234_031.wav|||It is on the internet.|
003389|234-en|en|wav/p234_032.wav|||Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|
003390|234-en|en|wav/p234_033.wav|||This is a central issue.|
003391|234-en|en|wav/p234_034.wav|||It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|
003392|234-en|en|wav/p234_035.wav|||History is in the making.|
003393|234-en|en|wav/p234_036.wav|||It was sold at a loss.|
003394|234-en|en|wav/p234_037.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
003395|234-en|en|wav/p234_038.wav|||Victory was never in doubt.|
003396|234-en|en|wav/p234_039.wav|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
003397|234-en|en|wav/p234_040.wav|||We are the party of the future.|
003398|234-en|en|wav/p234_041.wav|||I have never been a member of the council.|
003399|234-en|en|wav/p234_042.wav|||He was in his element.|
003400|234-en|en|wav/p234_043.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
003401|234-en|en|wav/p234_044.wav|||At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|
003402|234-en|en|wav/p234_045.wav|||All businesses continue to trade.|
003403|234-en|en|wav/p234_046.wav|||The man became a reporter.|
003404|234-en|en|wav/p234_047.wav|||It depends on the decisions of the member states.|
003405|234-en|en|wav/p234_048.wav|||It is all starting to come together.|
003406|234-en|en|wav/p234_049.wav|||Part of the complex is historic.|
003407|234-en|en|wav/p234_050.wav|||The strategy is not without risk.|
003408|234-en|en|wav/p234_051.wav|||But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|
003409|234-en|en|wav/p234_052.wav|||I was released after six days.|
003410|234-en|en|wav/p234_053.wav|||Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|
003411|234-en|en|wav/p234_054.wav|||We are working on it.|
003412|234-en|en|wav/p234_055.wav|||I've never been one for complaining about the press.|
003413|234-en|en|wav/p234_056.wav|||This trend is likely to strengthen.|
003414|234-en|en|wav/p234_057.wav|||Still, he did not let himself down this week.|
003415|234-en|en|wav/p234_058.wav|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
003416|234-en|en|wav/p234_059.wav|||There was no safety net.|
003417|234-en|en|wav/p234_060.wav|||He looks as if he could be worth the risk.|
003418|234-en|en|wav/p234_061.wav|||You have to be patient.|
003419|234-en|en|wav/p234_062.wav|||That is all in the past.|
003420|234-en|en|wav/p234_063.wav|||That could be a mistake.|
003421|234-en|en|wav/p234_064.wav|||It was an amazing result.|
003422|234-en|en|wav/p234_065.wav|||Indeed, it is only the beginning.|
003423|234-en|en|wav/p234_066.wav|||He has not been dropped.|

003425|234-en|en|wav/p234_068.wav|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
003426|234-en|en|wav/p234_069.wav|||The market is appalling for initial public offerings.|
003427|234-en|en|wav/p234_070.wav|||This time, it might be for real.|
003428|234-en|en|wav/p234_071.wav|||She did that for the rest of her life.|
003429|234-en|en|wav/p234_072.wav|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
003430|234-en|en|wav/p234_073.wav|||It starts with the script.|
003431|234-en|en|wav/p234_074.wav|||We were under a bit of pressure.|
003432|234-en|en|wav/p234_075.wav|||The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|
003433|234-en|en|wav/p234_076.wav|||We can all make a mistake.|
003434|234-en|en|wav/p234_077.wav|||Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.|
003435|234-en|en|wav/p234_079.wav|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
003436|234-en|en|wav/p234_080.wav|||On the night, it was not enough.|
003437|234-en|en|wav/p234_081.wav|||It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|
003438|234-en|en|wav/p234_082.wav|||However, a ruling will not come before next week.|
003439|234-en|en|wav/p234_083.wav|||They were badly prepared for it.|
003440|234-en|en|wav/p234_084.wav|||It is not a story.|
003441|234-en|en|wav/p234_085.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
003442|234-en|en|wav/p234_086.wav|||How are you, sir ?|
003443|234-en|en|wav/p234_087.wav|||So is that it, then ?|
003444|234-en|en|wav/p234_088.wav|||Do I have a favourite ?|
003445|234-en|en|wav/p234_089.wav|||What do we do ?|
003446|234-en|en|wav/p234_090.wav|||Why do it otherwise ?|
003447|234-en|en|wav/p234_091.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
003448|234-en|en|wav/p234_092.wav|||They have a further report to make in March.|
003449|234-en|en|wav/p234_093.wav|||He is in the US.|
003450|234-en|en|wav/p234_094.wav|||The Festival is prepared to help.|
003451|234-en|en|wav/p234_095.wav|||By then, he was walking on water.|
003452|234-en|en|wav/p234_096.wav|||I had a bit in hand.|
003453|234-en|en|wav/p234_097.wav|||We have to have a full statement to Parliament.|
003454|234-en|en|wav/p234_098.wav|||I cannot wait to get started on it.|
003455|234-en|en|wav/p234_099.wav|||That is the fact of the matter.|
003456|234-en|en|wav/p234_100.wav|||It should be a condition of employment.|
003457|234-en|en|wav/p234_101.wav|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
003458|234-en|en|wav/p234_102.wav|||It is much as it has been described.|
003459|234-en|en|wav/p234_103.wav|||Police said the family was helping with the search.|
003460|234-en|en|wav/p234_104.wav|||She was there for the start of the campaign.|
003461|234-en|en|wav/p234_105.wav|||He has become a monster.|
003462|234-en|en|wav/p234_106.wav|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
003463|234-en|en|wav/p234_107.wav|||Everyone had to play the game.|
003464|234-en|en|wav/p234_108.wav|||In London today, it was business as usual.|
003465|234-en|en|wav/p234_109.wav|||It is not affected by the sale.|
003466|234-en|en|wav/p234_110.wav|||We are currently working on the details.|
003467|234-en|en|wav/p234_111.wav|||That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.|
003468|234-en|en|wav/p234_112.wav|||That would be a serious problem.|
003469|234-en|en|wav/p234_113.wav|||Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.|
003470|234-en|en|wav/p234_114.wav|||People have been placed in a state of alarm.|
003471|234-en|en|wav/p234_115.wav|||She is not a victim.|
003472|234-en|en|wav/p234_116.wav|||A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|
003473|234-en|en|wav/p234_117.wav|||And we had a good response.|
003474|234-en|en|wav/p234_118.wav|||When we looked at the company.|
003475|234-en|en|wav/p234_119.wav|||No, the equipment is extra.|
003476|234-en|en|wav/p234_120.wav|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
003477|234-en|en|wav/p234_121.wav|||The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|
003478|234-en|en|wav/p234_122.wav|||That admission is not surprising.|
003479|234-en|en|wav/p234_123.wav|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
003480|234-en|en|wav/p234_124.wav|||According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|
003481|234-en|en|wav/p234_125.wav|||There was a lot of resentment.|
003482|234-en|en|wav/p234_126.wav|||He wanted to record the group.|
003483|234-en|en|wav/p234_127.wav|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
003484|234-en|en|wav/p234_128.wav|||The end result is the same.|
003485|234-en|en|wav/p234_129.wav|||Three days later, he was killed.|
003486|234-en|en|wav/p234_130.wav|||We are committed to the ban.|
003487|234-en|en|wav/p234_131.wav|||However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|
003488|234-en|en|wav/p234_132.wav|||The problem was a social problem.|
003489|234-en|en|wav/p234_133.wav|||He had no money left to run the club.|
003490|234-en|en|wav/p234_134.wav|||It is not so simple.|
003491|234-en|en|wav/p234_135.wav|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
003492|234-en|en|wav/p234_136.wav|||So, did she meet him ?|
003493|234-en|en|wav/p234_137.wav|||So what is the campaign about ?|
003494|234-en|en|wav/p234_138.wav|||And does it ?|
003495|234-en|en|wav/p234_139.wav|||Are you from the rugby ?|
003496|234-en|en|wav/p234_140.wav|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
003497|234-en|en|wav/p234_141.wav|||When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|
003498|234-en|en|wav/p234_142.wav|||They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|
003499|234-en|en|wav/p234_143.wav|||Here, again, they were denied a voice.|
003500|234-en|en|wav/p234_144.wav|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
003501|234-en|en|wav/p234_145.wav|||I can't even get into the A team.|
003502|234-en|en|wav/p234_146.wav|||In addition, investor choice is reduced.|
003503|234-en|en|wav/p234_147.wav|||She does not want to speak.|
003504|234-en|en|wav/p234_148.wav|||It is expected to last a week.|
003505|234-en|en|wav/p234_149.wav|||Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|
003506|234-en|en|wav/p234_150.wav|||It is too pretty, it is too small.|
003507|234-en|en|wav/p234_151.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
003508|234-en|en|wav/p234_152.wav|||But it is different in different regions.|
003509|234-en|en|wav/p234_153.wav|||That is the nature of the game.|
003510|234-en|en|wav/p234_154.wav|||There is a spring in the step.|
003511|234-en|en|wav/p234_155.wav|||We want to get there.|
003512|234-en|en|wav/p234_156.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
003513|234-en|en|wav/p234_157.wav|||I have a lot of confidence in this team.|
003514|234-en|en|wav/p234_158.wav|||The players were under pressure.|
003515|234-en|en|wav/p234_159.wav|||Not that the occasion was without restraint.|
003516|234-en|en|wav/p234_160.wav|||There is no common ground.|
003517|234-en|en|wav/p234_161.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
003518|234-en|en|wav/p234_162.wav|||In that case, the children were not missing.|
003519|234-en|en|wav/p234_163.wav|||Frankly, it was worth the booking.|
003520|234-en|en|wav/p234_164.wav|||Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|
003521|234-en|en|wav/p234_165.wav|||Anyone can do the sums.|
003522|234-en|en|wav/p234_166.wav|||At the moment we do not understand it.|
003523|234-en|en|wav/p234_167.wav|||So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|
003524|234-en|en|wav/p234_168.wav|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
003525|234-en|en|wav/p234_169.wav|||Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.|
003526|234-en|en|wav/p234_170.wav|||Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|
003527|234-en|en|wav/p234_171.wav|||Much of the equipment was new.|
003528|234-en|en|wav/p234_172.wav|||I have had a good life.|
003529|234-en|en|wav/p234_173.wav|||Three hours later, the man was free.|
003530|234-en|en|wav/p234_174.wav|||That was the difference between the sides.|
003531|234-en|en|wav/p234_175.wav|||They have not been named.|
003532|234-en|en|wav/p234_176.wav|||I was in a hole.|
003533|234-en|en|wav/p234_177.wav|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
003534|234-en|en|wav/p234_178.wav|||I was always in control.|
003535|234-en|en|wav/p234_179.wav|||I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.|
003536|234-en|en|wav/p234_180.wav|||For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.|
003537|234-en|en|wav/p234_181.wav|||He was asked to quit.|
003538|234-en|en|wav/p234_182.wav|||There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.|
003539|234-en|en|wav/p234_183.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
003540|234-en|en|wav/p234_184.wav|||They were not seeking the right to strike.|
003541|234-en|en|wav/p234_185.wav|||He called for a public inquiry.|
003542|234-en|en|wav/p234_186.wav|||Tony Blair has had a good conference.|
003543|234-en|en|wav/p234_187.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
003544|234-en|en|wav/p234_188.wav|||By then, however, both men were already in the US.|
003545|234-en|en|wav/p234_189.wav|||It is simply not true.|
003546|234-en|en|wav/p234_190.wav|||In light of things, I think I made the right decision.|
003547|234-en|en|wav/p234_191.wav|||It is not in the public interest.|
003548|234-en|en|wav/p234_192.wav|||Well, this article is a bit like that.|
003549|234-en|en|wav/p234_193.wav|||The performance is not there.|
003550|234-en|en|wav/p234_194.wav|||It would make a lot of sense.|
003551|234-en|en|wav/p234_195.wav|||At that point, the structure of the board was changed.|
003552|234-en|en|wav/p234_196.wav|||Clearly, they had other problems.|
003553|234-en|en|wav/p234_197.wav|||He has defended the system.|
003554|234-en|en|wav/p234_198.wav|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
003555|234-en|en|wav/p234_199.wav|||I could not sit in the stands.|
003556|234-en|en|wav/p234_200.wav|||At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|
003557|234-en|en|wav/p234_201.wav|||They have to get that sorted.|
003558|234-en|en|wav/p234_202.wav|||Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.|
003559|234-en|en|wav/p234_203.wav|||We can take the city.|
003560|234-en|en|wav/p234_204.wav|||Are you going to win ?|
003561|234-en|en|wav/p234_205.wav|||Was it the wife ?|
003562|234-en|en|wav/p234_207.wav|||What do we want to do that for ?|
003563|234-en|en|wav/p234_208.wav|||Does the name matter ?|
003564|234-en|en|wav/p234_209.wav|||I will be in Scotland.|
003565|234-en|en|wav/p234_210.wav|||It was the story of the second half.|
003566|234-en|en|wav/p234_211.wav|||The trading conditions are not good.|
003567|234-en|en|wav/p234_212.wav|||It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|
003568|234-en|en|wav/p234_213.wav|||Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.|
003569|234-en|en|wav/p234_214.wav|||This is an interesting link.|
003570|234-en|en|wav/p234_216.wav|||It was a management problem in the hospital.|
003571|234-en|en|wav/p234_217.wav|||Being investor ready is a good start.|
003572|234-en|en|wav/p234_218.wav|||Last night, the company could not be contacted.|
003573|234-en|en|wav/p234_219.wav|||I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|
003574|234-en|en|wav/p234_220.wav|||This conference was never confirmed.|
003575|234-en|en|wav/p234_221.wav|||However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|
003576|234-en|en|wav/p234_222.wav|||We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.|
003577|234-en|en|wav/p234_223.wav|||He must have a crack at it.|
003578|234-en|en|wav/p234_224.wav|||The force is with them.|
003579|234-en|en|wav/p234_225.wav|||Her experience is certainly limited.|
003580|234-en|en|wav/p234_226.wav|||The deal is expected to be completed by September.|
003581|234-en|en|wav/p234_227.wav|||However, he said the money had not been wasted.|
003582|234-en|en|wav/p234_228.wav|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
003583|234-en|en|wav/p234_229.wav|||We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.|
003584|234-en|en|wav/p234_230.wav|||He intends to restart in the spring.|
003585|234-en|en|wav/p234_231.wav|||He is a good friend.|
003586|234-en|en|wav/p234_232.wav|||It is the strength of the school.|
003587|234-en|en|wav/p234_233.wav|||But it may not be all bad news.|
003588|234-en|en|wav/p234_234.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
003589|234-en|en|wav/p234_235.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
003590|234-en|en|wav/p234_236.wav|||Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|
003591|234-en|en|wav/p234_237.wav|||But we are not immune to the problem.|
003592|234-en|en|wav/p234_238.wav|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
003593|234-en|en|wav/p234_239.wav|||However, it is not as simple as this.|
003594|234-en|en|wav/p234_240.wav|||On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.|
003595|234-en|en|wav/p234_241.wav|||A deadline is still essential.|
003596|234-en|en|wav/p234_242.wav|||And they were being paid ?|
003597|234-en|en|wav/p234_243.wav|||Was everything done to save people ?|
003598|234-en|en|wav/p234_244.wav|||What was the matter for concern ?|
003599|234-en|en|wav/p234_245.wav|||Do I think about them often ?|
003600|234-en|en|wav/p234_246.wav|||Is it in the right place ?|
003601|234-en|en|wav/p234_247.wav|||Did he trip ?|
003602|234-en|en|wav/p234_248.wav|||I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|
003603|234-en|en|wav/p234_249.wav|||You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.|
003604|234-en|en|wav/p234_250.wav|||We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|
003605|234-en|en|wav/p234_251.wav|||We have an election in eight days.|
003606|234-en|en|wav/p234_252.wav|||It was far from business as usual.|
003607|234-en|en|wav/p234_253.wav|||It was just another play.|
003608|234-en|en|wav/p234_254.wav|||From there, they can go anywhere.|
003609|234-en|en|wav/p234_255.wav|||The world is a good place.|
003610|234-en|en|wav/p234_256.wav|||This is a sensible and common sense approach.|
003611|234-en|en|wav/p234_257.wav|||The matter is under appeal.|
003612|234-en|en|wav/p234_258.wav|||I am delighted for them.|
003613|234-en|en|wav/p234_259.wav|||It was a great experience.|
003614|234-en|en|wav/p234_260.wav|||They are difficult awards to decide.|
003615|234-en|en|wav/p234_261.wav|||Anyway, the job will be part-time.|
003616|234-en|en|wav/p234_262.wav|||His second was a beauty.|
003617|234-en|en|wav/p234_263.wav|||However, Dundee deserved to win this game.|
003618|234-en|en|wav/p234_264.wav|||Scotland played a major part in the project.|
003619|234-en|en|wav/p234_265.wav|||Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|
003620|234-en|en|wav/p234_266.wav|||Not in this production he doesn't.|
003621|234-en|en|wav/p234_267.wav|||We can certainly build on this.|
003622|234-en|en|wav/p234_268.wav|||Then was the summer of their discontent.|
003623|234-en|en|wav/p234_269.wav|||There is a world of difference.|
003624|234-en|en|wav/p234_270.wav|||This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|
003625|234-en|en|wav/p234_271.wav|||Well, it was certainly different.|
003626|234-en|en|wav/p234_272.wav|||We want this place to work.|
003627|234-en|en|wav/p234_273.wav|||Clearly, the stakes are high.|
003628|234-en|en|wav/p234_274.wav|||So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|
003629|234-en|en|wav/p234_275.wav|||The statement contained no surprises.|
003630|234-en|en|wav/p234_276.wav|||The performance continues to improve.|
003631|234-en|en|wav/p234_277.wav|||That would be a danger.|
003632|234-en|en|wav/p234_278.wav|||Frankly, we were lucky to get second.|
003633|234-en|en|wav/p234_279.wav|||However, no further action was taken by police.|
003634|234-en|en|wav/p234_280.wav|||It depends on Labour, not on us.|
003635|234-en|en|wav/p234_281.wav|||I had to be into it.|
003636|234-en|en|wav/p234_282.wav|||My view has always been the same.|
003637|234-en|en|wav/p234_283.wav|||In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.|
003638|234-en|en|wav/p234_284.wav|||It is set in Paris.|
003639|234-en|en|wav/p234_285.wav|||Do you think we're a top nation ?|
003640|234-en|en|wav/p234_286.wav|||Is our children learning ?|
003641|234-en|en|wav/p234_287.wav|||How independent is that ?|
003642|234-en|en|wav/p234_288.wav|||What form did that take ?|
003643|234-en|en|wav/p234_289.wav|||Are they free ?|
003644|234-en|en|wav/p234_290.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
003645|234-en|en|wav/p234_291.wav|||In many ways, that is as important.|
003646|234-en|en|wav/p234_292.wav|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
003647|234-en|en|wav/p234_293.wav|||It is not an option, but a policy requirement.|
003648|234-en|en|wav/p234_294.wav|||Of further privacy, he had no need.|
003649|234-en|en|wav/p234_295.wav|||He was good, but not that good.|
003650|234-en|en|wav/p234_296.wav|||The results are expected within days.|
003651|234-en|en|wav/p234_297.wav|||The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|
003652|234-en|en|wav/p234_298.wav|||Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|
003653|234-en|en|wav/p234_299.wav|||We were well worth the win.|
003654|234-en|en|wav/p234_300.wav|||And it was this one.|
003655|234-en|en|wav/p234_301.wav|||But that's another story for another day.|
003656|234-en|en|wav/p234_302.wav|||But it was also hard.|
003657|234-en|en|wav/p234_303.wav|||If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|
003658|234-en|en|wav/p234_304.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
003659|234-en|en|wav/p234_305.wav|||By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.|
003660|234-en|en|wav/p234_306.wav|||They are not going the length of the pitch.|
003661|234-en|en|wav/p234_307.wav|||However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.|
003662|234-en|en|wav/p234_308.wav|||The concerns are the same.|
003663|234-en|en|wav/p234_309.wav|||That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.|
003664|234-en|en|wav/p234_310.wav|||Scotland won by six wickets.|
003665|234-en|en|wav/p234_311.wav|||It has to be enforced.|
003666|234-en|en|wav/p234_312.wav|||And we can do it.|
003667|234-en|en|wav/p234_313.wav|||Every one is a winner.|
003668|234-en|en|wav/p234_314.wav|||Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.|
003669|234-en|en|wav/p234_315.wav|||They have set the standard.|
003670|234-en|en|wav/p234_316.wav|||This is a major property in Edinburgh.|
003671|234-en|en|wav/p234_317.wav|||It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|
003672|234-en|en|wav/p234_318.wav|||The existing structure is in trouble.|
003673|234-en|en|wav/p234_319.wav|||It all started with a visiting rugby club.|
003674|234-en|en|wav/p234_320.wav|||He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.|
003675|234-en|en|wav/p234_321.wav|||You have to count on other people.|
003676|234-en|en|wav/p234_322.wav|||Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.|
003677|234-en|en|wav/p234_323.wav|||And he's the real thing.|
003678|234-en|en|wav/p234_324.wav|||What are they for ?|
003679|234-en|en|wav/p234_325.wav|||Is there a waiting list ?|
003680|234-en|en|wav/p234_326.wav|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
003681|234-en|en|wav/p234_327.wav|||But it is important for a number of reasons.|
003682|234-en|en|wav/p234_328.wav|||All of the management has invested in the firm.|
003683|234-en|en|wav/p234_329.wav|||The family is not interested in the value of the house.|
003684|234-en|en|wav/p234_330.wav|||It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|
003685|234-en|en|wav/p234_331.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
003686|234-en|en|wav/p234_332.wav|||But it can be done.|
003687|234-en|en|wav/p234_333.wav|||Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.|
003688|234-en|en|wav/p234_334.wav|||We have to be very, very careful.|
003689|234-en|en|wav/p234_335.wav|||In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|
003690|234-en|en|wav/p234_336.wav|||This could be a mistake.|
003691|234-en|en|wav/p234_337.wav|||Hopefully, this week will be good.|
003692|234-en|en|wav/p234_338.wav|||Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|
003693|234-en|en|wav/p234_339.wav|||I think the overall picture is still strong.|
003694|234-en|en|wav/p234_340.wav|||That is always a problem.|
003695|234-en|en|wav/p234_341.wav|||We will deliver at director level.|
003696|234-en|en|wav/p234_342.wav|||We did something about it.|
003697|234-en|en|wav/p234_343.wav|||The market is the market.|
003698|234-en|en|wav/p234_344.wav|||We do not have the papers.|
003699|234-en|en|wav/p234_345.wav|||However, the devil is in the detail.|
003700|234-en|en|wav/p234_346.wav|||For the moment, however, the position is clear.|
003701|234-en|en|wav/p234_347.wav|||The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|
003702|234-en|en|wav/p234_348.wav|||The answer was in space.|
003703|234-en|en|wav/p234_349.wav|||We are not interested in dividends.|
003704|234-en|en|wav/p234_350.wav|||Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|
003705|234-en|en|wav/p234_351.wav|||His concern is only for the future.|
003706|234-en|en|wav/p234_352.wav|||And it's a goodbye from him.|
003707|234-en|en|wav/p234_353.wav|||They have to be addressed.|
003708|234-en|en|wav/p234_354.wav|||If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.|
003709|234-en|en|wav/p234_355.wav|||However, a bid was never made.|
003710|234-en|en|wav/p234_356.wav|||That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|
003711|234-en|en|wav/p234_357.wav|||The City welcomed the numbers.|
003712|234-en|en|wav/p234_358.wav|||Something is going to have to give.|
003713|234-en|en|wav/p234_359.wav|||There's still a bit to go.|
003714|234-en|en|wav/p234_360.wav|||They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.|
003715|234-en|en|wav/p234_361.wav|||We never played at all.|
003716|237-en|en|wav/p237_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
003717|237-en|en|wav/p237_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
003718|237-en|en|wav/p237_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
003719|237-en|en|wav/p237_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
003720|237-en|en|wav/p237_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
003721|237-en|en|wav/p237_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
003722|237-en|en|wav/p237_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
003723|237-en|en|wav/p237_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
003724|237-en|en|wav/p237_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
003725|237-en|en|wav/p237_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
003726|237-en|en|wav/p237_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
003727|237-en|en|wav/p237_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
003728|237-en|en|wav/p237_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
003729|237-en|en|wav/p237_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
003730|237-en|en|wav/p237_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
003731|237-en|en|wav/p237_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
003732|237-en|en|wav/p237_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
003733|237-en|en|wav/p237_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
003734|237-en|en|wav/p237_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
003735|237-en|en|wav/p237_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
003736|237-en|en|wav/p237_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
003737|237-en|en|wav/p237_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
003738|237-en|en|wav/p237_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
003739|237-en|en|wav/p237_025.wav|||He said the matter had been neglected in the past.|
003740|237-en|en|wav/p237_026.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
003741|237-en|en|wav/p237_027.wav|||I have a theory.|
003742|237-en|en|wav/p237_028.wav|||They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.|
003743|237-en|en|wav/p237_029.wav|||The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.|
003744|237-en|en|wav/p237_030.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
003745|237-en|en|wav/p237_031.wav|||We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.|
003746|237-en|en|wav/p237_032.wav|||There's a story, too.|
003747|237-en|en|wav/p237_033.wav|||This is the window.|
003748|237-en|en|wav/p237_034.wav|||I think a move would create a lot of interest.|
003749|237-en|en|wav/p237_035.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
003750|237-en|en|wav/p237_036.wav|||They're just different.|
003751|237-en|en|wav/p237_037.wav|||It was clear.|
003752|237-en|en|wav/p237_038.wav|||It is not for any other purpose.|
003753|237-en|en|wav/p237_039.wav|||The problem is the pitch.|
003754|237-en|en|wav/p237_040.wav|||It's a great thing.|
003755|237-en|en|wav/p237_041.wav|||He did not know his daughter.|
003756|237-en|en|wav/p237_042.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
003757|237-en|en|wav/p237_043.wav|||That is a break with tradition.|
003758|237-en|en|wav/p237_044.wav|||It's the only thing.|
003759|237-en|en|wav/p237_045.wav|||It is so sad.|
003760|237-en|en|wav/p237_046.wav|||There will be no shortage of quality applicants.|
003761|237-en|en|wav/p237_047.wav|||It is urgent.|
003762|237-en|en|wav/p237_048.wav|||I feel pretty good.|
003763|237-en|en|wav/p237_049.wav|||We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.|
003764|237-en|en|wav/p237_050.wav|||It is bizarre.|
003765|237-en|en|wav/p237_051.wav|||That should do it.|
003766|237-en|en|wav/p237_052.wav|||The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.|
003767|237-en|en|wav/p237_053.wav|||She looked so young.|
003768|237-en|en|wav/p237_054.wav|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|
003769|237-en|en|wav/p237_055.wav|||Life is good.|
003770|237-en|en|wav/p237_056.wav|||No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.|
003771|237-en|en|wav/p237_057.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
003772|237-en|en|wav/p237_058.wav|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
003773|237-en|en|wav/p237_059.wav|||We were surprised to see the photograph.|
003774|237-en|en|wav/p237_060.wav|||New York is expected to come to a standstill.|
003775|237-en|en|wav/p237_061.wav|||I've had six days of rehearsal.|
003776|237-en|en|wav/p237_062.wav|||None has ever been found.|
003777|237-en|en|wav/p237_063.wav|||It's a real challenge.|

003782|237-en|en|wav/p237_068.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
003783|237-en|en|wav/p237_069.wav|||It is like a river running by my home.|
003784|237-en|en|wav/p237_070.wav|||We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.|
003785|237-en|en|wav/p237_071.wav|||Try to save us.|
003786|237-en|en|wav/p237_072.wav|||The end result is precisely the same.|
003787|237-en|en|wav/p237_073.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
003788|237-en|en|wav/p237_074.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
003789|237-en|en|wav/p237_075.wav|||I was just trying to win the golf tournament.|
003790|237-en|en|wav/p237_076.wav|||The price cuts are really exciting.|
003791|237-en|en|wav/p237_077.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|

003794|237-en|en|wav/p237_080.wav|||It may well have been.|

003800|237-en|en|wav/p237_086.wav|||It's never too late.|
003801|237-en|en|wav/p237_087.wav|||Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|

004061|238-en|en|wav/p238_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
004062|238-en|en|wav/p238_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

004064|238-en|en|wav/p238_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
004065|238-en|en|wav/p238_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

004074|238-en|en|wav/p238_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
004075|238-en|en|wav/p238_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

005018|240-en|en|wav/p240_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
005019|240-en|en|wav/p240_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

005029|240-en|en|wav/p240_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

005032|240-en|en|wav/p240_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

005034|240-en|en|wav/p240_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

005257|240-en|en|wav/p240_246.wav|||It is hard won.|
005258|240-en|en|wav/p240_247.wav|||A change in that position would require a decision by the council.|

005297|240-en|en|wav/p240_286.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
005298|240-en|en|wav/p240_288.wav|||His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.|
005299|240-en|en|wav/p240_289.wav|||Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.|

005361|240-en|en|wav/p240_352.wav|||That is the very reason why it was so vital.|
005362|240-en|en|wav/p240_353.wav|||However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.|
005363|240-en|en|wav/p240_354.wav|||The composer will conduct.|

005376|240-en|en|wav/p240_368.wav|||But the real problem is the closure of the export market.|
005377|240-en|en|wav/p240_369.wav|||Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|
005378|240-en|en|wav/p240_370.wav|||Hartley should know.|

005395|241-en|en|wav/p241_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
005396|241-en|en|wav/p241_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

005405|241-en|en|wav/p241_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
005406|241-en|en|wav/p241_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
005407|241-en|en|wav/p241_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
005408|241-en|en|wav/p241_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

006054|243-en|en|wav/p243_317.wav|||He will just go on doing his job.|
006055|243-en|en|wav/p243_318.wav|||I always felt they played for me.|
006056|243-en|en|wav/p243_319.wav|||That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.|
006057|243-en|en|wav/p243_320.wav|||The team spirit that was here last year is again good.|
006058|243-en|en|wav/p243_321.wav|||This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.|
006059|243-en|en|wav/p243_322.wav|||We will not simply hit these people.|
006060|243-en|en|wav/p243_323.wav|||We still think this trade is on the increase.|
006061|243-en|en|wav/p243_324.wav|||It is not either national standards or local control.|
006062|243-en|en|wav/p243_325.wav|||His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.|
006063|243-en|en|wav/p243_326.wav|||I feel as if I can hole everything now.|
006064|243-en|en|wav/p243_327.wav|||I try to be open to experience.|
006065|243-en|en|wav/p243_328.wav|||He is not exactly a pretty child.|
006066|243-en|en|wav/p243_329.wav|||I thought the race was a little bit slow.|
006067|243-en|en|wav/p243_330.wav|||If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.|
006068|243-en|en|wav/p243_331.wav|||Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.|
006069|243-en|en|wav/p243_332.wav|||I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.|
006070|243-en|en|wav/p243_333.wav|||These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.|
006071|243-en|en|wav/p243_334.wav|||One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.|
006072|243-en|en|wav/p243_335.wav|||Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.|
006073|243-en|en|wav/p243_336.wav|||I hope numbers will be up on last time.|
006074|243-en|en|wav/p243_337.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
006075|243-en|en|wav/p243_338.wav|||How are you, sir ?|
006076|243-en|en|wav/p243_339.wav|||So is that it, then ?|
006077|243-en|en|wav/p243_340.wav|||Do I have a favourite ?|
006078|243-en|en|wav/p243_341.wav|||Put another way, they just won't do it.|
006079|243-en|en|wav/p243_342.wav|||Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.|
006080|243-en|en|wav/p243_343.wav|||Getting that balance right can be very difficult.|
006081|243-en|en|wav/p243_344.wav|||Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.|
006082|243-en|en|wav/p243_345.wav|||Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.|
006083|243-en|en|wav/p243_346.wav|||It was a bit like having children.|
006084|243-en|en|wav/p243_347.wav|||And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.|
006085|243-en|en|wav/p243_348.wav|||And that is the bottom line - box office.|
006086|243-en|en|wav/p243_349.wav|||I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.|
006087|243-en|en|wav/p243_350.wav|||I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.|
006088|243-en|en|wav/p243_352.wav|||Sales will begin by the end of October.|
006089|243-en|en|wav/p243_353.wav|||The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.|
006090|243-en|en|wav/p243_354.wav|||Friday night was a pretty good night.|
006091|243-en|en|wav/p243_355.wav|||It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.|
006092|243-en|en|wav/p243_356.wav|||The deal is expected to be completed by September.|
006093|243-en|en|wav/p243_357.wav|||It is the only natural British site on the list.|
006094|243-en|en|wav/p243_358.wav|||His style was direct and very human.|
006095|243-en|en|wav/p243_359.wav|||Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.|
006096|243-en|en|wav/p243_360.wav|||They have the cash and the fire power.|
006097|243-en|en|wav/p243_361.wav|||The institute board will take the decision.|
006098|243-en|en|wav/p243_362.wav|||He's young enough and he must learn.|
006099|243-en|en|wav/p243_363.wav|||Such a policy is for long-term strength.|
006100|243-en|en|wav/p243_364.wav|||Both players gave so much to the side.|
006101|243-en|en|wav/p243_365.wav|||Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.|

006103|243-en|en|wav/p243_367.wav|||The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.|
006104|243-en|en|wav/p243_368.wav|||It was a goal which came from nothing.|
006105|243-en|en|wav/p243_369.wav|||We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.|
006106|243-en|en|wav/p243_370.wav|||I have come here to show support for the families.|
006107|243-en|en|wav/p243_371.wav|||We have been going for three years.|
006108|243-en|en|wav/p243_372.wav|||He really played us into a corner.|
006109|243-en|en|wav/p243_373.wav|||They know the truth, they really know the truth.|
006110|243-en|en|wav/p243_374.wav|||It was another black day for Ayrshire.|
006111|243-en|en|wav/p243_375.wav|||Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.|
006112|243-en|en|wav/p243_376.wav|||It used to be all hard sell.|
006113|243-en|en|wav/p243_377.wav|||The direct effects on trade will be limited.|
006114|243-en|en|wav/p243_378.wav|||He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.|
006115|243-en|en|wav/p243_379.wav|||He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.|
006116|243-en|en|wav/p243_380.wav|||This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.|
006117|243-en|en|wav/p243_381.wav|||This is not a small amount of money.|
006118|243-en|en|wav/p243_382.wav|||The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.|
006119|243-en|en|wav/p243_383.wav|||I just felt that I was broken down.|
006120|243-en|en|wav/p243_384.wav|||What do we do ?|
006121|243-en|en|wav/p243_385.wav|||Why do it otherwise ?|
006122|243-en|en|wav/p243_386.wav|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
006123|243-en|en|wav/p243_387.wav|||The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.|
006124|243-en|en|wav/p243_388.wav|||Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.|
006125|243-en|en|wav/p243_389.wav|||He remains a main board director of Royal.|
006126|243-en|en|wav/p243_390.wav|||His record on Government has always been highly effective.|
006127|243-en|en|wav/p243_391.wav|||My tax affairs have been totally open.|
006128|243-en|en|wav/p243_392.wav|||Five years ago its return was rejected.|
006129|243-en|en|wav/p243_393.wav|||But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.|
006130|243-en|en|wav/p243_394.wav|||In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.|
006131|243-en|en|wav/p243_395.wav|||In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.|
006132|243-en|en|wav/p243_396.wav|||We are keen to see truth and justice.|
006133|243-en|en|wav/p243_397.wav|||The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|
006134|243-en|en|wav/p243_398.wav|||People have a wish to charge twice.|
006135|244-en|en|wav/p244_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
006136|244-en|en|wav/p244_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
006137|244-en|en|wav/p244_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
006138|244-en|en|wav/p244_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
006139|244-en|en|wav/p244_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
006140|244-en|en|wav/p244_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
006141|244-en|en|wav/p244_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
006142|244-en|en|wav/p244_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
006143|244-en|en|wav/p244_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
006144|244-en|en|wav/p244_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
006145|244-en|en|wav/p244_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
006146|244-en|en|wav/p244_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
006147|244-en|en|wav/p244_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
006148|244-en|en|wav/p244_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
006149|244-en|en|wav/p244_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
006150|244-en|en|wav/p244_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
006151|244-en|en|wav/p244_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
006152|244-en|en|wav/p244_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
006153|244-en|en|wav/p244_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
006154|244-en|en|wav/p244_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
006155|244-en|en|wav/p244_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
006156|244-en|en|wav/p244_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
006157|244-en|en|wav/p244_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
006158|244-en|en|wav/p244_025.wav|||We are a service industry.|
006159|244-en|en|wav/p244_026.wav|||It may be good for the soul.|
006160|244-en|en|wav/p244_027.wav|||We want to lift the cup for the fans.|
006161|244-en|en|wav/p244_028.wav|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
006162|244-en|en|wav/p244_029.wav|||It is about investing in the future.|
006163|244-en|en|wav/p244_030.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
006164|244-en|en|wav/p244_031.wav|||They were in good humour, too.|
006165|244-en|en|wav/p244_032.wav|||The end result is the same.|
006166|244-en|en|wav/p244_033.wav|||It is on the internet.|
006167|244-en|en|wav/p244_034.wav|||These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|
006168|244-en|en|wav/p244_035.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
006169|244-en|en|wav/p244_036.wav|||This is a central issue.|
006170|244-en|en|wav/p244_037.wav|||History is in the making.|
006171|244-en|en|wav/p244_038.wav|||Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|
006172|244-en|en|wav/p244_039.wav|||She was there for the start of the campaign.|
006173|244-en|en|wav/p244_040.wav|||She was at the top.|
006174|244-en|en|wav/p244_041.wav|||In London today, it was business as usual.|
006175|244-en|en|wav/p244_042.wav|||And they had a case.|
006176|244-en|en|wav/p244_043.wav|||Something has to be put in place.|
006177|244-en|en|wav/p244_044.wav|||If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|
006178|244-en|en|wav/p244_045.wav|||They are going after them.|
006179|244-en|en|wav/p244_046.wav|||It is all about the story.|
006180|244-en|en|wav/p244_047.wav|||The whole thing is the music.|
006181|244-en|en|wav/p244_048.wav|||In fact, they are the future of investment.|
006182|244-en|en|wav/p244_049.wav|||That is still the case.|
006183|244-en|en|wav/p244_050.wav|||At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|
006184|244-en|en|wav/p244_051.wav|||In my view, it has to be done.|
006185|244-en|en|wav/p244_052.wav|||The pressure on the players will build.|
006186|244-en|en|wav/p244_053.wav|||Their campaign is in disarray.|
006187|244-en|en|wav/p244_054.wav|||But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|
006188|244-en|en|wav/p244_055.wav|||Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|
006189|244-en|en|wav/p244_056.wav|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|
006190|244-en|en|wav/p244_057.wav|||Clearly, they had other problems.|
006191|244-en|en|wav/p244_058.wav|||This trend is likely to strengthen.|
006192|244-en|en|wav/p244_059.wav|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
006193|244-en|en|wav/p244_060.wav|||We have got to deliver.|
006194|244-en|en|wav/p244_061.wav|||That was the difference today.|
006195|244-en|en|wav/p244_062.wav|||The company continues to grow.|
006196|244-en|en|wav/p244_063.wav|||He said it was for sale.|
006197|244-en|en|wav/p244_064.wav|||We felt it was sufficient.|
006198|244-en|en|wav/p244_065.wav|||That is all in the past.|
006199|244-en|en|wav/p244_066.wav|||There is a lot to be done.|
006200|244-en|en|wav/p244_067.wav|||But that's another story for another day.|
006201|244-en|en|wav/p244_068.wav|||He has not been dropped.|
006202|244-en|en|wav/p244_069.wav|||It was an outstanding performance.|
006203|244-en|en|wav/p244_070.wav|||I can't remember a lot about the accident.|
006204|244-en|en|wav/p244_071.wav|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
006205|244-en|en|wav/p244_072.wav|||It is only the beginning.|
006206|244-en|en|wav/p244_073.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
006207|244-en|en|wav/p244_074.wav|||Only water is currently allowed.|
006208|244-en|en|wav/p244_075.wav|||This time, it might be for real.|
006209|244-en|en|wav/p244_076.wav|||She did that for the rest of her life.|
006210|244-en|en|wav/p244_077.wav|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
006211|244-en|en|wav/p244_078.wav|||That will be the office.|
006212|244-en|en|wav/p244_079.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
006213|244-en|en|wav/p244_080.wav|||How are you, sir ?|
006214|244-en|en|wav/p244_081.wav|||So is that it, then ?|
006215|244-en|en|wav/p244_082.wav|||Do I have a favourite ?|
006216|244-en|en|wav/p244_083.wav|||What do we do ?|
006217|244-en|en|wav/p244_084.wav|||Why do it otherwise ?|
006218|244-en|en|wav/p244_085.wav|||It starts with the script.|
006219|244-en|en|wav/p244_086.wav|||Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|
006220|244-en|en|wav/p244_087.wav|||It would have been around the turn of the century.|
006221|244-en|en|wav/p244_088.wav|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
006222|244-en|en|wav/p244_089.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
006223|244-en|en|wav/p244_090.wav|||It seems a good thing to try.|
006224|244-en|en|wav/p244_091.wav|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
006225|244-en|en|wav/p244_092.wav|||It sounds a lot of money.|
006226|244-en|en|wav/p244_093.wav|||However, a ruling will not come before next week.|
006227|244-en|en|wav/p244_094.wav|||It is not a story.|
006228|244-en|en|wav/p244_095.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
006229|244-en|en|wav/p244_096.wav|||He is in the US.|
006230|244-en|en|wav/p244_097.wav|||I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|
006231|244-en|en|wav/p244_098.wav|||It took an option on the process.|
006232|244-en|en|wav/p244_099.wav|||By then, he was walking on water.|
006233|244-en|en|wav/p244_100.wav|||This is a game of confidence.|
006234|244-en|en|wav/p244_101.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
006235|244-en|en|wav/p244_102.wav|||He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|
006236|244-en|en|wav/p244_103.wav|||The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.|
006237|244-en|en|wav/p244_104.wav|||The trick is to try it.|
006238|244-en|en|wav/p244_105.wav|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
006239|244-en|en|wav/p244_106.wav|||Victory was never in doubt.|
006240|244-en|en|wav/p244_107.wav|||This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|
006241|244-en|en|wav/p244_108.wav|||On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.|
006242|244-en|en|wav/p244_109.wav|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
006243|244-en|en|wav/p244_110.wav|||Then again, we could have.|
006244|244-en|en|wav/p244_111.wav|||There, you were just a body.|
006245|244-en|en|wav/p244_112.wav|||But he has not become a monster.|
006246|244-en|en|wav/p244_113.wav|||He is not a dancer.|
006247|244-en|en|wav/p244_114.wav|||We had planned to sell the property for some time.|
006248|244-en|en|wav/p244_115.wav|||A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|
006249|244-en|en|wav/p244_116.wav|||In the end we have to take a stand.|
006250|244-en|en|wav/p244_117.wav|||This is a sea change in approach.|
006251|244-en|en|wav/p244_118.wav|||Otherwise, the market may come back.|
006252|244-en|en|wav/p244_119.wav|||The procedures were not in place.|
006253|244-en|en|wav/p244_120.wav|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
006254|244-en|en|wav/p244_121.wav|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
006255|244-en|en|wav/p244_122.wav|||He was not alone at the top of the board.|
006256|244-en|en|wav/p244_123.wav|||The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|
006257|244-en|en|wav/p244_124.wav|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
006258|244-en|en|wav/p244_125.wav|||We had a great time.|
006259|244-en|en|wav/p244_126.wav|||I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.|
006260|244-en|en|wav/p244_127.wav|||According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|
006261|244-en|en|wav/p244_128.wav|||It was far from business as usual.|
006262|244-en|en|wav/p244_129.wav|||He wanted to record the group.|
006263|244-en|en|wav/p244_130.wav|||He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|
006264|244-en|en|wav/p244_131.wav|||Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|
006265|244-en|en|wav/p244_132.wav|||It is hard to believe.|
006266|244-en|en|wav/p244_133.wav|||Or it would have been.|
006267|244-en|en|wav/p244_134.wav|||Three days later, he was killed.|
006268|244-en|en|wav/p244_135.wav|||Football is a passion for many.|
006269|244-en|en|wav/p244_136.wav|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
006270|244-en|en|wav/p244_137.wav|||So, did she meet him ?|
006271|244-en|en|wav/p244_138.wav|||So what is the campaign about ?|
006272|244-en|en|wav/p244_139.wav|||And does it ?|
006273|244-en|en|wav/p244_140.wav|||Are you from the rugby ?|
006274|244-en|en|wav/p244_141.wav|||However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|
006275|244-en|en|wav/p244_142.wav|||That was the first step.|
006276|244-en|en|wav/p244_143.wav|||However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|
006277|244-en|en|wav/p244_144.wav|||I have been in contact with him.|
006278|244-en|en|wav/p244_145.wav|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
006279|244-en|en|wav/p244_146.wav|||When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|
006280|244-en|en|wav/p244_147.wav|||They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|
006281|244-en|en|wav/p244_148.wav|||I am the manager of Scotland.|
006282|244-en|en|wav/p244_149.wav|||There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|
006283|244-en|en|wav/p244_150.wav|||There were no grounds for his action.|
006284|244-en|en|wav/p244_151.wav|||I can't even get into the A team.|
006285|244-en|en|wav/p244_152.wav|||It starts at the top.|
006286|244-en|en|wav/p244_153.wav|||Others are expected to follow the lead.|
006287|244-en|en|wav/p244_154.wav|||She does not want to speak.|
006288|244-en|en|wav/p244_155.wav|||It was all for good reason as well.|
006289|244-en|en|wav/p244_156.wav|||One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|
006290|244-en|en|wav/p244_157.wav|||It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|
006291|244-en|en|wav/p244_158.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
006292|244-en|en|wav/p244_159.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
006293|244-en|en|wav/p244_160.wav|||We want to get there.|
006294|244-en|en|wav/p244_161.wav|||On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|
006295|244-en|en|wav/p244_162.wav|||There is a lack of staff.|
006296|244-en|en|wav/p244_163.wav|||Not that the occasion was without restraint.|
006297|244-en|en|wav/p244_164.wav|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|
006298|244-en|en|wav/p244_165.wav|||This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|
006299|244-en|en|wav/p244_166.wav|||At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.|
006300|244-en|en|wav/p244_167.wav|||Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|
006301|244-en|en|wav/p244_168.wav|||Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|
006302|244-en|en|wav/p244_169.wav|||Anyone can do the sums.|
006303|244-en|en|wav/p244_170.wav|||We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.|
006304|244-en|en|wav/p244_171.wav|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
006305|244-en|en|wav/p244_172.wav|||Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|
006306|244-en|en|wav/p244_173.wav|||We were all over the place in the first half.|
006307|244-en|en|wav/p244_174.wav|||Like the others, he was arrested.|
006308|244-en|en|wav/p244_175.wav|||All the pressure was on him.|
006309|244-en|en|wav/p244_176.wav|||Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|
006310|244-en|en|wav/p244_177.wav|||They have not been named.|
006311|244-en|en|wav/p244_178.wav|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
006312|244-en|en|wav/p244_179.wav|||I think the Labour party is completely split on this.|
006313|244-en|en|wav/p244_180.wav|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
006314|244-en|en|wav/p244_181.wav|||I was always in control.|
006315|244-en|en|wav/p244_182.wav|||It was by the numbers.|
006316|244-en|en|wav/p244_183.wav|||I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.|
006317|244-en|en|wav/p244_184.wav|||It should never have happened.|
006318|244-en|en|wav/p244_185.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
006319|244-en|en|wav/p244_186.wav|||The feeling is hard to describe.|
006320|244-en|en|wav/p244_187.wav|||It is difficult to say.|
006321|244-en|en|wav/p244_188.wav|||That is a question for the next manager.|
006322|244-en|en|wav/p244_189.wav|||By then, however, both men were already in the US.|
006323|244-en|en|wav/p244_190.wav|||However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|
006324|244-en|en|wav/p244_191.wav|||It is simply not true.|
006325|244-en|en|wav/p244_192.wav|||Are you going to win ?|
006326|244-en|en|wav/p244_193.wav|||Was it the wife ?|
006327|244-en|en|wav/p244_194.wav|||Why change it ?|
006328|244-en|en|wav/p244_195.wav|||What do we want to do that for ?|
006329|244-en|en|wav/p244_196.wav|||Does the name matter ?|
006330|244-en|en|wav/p244_197.wav|||That you can do it.|
006331|244-en|en|wav/p244_198.wav|||I would like to continue to develop.|
006332|244-en|en|wav/p244_199.wav|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
006333|244-en|en|wav/p244_200.wav|||He has defended the system.|
006334|244-en|en|wav/p244_201.wav|||We want to begin a programme in the UK.|
006335|244-en|en|wav/p244_203.wav|||At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|
006336|244-en|en|wav/p244_204.wav|||It is not an issue.|
006337|244-en|en|wav/p244_205.wav|||They have to get that sorted.|
006338|244-en|en|wav/p244_206.wav|||We can take the city.|
006339|244-en|en|wav/p244_207.wav|||He played it like a veteran.|
006340|244-en|en|wav/p244_208.wav|||It was the story of the second half.|
006341|244-en|en|wav/p244_209.wav|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
006342|244-en|en|wav/p244_210.wav|||As many as the market will support.|
006343|244-en|en|wav/p244_211.wav|||He is believed to live in Britain.|
006344|244-en|en|wav/p244_212.wav|||Hopefully, it will bring new customers.|
006345|244-en|en|wav/p244_213.wav|||The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.|
006346|244-en|en|wav/p244_214.wav|||This conference was never confirmed.|
006347|244-en|en|wav/p244_215.wav|||A team is a team.|
006348|244-en|en|wav/p244_216.wav|||However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|
006349|244-en|en|wav/p244_217.wav|||I'm interested in interesting work.|
006350|244-en|en|wav/p244_218.wav|||It decided to blame the media.|
006351|244-en|en|wav/p244_219.wav|||THE force is with them.|
006352|244-en|en|wav/p244_220.wav|||This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|
006353|244-en|en|wav/p244_221.wav|||It was important to win today.|
006354|244-en|en|wav/p244_222.wav|||He was not injured in the attack.|
006355|244-en|en|wav/p244_223.wav|||Because he was born in England.|
006356|244-en|en|wav/p244_224.wav|||Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|
006357|244-en|en|wav/p244_225.wav|||Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.|
006358|244-en|en|wav/p244_226.wav|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
006359|244-en|en|wav/p244_227.wav|||However, it is not as simple as this.|
006360|244-en|en|wav/p244_228.wav|||We want this place to work.|
006361|244-en|en|wav/p244_229.wav|||It still has an effect.|
006362|244-en|en|wav/p244_230.wav|||The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|
006363|244-en|en|wav/p244_231.wav|||I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|
006364|244-en|en|wav/p244_232.wav|||Other villages were completely deserted.|
006365|244-en|en|wav/p244_233.wav|||There is a lot of concern.|
006366|244-en|en|wav/p244_234.wav|||It will be decided in the next month.|
006367|244-en|en|wav/p244_235.wav|||We have to win the group.|
006368|244-en|en|wav/p244_236.wav|||It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|
006369|244-en|en|wav/p244_237.wav|||We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|
006370|244-en|en|wav/p244_238.wav|||We have an election in eight days.|
006371|244-en|en|wav/p244_239.wav|||There was a lot of resentment.|
006372|244-en|en|wav/p244_240.wav|||This is a fight to the death.|
006373|244-en|en|wav/p244_241.wav|||All will be revealed in due course.|
006374|244-en|en|wav/p244_242.wav|||He is a man of the people.|
006375|244-en|en|wav/p244_243.wav|||The matter is under appeal.|
006376|244-en|en|wav/p244_244.wav|||And they were being paid ?|
006377|244-en|en|wav/p244_245.wav|||was everything done to save people ?|
006378|244-en|en|wav/p244_246.wav|||What was the matter for concern ?|
006379|244-en|en|wav/p244_247.wav|||Do I think about them often ?|
006380|244-en|en|wav/p244_248.wav|||Is it in the right place ?|
006381|244-en|en|wav/p244_249.wav|||Did he trip ?|
006382|244-en|en|wav/p244_250.wav|||Sadly, it could not be done.|
006383|244-en|en|wav/p244_251.wav|||I wouldn't even respond to that question.|
006384|244-en|en|wav/p244_252.wav|||Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|
006385|244-en|en|wav/p244_253.wav|||Instead, he missed the lot.|
006386|244-en|en|wav/p244_254.wav|||I was never in danger.|
006387|244-en|en|wav/p244_255.wav|||A lot has been written.|
006388|244-en|en|wav/p244_256.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
006389|244-en|en|wav/p244_257.wav|||It was really good in the first week.|
006390|244-en|en|wav/p244_258.wav|||If it doesn't, it doesn't.|
006391|244-en|en|wav/p244_259.wav|||However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.|
006392|244-en|en|wav/p244_260.wav|||That is not the case in Europe.|
006393|244-en|en|wav/p244_261.wav|||But it was a loss.|
006394|244-en|en|wav/p244_262.wav|||So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|
006395|244-en|en|wav/p244_263.wav|||The performance continues to improve.|
006396|244-en|en|wav/p244_264.wav|||It expected this trend to continue.|
006397|244-en|en|wav/p244_265.wav|||However, no further action was taken by police.|
006398|244-en|en|wav/p244_266.wav|||It depends on Labour, not on us.|
006399|244-en|en|wav/p244_267.wav|||But we were in control at that point.|
006400|244-en|en|wav/p244_268.wav|||It has to be enforced.|
006401|244-en|en|wav/p244_269.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
006402|244-en|en|wav/p244_270.wav|||Moreover, it must be for all sports.|
006403|244-en|en|wav/p244_271.wav|||But the government has so far failed to listen.|
006404|244-en|en|wav/p244_272.wav|||He must have a crack at it.|
006405|244-en|en|wav/p244_273.wav|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
006406|244-en|en|wav/p244_274.wav|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
006407|244-en|en|wav/p244_275.wav|||He was good, but not that good.|
006408|244-en|en|wav/p244_276.wav|||The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|
006409|244-en|en|wav/p244_277.wav|||Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|
006410|244-en|en|wav/p244_278.wav|||However, the matter is not going to end there.|
006411|244-en|en|wav/p244_279.wav|||It might be sad, but it's a fact.|
006412|244-en|en|wav/p244_280.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
006413|244-en|en|wav/p244_281.wav|||Obviously, we would want to look at this.|
006414|244-en|en|wav/p244_282.wav|||On a practical level, it would be difficult.|
006415|244-en|en|wav/p244_283.wav|||If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|
006416|244-en|en|wav/p244_284.wav|||It is important that he is involved.|
006417|244-en|en|wav/p244_285.wav|||If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|
006418|244-en|en|wav/p244_286.wav|||It should be noted that he has been released without charge.|
006419|244-en|en|wav/p244_287.wav|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
006420|244-en|en|wav/p244_288.wav|||Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|
006421|244-en|en|wav/p244_290.wav|||I should think so, too.|
006422|244-en|en|wav/p244_291.wav|||None of the agencies was able to help.|
006423|244-en|en|wav/p244_292.wav|||I didn't see the point.|
006424|244-en|en|wav/p244_293.wav|||This idea has been around for four years.|
006425|244-en|en|wav/p244_294.wav|||We are in a war.|
006426|244-en|en|wav/p244_295.wav|||Do you think we are a top nation ?|
006427|244-en|en|wav/p244_296.wav|||Is our children learning ?|
006428|244-en|en|wav/p244_297.wav|||How independent is that ?|
006429|244-en|en|wav/p244_298.wav|||What form did that take ?|
006430|244-en|en|wav/p244_299.wav|||Are they free ?|
006431|244-en|en|wav/p244_300.wav|||Scotland won by six wickets.|
006432|244-en|en|wav/p244_301.wav|||However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|
006433|244-en|en|wav/p244_302.wav|||This is a historic agreement.|
006434|244-en|en|wav/p244_303.wav|||We have to be realistic.|
006435|244-en|en|wav/p244_304.wav|||Every one is a winner.|
006436|244-en|en|wav/p244_305.wav|||There was a hole in it.|
006437|244-en|en|wav/p244_306.wav|||It will be done in stages.|
006438|244-en|en|wav/p244_307.wav|||It all started with a visiting rugby club.|
006439|244-en|en|wav/p244_308.wav|||Every character was completely different.|
006440|244-en|en|wav/p244_309.wav|||But it is a similar problem.|
006441|244-en|en|wav/p244_310.wav|||In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.|
006442|244-en|en|wav/p244_311.wav|||But it is important for a number of reasons.|
006443|244-en|en|wav/p244_312.wav|||In that moment, I was happy.|
006444|244-en|en|wav/p244_313.wav|||All of the management has invested in the firm.|
006445|244-en|en|wav/p244_314.wav|||It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|
006446|244-en|en|wav/p244_315.wav|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
006447|244-en|en|wav/p244_316.wav|||It involved the same people.|
006448|244-en|en|wav/p244_317.wav|||We want to get back into the Champions League.|
006449|244-en|en|wav/p244_318.wav|||We have to be very, very careful.|
006450|244-en|en|wav/p244_319.wav|||Look at the potential of this club.|
006451|244-en|en|wav/p244_320.wav|||Hopefully, this week will be good.|
006452|244-en|en|wav/p244_321.wav|||This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|
006453|244-en|en|wav/p244_322.wav|||We did something about it.|
006454|244-en|en|wav/p244_323.wav|||But it is up again.|
006455|244-en|en|wav/p244_324.wav|||However, the devil is in the detail.|
006456|244-en|en|wav/p244_325.wav|||For the moment, however, the position is clear.|
006457|244-en|en|wav/p244_326.wav|||The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|
006458|244-en|en|wav/p244_327.wav|||He is already in place.|
006459|244-en|en|wav/p244_328.wav|||Another difference is the cost.|
006460|244-en|en|wav/p244_329.wav|||Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|
006461|244-en|en|wav/p244_330.wav|||And we can do it.|
006462|244-en|en|wav/p244_331.wav|||What are they for ?|
006463|244-en|en|wav/p244_333.wav|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
006464|244-en|en|wav/p244_334.wav|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
006465|244-en|en|wav/p244_335.wav|||And it's a goodbye from him.|
006466|244-en|en|wav/p244_336.wav|||It is a sensitive issue.|
006467|244-en|en|wav/p244_337.wav|||They have to be addressed.|
006468|244-en|en|wav/p244_338.wav|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
006469|244-en|en|wav/p244_339.wav|||Like many companies, it is a problem.|
006470|244-en|en|wav/p244_340.wav|||The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.|
006471|244-en|en|wav/p244_341.wav|||However, a bid was never made.|
006472|244-en|en|wav/p244_342.wav|||That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|
006473|244-en|en|wav/p244_343.wav|||Something is going to have to give.|
006474|244-en|en|wav/p244_344.wav|||And the context is also completely different.|
006475|244-en|en|wav/p244_345.wav|||The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|
006476|244-en|en|wav/p244_346.wav|||The banking sector was weak.|
006477|244-en|en|wav/p244_347.wav|||But the New Year was special.|
006478|244-en|en|wav/p244_348.wav|||We never played at all.|
006479|244-en|en|wav/p244_349.wav|||However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|
006480|244-en|en|wav/p244_350.wav|||This isn't the end of story.|
006481|244-en|en|wav/p244_351.wav|||He is a great prospect.|
006482|244-en|en|wav/p244_352.wav|||He has been told by the doctor to rest.|
006483|244-en|en|wav/p244_353.wav|||However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|
006484|244-en|en|wav/p244_354.wav|||Of course, it does not have to be this way.|
006485|244-en|en|wav/p244_355.wav|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
006486|244-en|en|wav/p244_356.wav|||However, it does not tell the full story.|
006487|244-en|en|wav/p244_357.wav|||They were impressive against France.|
006488|244-en|en|wav/p244_358.wav|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
006489|244-en|en|wav/p244_359.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
006490|244-en|en|wav/p244_360.wav|||It was a test in itself.|
006491|244-en|en|wav/p244_361.wav|||Either team will be hard.|
006492|244-en|en|wav/p244_362.wav|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
006493|244-en|en|wav/p244_363.wav|||At first, the youngster was not keen.|
006494|244-en|en|wav/p244_364.wav|||However, it has to be seen as part of a package.|
006495|244-en|en|wav/p244_365.wav|||On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|
006496|244-en|en|wav/p244_366.wav|||In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|
006497|244-en|en|wav/p244_367.wav|||Lately, that market has come under pressure.|
006498|244-en|en|wav/p244_368.wav|||In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|
006499|244-en|en|wav/p244_369.wav|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
006500|244-en|en|wav/p244_370.wav|||The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|
006501|244-en|en|wav/p244_371.wav|||I have a good feeling about this.|
006502|244-en|en|wav/p244_372.wav|||The news is not all bad.|
006503|244-en|en|wav/p244_373.wav|||Some of the passing was a disgrace.|
006504|244-en|en|wav/p244_374.wav|||However, it does not seem to be the case.|
006505|244-en|en|wav/p244_375.wav|||It is almost certain to be the last.|
006506|244-en|en|wav/p244_376.wav|||You have to be patient.|
006507|244-en|en|wav/p244_377.wav|||However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|
006508|244-en|en|wav/p244_378.wav|||I was delighted to accept.|
006509|244-en|en|wav/p244_379.wav|||A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|
006510|244-en|en|wav/p244_380.wav|||We are not going to fight in Kosovo.|
006511|244-en|en|wav/p244_381.wav|||Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|
006512|244-en|en|wav/p244_382.wav|||It's fantastic to win again.|
006513|244-en|en|wav/p244_383.wav|||For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.|
006514|244-en|en|wav/p244_384.wav|||The company won the first round but lost on appeal.|
006515|244-en|en|wav/p244_385.wav|||Everything is in the mix.|
006516|244-en|en|wav/p244_386.wav|||An announcement is expected this week.|
006517|244-en|en|wav/p244_387.wav|||He will be difficult to replace.|
006518|244-en|en|wav/p244_388.wav|||I would be interested in another attempt.|
006519|244-en|en|wav/p244_389.wav|||In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|
006520|244-en|en|wav/p244_390.wav|||He was on a mission.|
006521|244-en|en|wav/p244_391.wav|||Does it matter ?|
006522|244-en|en|wav/p244_392.wav|||How do you take them away ?|
006523|244-en|en|wav/p244_393.wav|||However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|
006524|244-en|en|wav/p244_394.wav|||After the match, do you ?|
006525|244-en|en|wav/p244_395.wav|||One-third of the places are already taken.|
006526|244-en|en|wav/p244_396.wav|||I understand the frustration of the fans.|
006527|244-en|en|wav/p244_397.wav|||Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|
006528|244-en|en|wav/p244_398.wav|||On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|
006529|244-en|en|wav/p244_399.wav|||I want this one to be different.|
006530|244-en|en|wav/p244_400.wav|||It is the last meeting of the season.|
006531|244-en|en|wav/p244_401.wav|||Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.|
006532|244-en|en|wav/p244_402.wav|||We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.|
006533|244-en|en|wav/p244_403.wav|||He is a quality player.|
006534|244-en|en|wav/p244_404.wav|||The service is expected to be introduced in December.|
006535|244-en|en|wav/p244_405.wav|||It's all been about the basics of the business.|
006536|244-en|en|wav/p244_406.wav|||There is a demand for it.|
006537|244-en|en|wav/p244_407.wav|||It's great that it happened in Britain.|
006538|244-en|en|wav/p244_408.wav|||I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|
006539|244-en|en|wav/p244_409.wav|||They are not going the length of the pitch.|
006540|244-en|en|wav/p244_410.wav|||Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|
006541|244-en|en|wav/p244_411.wav|||However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|
006542|244-en|en|wav/p244_412.wav|||Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.|
006543|244-en|en|wav/p244_413.wav|||Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|
006544|244-en|en|wav/p244_414.wav|||In order to get there, we have got to invest.|
006545|244-en|en|wav/p244_415.wav|||Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|
006546|244-en|en|wav/p244_416.wav|||There is no need to panic.|
006547|244-en|en|wav/p244_417.wav|||It had been on the cards.|
006548|244-en|en|wav/p244_418.wav|||However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.|
006549|244-en|en|wav/p244_419.wav|||Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|
006550|244-en|en|wav/p244_420.wav|||That might mean another delay.|
006551|244-en|en|wav/p244_421.wav|||One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|
006552|244-en|en|wav/p244_422.wav|||I am delighted for them.|
006553|244-en|en|wav/p244_423.wav|||He's had to suffer for the last six years.|
006554|244-en|en|wav/p244_424.wav|||But it was a struggle.|
006555|245-en|en|wav/p245_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
006556|245-en|en|wav/p245_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
006557|245-en|en|wav/p245_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
006558|245-en|en|wav/p245_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
006559|245-en|en|wav/p245_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
006560|245-en|en|wav/p245_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
006561|245-en|en|wav/p245_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
006562|245-en|en|wav/p245_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
006563|245-en|en|wav/p245_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
006564|245-en|en|wav/p245_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
006565|245-en|en|wav/p245_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
006566|245-en|en|wav/p245_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
006567|245-en|en|wav/p245_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
006568|245-en|en|wav/p245_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
006569|245-en|en|wav/p245_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
006570|245-en|en|wav/p245_016.wav|||Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
006571|245-en|en|wav/p245_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
006572|245-en|en|wav/p245_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
006573|245-en|en|wav/p245_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
006574|245-en|en|wav/p245_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
006575|245-en|en|wav/p245_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
006576|245-en|en|wav/p245_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
006578|245-en|en|wav/p245_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
006579|245-en|en|wav/p245_025.wav|||Johnson was pretty low.|
006580|245-en|en|wav/p245_026.wav|||But it failed.|
006581|245-en|en|wav/p245_027.wav|||It's nice to hear.|
006582|245-en|en|wav/p245_028.wav|||We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.|
006583|245-en|en|wav/p245_029.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|
006584|245-en|en|wav/p245_030.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
006585|245-en|en|wav/p245_031.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
006586|245-en|en|wav/p245_032.wav|||They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.|
006587|245-en|en|wav/p245_033.wav|||I was an athlete.|
006588|245-en|en|wav/p245_034.wav|||They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|
006589|245-en|en|wav/p245_035.wav|||So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|
006590|245-en|en|wav/p245_036.wav|||Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|
006591|245-en|en|wav/p245_037.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
006592|245-en|en|wav/p245_038.wav|||It has failed.|
006593|245-en|en|wav/p245_039.wav|||It was clear.|
006594|245-en|en|wav/p245_040.wav|||It's a great thing.|
006595|245-en|en|wav/p245_041.wav|||Indeed, he does.|
006596|245-en|en|wav/p245_042.wav|||People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|
006597|245-en|en|wav/p245_043.wav|||She is believed to be in South Africa.|
006598|245-en|en|wav/p245_044.wav|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
006599|245-en|en|wav/p245_045.wav|||Sure, it's funny.|
006600|245-en|en|wav/p245_046.wav|||Mexico City was a wonderful experience.|
006601|245-en|en|wav/p245_047.wav|||This represents a tough game for us.|
006602|245-en|en|wav/p245_048.wav|||We need to chat.|
006603|245-en|en|wav/p245_049.wav|||The boy is no longer with us.|
006604|245-en|en|wav/p245_050.wav|||Who can say?|
006605|245-en|en|wav/p245_051.wav|||It's a blessing.|
006606|245-en|en|wav/p245_053.wav|||Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.|
006607|245-en|en|wav/p245_054.wav|||They had to explain it.|
006608|245-en|en|wav/p245_055.wav|||He had no enemies.|
006609|245-en|en|wav/p245_056.wav|||Sadly, it can't.|
006610|245-en|en|wav/p245_057.wav|||None has ever been found.|
006611|245-en|en|wav/p245_058.wav|||It's a matter of balance.|
006612|245-en|en|wav/p245_059.wav|||There will be tough opponents to this report.|
006613|245-en|en|wav/p245_060.wav|||Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|
006614|245-en|en|wav/p245_061.wav|||Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|
006615|245-en|en|wav/p245_062.wav|||He should have asked for a second opinion.|
006616|245-en|en|wav/p245_063.wav|||He was popular.|
006617|245-en|en|wav/p245_064.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
006618|245-en|en|wav/p245_065.wav|||The script was funny.|
006619|245-en|en|wav/p245_066.wav|||You need a trademark.|
006620|245-en|en|wav/p245_067.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
006621|245-en|en|wav/p245_068.wav|||The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|
006622|245-en|en|wav/p245_069.wav|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
006623|245-en|en|wav/p245_070.wav|||Is there a new way forward?|
006624|245-en|en|wav/p245_071.wav|||There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.|
006625|245-en|en|wav/p245_072.wav|||People must remain vigilant.|
006626|245-en|en|wav/p245_073.wav|||This is the way things should be handled.|
006627|245-en|en|wav/p245_074.wav|||Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.|
006628|245-en|en|wav/p245_075.wav|||What has changed?|
006629|245-en|en|wav/p245_076.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
006630|245-en|en|wav/p245_077.wav|||That is bound to happen.|
006631|245-en|en|wav/p245_078.wav|||He seems to be pleased with the picture.|
006632|245-en|en|wav/p245_079.wav|||We have other options.|
006633|245-en|en|wav/p245_080.wav|||The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.|
006634|245-en|en|wav/p245_081.wav|||It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.|
006635|245-en|en|wav/p245_082.wav|||It's never too late.|
006636|245-en|en|wav/p245_083.wav|||Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.|
006637|245-en|en|wav/p245_084.wav|||Now the system is right behind us.|
006638|245-en|en|wav/p245_085.wav|||Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.|
006639|245-en|en|wav/p245_086.wav|||It is a lifeline.|
006640|245-en|en|wav/p245_087.wav|||The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.|
006641|245-en|en|wav/p245_088.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
006642|245-en|en|wav/p245_089.wav|||If you could find it.|
006643|245-en|en|wav/p245_090.wav|||Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.|
006644|245-en|en|wav/p245_091.wav|||They were outside the circle.|
006645|245-en|en|wav/p245_092.wav|||He's a star.|
006646|245-en|en|wav/p245_093.wav|||It was some time before she found out he was safe.|
006647|245-en|en|wav/p245_094.wav|||We want to get to the final, anyway.|
006648|245-en|en|wav/p245_095.wav|||Oil embargo endorsed.|

008461|250-en|en|wav/p250_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
008462|250-en|en|wav/p250_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
008463|250-en|en|wav/p250_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
008464|250-en|en|wav/p250_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
008465|250-en|en|wav/p250_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
008466|250-en|en|wav/p250_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
008467|250-en|en|wav/p250_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

008469|250-en|en|wav/p250_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
008470|250-en|en|wav/p250_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
008471|250-en|en|wav/p250_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
008472|250-en|en|wav/p250_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
008473|250-en|en|wav/p250_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
008474|250-en|en|wav/p250_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
008475|250-en|en|wav/p250_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
008476|250-en|en|wav/p250_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

008941|251-en|en|wav/p251_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

008943|251-en|en|wav/p251_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
008944|251-en|en|wav/p251_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

008953|251-en|en|wav/p251_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
008954|251-en|en|wav/p251_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

008956|251-en|en|wav/p251_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

009270|251-en|en|wav/p251_342.wav|||Is that an issue?|
009271|251-en|en|wav/p251_343.wav|||He can do no wrong.|
009272|251-en|en|wav/p251_344.wav|||Finally, he paid for the movie.|

009274|251-en|en|wav/p251_346.wav|||In Scotland, we keep the faith.|
009275|251-en|en|wav/p251_347.wav|||The team for the first game could be this one.|
009276|251-en|en|wav/p251_348.wav|||The same things will happen with GM foods.|

009283|251-en|en|wav/p251_356.wav|||In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.|
009284|251-en|en|wav/p251_357.wav|||The composer will conduct.|
009285|251-en|en|wav/p251_359.wav|||It is not like working for a living.|

009287|251-en|en|wav/p251_361.wav|||I saw some good things.|

009289|251-en|en|wav/p251_364.wav|||A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.|
009290|251-en|en|wav/p251_365.wav|||The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.|
009291|251-en|en|wav/p251_366.wav|||However, it was well worth the wait.|

009293|251-en|en|wav/p251_368.wav|||We will be homeless.|

009296|251-en|en|wav/p251_373.wav|||It's not pretty, but it's effective.|
009297|251-en|en|wav/p251_374.wav|||His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|
009298|252-en|en|wav/p252_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|

009302|252-en|en|wav/p252_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
009303|252-en|en|wav/p252_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
009304|252-en|en|wav/p252_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
009305|252-en|en|wav/p252_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
009306|252-en|en|wav/p252_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
009307|252-en|en|wav/p252_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
009308|252-en|en|wav/p252_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
009309|252-en|en|wav/p252_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
009310|252-en|en|wav/p252_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
009311|252-en|en|wav/p252_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
009312|252-en|en|wav/p252_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
009313|252-en|en|wav/p252_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
009314|252-en|en|wav/p252_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
009315|252-en|en|wav/p252_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
009316|252-en|en|wav/p252_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
009317|252-en|en|wav/p252_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
009318|252-en|en|wav/p252_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.|
009319|252-en|en|wav/p252_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.|
009321|252-en|en|wav/p252_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

009327|252-en|en|wav/p252_030.wav|||Schools do not create that.|
009328|252-en|en|wav/p252_032.wav|||The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.|
009329|252-en|en|wav/p252_033.wav|||Just look at his fashion sense.|
009330|252-en|en|wav/p252_034.wav|||I have every confidence.|
009331|252-en|en|wav/p252_035.wav|||He added that her comments were noted.|

009333|252-en|en|wav/p252_037.wav|||Instead, we make the ground pay.|
009334|252-en|en|wav/p252_038.wav|||That time may never be broken.|
009335|252-en|en|wav/p252_039.wav|||Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.|
009336|252-en|en|wav/p252_040.wav|||He too started on the subs seats.|
009337|252-en|en|wav/p252_041.wav|||I'm so happy that she did.|
009338|252-en|en|wav/p252_042.wav|||We took part in a festival called Global Dance.|
009339|252-en|en|wav/p252_043.wav|||This operation will change her life.|
009340|252-en|en|wav/p252_044.wav|||Something old something new, as it were.|
009341|252-en|en|wav/p252_045.wav|||The youngsters have put us in a strong position.|
009342|252-en|en|wav/p252_046.wav|||They seem too much of a sure thing.|
009343|252-en|en|wav/p252_047.wav|||That's what set him apart.|
009344|252-en|en|wav/p252_048.wav|||You must always attempt to raise the bar.|
009345|252-en|en|wav/p252_050.wav|||The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.|
009346|252-en|en|wav/p252_051.wav|||She continued to enjoy sport.|
009347|252-en|en|wav/p252_052.wav|||Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.|
009348|252-en|en|wav/p252_053.wav|||By all accounts he was delighted.|
009349|252-en|en|wav/p252_054.wav|||Schools will not want change.|
009350|252-en|en|wav/p252_055.wav|||I think I'm a bit too young.|
009351|252-en|en|wav/p252_056.wav|||He was failed by his health authority.|
009352|252-en|en|wav/p252_057.wav|||We wish to win, but not at any price.|
009353|252-en|en|wav/p252_058.wav|||I agree with you about this.|
009354|252-en|en|wav/p252_059.wav|||Or so he thought.|
009355|252-en|en|wav/p252_060.wav|||Must be prepared to use it.|
009356|252-en|en|wav/p252_061.wav|||The fifth was found later.|
009357|252-en|en|wav/p252_062.wav|||For a decade she was proved right.|
009358|252-en|en|wav/p252_063.wav|||It was dangerous but vital employment.|

009365|252-en|en|wav/p252_071.wav|||This is a great opportunity for us.|
009366|252-en|en|wav/p252_072.wav|||That is not possible.|
009367|252-en|en|wav/p252_073.wav|||None has ever been found.|
009368|252-en|en|wav/p252_074.wav|||Insurance will perhaps reduce.|
009369|252-en|en|wav/p252_075.wav|||Their time has gone.|
009370|252-en|en|wav/p252_076.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|

009382|252-en|en|wav/p252_088.wav|||That remains the same.|
009383|252-en|en|wav/p252_089.wav|||It was exactly four months away.|
009384|252-en|en|wav/p252_090.wav|||There is no issue of national security involved here.|
009385|252-en|en|wav/p252_091.wav|||Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.|
009386|252-en|en|wav/p252_092.wav|||Put simply, it goes something like this.|
009387|252-en|en|wav/p252_093.wav|||Even if he doesn't have any lines.|
009388|252-en|en|wav/p252_094.wav|||The car driver died.|
009389|252-en|en|wav/p252_095.wav|||It looks that way.|
009390|252-en|en|wav/p252_096.wav|||Now comes the hard part.|
009391|252-en|en|wav/p252_097.wav|||We are already seeing some positive results.|
009392|252-en|en|wav/p252_098.wav|||We're at home, which is important.|
009393|252-en|en|wav/p252_099.wav|||They prepared some food very quickly.|
009394|252-en|en|wav/p252_100.wav|||The circumstances have changed since last year.|
009395|252-en|en|wav/p252_101.wav|||In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.|

009404|252-en|en|wav/p252_111.wav|||The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.|
009405|252-en|en|wav/p252_112.wav|||There was no reason.|
009406|252-en|en|wav/p252_113.wav|||It gets too much.|
009407|252-en|en|wav/p252_114.wav|||So they should be.|
009408|252-en|en|wav/p252_115.wav|||No progress has been made.|
009409|252-en|en|wav/p252_116.wav|||They need the money.|
009410|252-en|en|wav/p252_117.wav|||That is the only way to rate players.|
009411|252-en|en|wav/p252_118.wav|||Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.|
009412|252-en|en|wav/p252_119.wav|||Its failure is no surprise.|
009413|252-en|en|wav/p252_120.wav|||No country has a similar training programme.|

009415|252-en|en|wav/p252_122.wav|||Consumers will also benefit.|
009416|252-en|en|wav/p252_123.wav|||They pointed to the site.|
009417|252-en|en|wav/p252_124.wav|||Tony Blair said as little.|
009418|252-en|en|wav/p252_125.wav|||He is at peace with himself.|
009419|252-en|en|wav/p252_126.wav|||Gold admitted as much.|
009420|252-en|en|wav/p252_127.wav|||It seemed like four hours.|
009421|252-en|en|wav/p252_128.wav|||Evidence must not be held back.|
009422|252-en|en|wav/p252_129.wav|||We beat the Welsh team.|
009423|252-en|en|wav/p252_130.wav|||I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.|
009424|252-en|en|wav/p252_131.wav|||Britain's role was to stop it.|

009426|252-en|en|wav/p252_133.wav|||Eight others have followed.|
009427|252-en|en|wav/p252_134.wav|||We're currently looking at the level of support.|
009428|252-en|en|wav/p252_135.wav|||Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.|
009429|252-en|en|wav/p252_136.wav|||Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.|
009430|252-en|en|wav/p252_137.wav|||It's nice to see a very positive style of football.|
009431|252-en|en|wav/p252_138.wav|||No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.|
009432|252-en|en|wav/p252_139.wav|||It should have its own network.|
009433|252-en|en|wav/p252_140.wav|||As our national coach, Brown is done for.|
009434|252-en|en|wav/p252_141.wav|||But this wasn't the full picture.|
009435|252-en|en|wav/p252_142.wav|||That shows the impact it had.|
009436|252-en|en|wav/p252_143.wav|||Domestic orders have also fallen since January.|
009437|252-en|en|wav/p252_144.wav|||I'd always wanted to act.|
009438|252-en|en|wav/p252_145.wav|||We hope he will do until he finally does the double.|
009439|252-en|en|wav/p252_146.wav|||That is a big risk at any price.|

009454|252-en|en|wav/p252_162.wav|||Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.|
009455|252-en|en|wav/p252_163.wav|||Mr Dewar understood that.|
009456|252-en|en|wav/p252_164.wav|||Nato has left them with no other option.|

009467|252-en|en|wav/p252_175.wav|||I made my mind up before we came on tour.|
009468|252-en|en|wav/p252_176.wav|||You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.|
009469|252-en|en|wav/p252_177.wav|||I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.|

010080|254-en|en|wav/p254_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
010081|254-en|en|wav/p254_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
010082|254-en|en|wav/p254_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
010083|254-en|en|wav/p254_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
010084|254-en|en|wav/p254_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
010085|254-en|en|wav/p254_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
010086|254-en|en|wav/p254_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
010087|254-en|en|wav/p254_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
010088|254-en|en|wav/p254_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
010089|254-en|en|wav/p254_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
010090|254-en|en|wav/p254_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
010091|254-en|en|wav/p254_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

010093|254-en|en|wav/p254_026.wav|||But it failed.|

010100|254-en|en|wav/p254_033.wav|||It's a matter of balance.|
010101|254-en|en|wav/p254_034.wav|||We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|

010850|256-en|en|wav/p256_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
010851|256-en|en|wav/p256_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
010852|256-en|en|wav/p256_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
010853|256-en|en|wav/p256_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
010854|256-en|en|wav/p256_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
010855|256-en|en|wav/p256_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
010856|256-en|en|wav/p256_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

010861|256-en|en|wav/p256_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
010862|256-en|en|wav/p256_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
010863|256-en|en|wav/p256_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
010864|256-en|en|wav/p256_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
010865|256-en|en|wav/p256_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
010867|256-en|en|wav/p256_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

011170|257-en|en|wav/p257_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

011182|257-en|en|wav/p257_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
011183|257-en|en|wav/p257_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

011185|257-en|en|wav/p257_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

011487|257-en|en|wav/p257_325.wav|||Indeed, it was magical.|
011488|257-en|en|wav/p257_326.wav|||I've got no secret.|
011489|257-en|en|wav/p257_327.wav|||Look at the witnesses.|
011490|257-en|en|wav/p257_328.wav|||I'm very lucky.|
011491|257-en|en|wav/p257_329.wav|||We must do something.|
011492|257-en|en|wav/p257_330.wav|||He says that he is no different from any other man.|
011493|257-en|en|wav/p257_331.wav|||Alex Ferguson is the same.|
011494|257-en|en|wav/p257_332.wav|||I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.|
011495|257-en|en|wav/p257_333.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
011496|257-en|en|wav/p257_334.wav|||It is not like working for a living.|
011497|257-en|en|wav/p257_335.wav|||It is long gone.|
011498|257-en|en|wav/p257_336.wav|||The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.|
011499|257-en|en|wav/p257_337.wav|||Tell us about it.|
011500|257-en|en|wav/p257_338.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
011501|257-en|en|wav/p257_339.wav|||He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.|
011502|257-en|en|wav/p257_340.wav|||It was very formal.|
011503|257-en|en|wav/p257_341.wav|||The pressure is on Celtic in the main.|
011504|257-en|en|wav/p257_342.wav|||Tyson is overwhelmed.|
011505|257-en|en|wav/p257_343.wav|||We are delighted at the response from potential employers.|
011506|257-en|en|wav/p257_344.wav|||I wanted to go out on a high.|
011507|257-en|en|wav/p257_345.wav|||Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.|
011508|257-en|en|wav/p257_346.wav|||I felt really good until Friday.|
011509|257-en|en|wav/p257_347.wav|||His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.|
011510|257-en|en|wav/p257_348.wav|||He could face a jail sentence.|
011511|257-en|en|wav/p257_349.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
011512|257-en|en|wav/p257_350.wav|||I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.|
011513|257-en|en|wav/p257_351.wav|||I am not willing to say anything about any couple.|
011514|257-en|en|wav/p257_352.wav|||Then followed a bout of flu.|
011515|257-en|en|wav/p257_353.wav|||There is no signature.|
011516|257-en|en|wav/p257_354.wav|||It's a long process.|
011517|257-en|en|wav/p257_355.wav|||It is a large number.|
011518|257-en|en|wav/p257_356.wav|||He knew his job inside out.|
011519|257-en|en|wav/p257_357.wav|||I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|
011520|257-en|en|wav/p257_358.wav|||Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.|
011521|257-en|en|wav/p257_359.wav|||It does not even have a staff shortage.|
011522|257-en|en|wav/p257_360.wav|||I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.|
011523|257-en|en|wav/p257_361.wav|||He has the edge.|
011524|257-en|en|wav/p257_362.wav|||He denied the charge.|
011525|257-en|en|wav/p257_363.wav|||There were no casualties.|
011526|257-en|en|wav/p257_364.wav|||Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|
011527|257-en|en|wav/p257_365.wav|||YOU thought it was a headache.|
011528|257-en|en|wav/p257_366.wav|||Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.|
011529|257-en|en|wav/p257_367.wav|||A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.|
011530|257-en|en|wav/p257_368.wav|||They really did a great job.|
011531|257-en|en|wav/p257_369.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
011532|257-en|en|wav/p257_370.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
011533|257-en|en|wav/p257_371.wav|||This year I understood.|
011534|257-en|en|wav/p257_372.wav|||I'm pleased about one thing.|
011535|257-en|en|wav/p257_373.wav|||It is unusual.|
011536|257-en|en|wav/p257_374.wav|||It is also claimed that he was murdered.|
011537|257-en|en|wav/p257_375.wav|||It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.|
011538|257-en|en|wav/p257_376.wav|||I can lead by example.|
011539|257-en|en|wav/p257_377.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
011540|257-en|en|wav/p257_378.wav|||They are good.|
011541|257-en|en|wav/p257_379.wav|||He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.|
011542|257-en|en|wav/p257_380.wav|||My husband was born in Zimbabwe.|
011543|257-en|en|wav/p257_381.wav|||So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|
011544|257-en|en|wav/p257_382.wav|||It was on fire.|
011545|257-en|en|wav/p257_383.wav|||The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.|
011546|257-en|en|wav/p257_384.wav|||I never won a penny throughout my career.|
011547|257-en|en|wav/p257_385.wav|||Emotions were complex.|
011548|257-en|en|wav/p257_386.wav|||He's already made history.|
011549|257-en|en|wav/p257_387.wav|||So I did.|
011550|257-en|en|wav/p257_388.wav|||You ask the question.|
011551|257-en|en|wav/p257_389.wav|||Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.|
011552|257-en|en|wav/p257_390.wav|||There was no trouble.|
011553|257-en|en|wav/p257_391.wav|||This is a huge confidence boost.|
011554|257-en|en|wav/p257_392.wav|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
011555|257-en|en|wav/p257_393.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
011556|257-en|en|wav/p257_394.wav|||We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.|
011557|257-en|en|wav/p257_395.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
011558|257-en|en|wav/p257_396.wav|||You wanted the evidence.|
011559|257-en|en|wav/p257_397.wav|||Our numbers are small.|
011560|257-en|en|wav/p257_398.wav|||I was very young.|
011561|257-en|en|wav/p257_399.wav|||We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.|
011562|257-en|en|wav/p257_400.wav|||I am the Son of Sam.|
011563|257-en|en|wav/p257_401.wav|||She is superb.|
011564|257-en|en|wav/p257_402.wav|||Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.|
011565|257-en|en|wav/p257_403.wav|||It doesn't always work that way.|
011566|257-en|en|wav/p257_404.wav|||It is simple, but profound.|
011567|257-en|en|wav/p257_405.wav|||No preference emerged.|
011568|257-en|en|wav/p257_406.wav|||But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.|
011569|257-en|en|wav/p257_407.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
011570|257-en|en|wav/p257_408.wav|||She has reached the top of her profession.|
011571|257-en|en|wav/p257_409.wav|||It goes with the job.|
011572|257-en|en|wav/p257_410.wav|||The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.|
011573|257-en|en|wav/p257_411.wav|||Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.|
011574|257-en|en|wav/p257_412.wav|||I recommend a tour.|
011575|257-en|en|wav/p257_413.wav|||We are delighted with this outcome.|
011576|257-en|en|wav/p257_414.wav|||I have so much respect for him.|
011577|257-en|en|wav/p257_415.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
011578|257-en|en|wav/p257_416.wav|||Rather than answer, she resigned.|
011579|257-en|en|wav/p257_417.wav|||War is not the action.|
011580|257-en|en|wav/p257_418.wav|||They said so that I would look good in uniform.|
011581|257-en|en|wav/p257_419.wav|||It's not about defining styles.|
011582|257-en|en|wav/p257_420.wav|||One must hope not!|
011583|257-en|en|wav/p257_421.wav|||It is marvellous.|
011584|257-en|en|wav/p257_422.wav|||But it may take some time to confirm the findings.|
011585|257-en|en|wav/p257_423.wav|||They should not be blamed for it.|
011586|257-en|en|wav/p257_424.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
011587|257-en|en|wav/p257_425.wav|||It is bizarre.|
011588|257-en|en|wav/p257_426.wav|||Mary Archer is almost too clever.|
011589|257-en|en|wav/p257_427.wav|||I was just overwhelmed.|
011590|257-en|en|wav/p257_428.wav|||It had been in place since last July.|
011591|257-en|en|wav/p257_429.wav|||It's a miracle.|
011592|257-en|en|wav/p257_430.wav|||The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.|
011593|257-en|en|wav/p257_431.wav|||That was the first time I worked with Richard.|
011594|257-en|en|wav/p257_432.wav|||They will form a tribute.|
011595|257-en|en|wav/p257_433.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
011596|257-en|en|wav/p257_434.wav|||The bill would be massive.|
011597|258-en|en|wav/p258_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
011598|258-en|en|wav/p258_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
011599|258-en|en|wav/p258_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
011600|258-en|en|wav/p258_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
011601|258-en|en|wav/p258_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
011602|258-en|en|wav/p258_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
011603|258-en|en|wav/p258_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
011604|258-en|en|wav/p258_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
011605|258-en|en|wav/p258_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
011606|258-en|en|wav/p258_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
011607|258-en|en|wav/p258_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
011608|258-en|en|wav/p258_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
011609|258-en|en|wav/p258_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
011610|258-en|en|wav/p258_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
011611|258-en|en|wav/p258_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
011612|258-en|en|wav/p258_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
011613|258-en|en|wav/p258_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
011614|258-en|en|wav/p258_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
011615|258-en|en|wav/p258_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
011616|258-en|en|wav/p258_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
011617|258-en|en|wav/p258_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
011618|258-en|en|wav/p258_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
011619|258-en|en|wav/p258_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
011620|258-en|en|wav/p258_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
011621|258-en|en|wav/p258_025.wav|||Johnson was pretty low.|
011622|258-en|en|wav/p258_026.wav|||It's nice to hear.|
011623|258-en|en|wav/p258_027.wav|||People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|
011624|258-en|en|wav/p258_028.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
011625|258-en|en|wav/p258_029.wav|||Because it's a waste of time for both sides.|
011626|258-en|en|wav/p258_030.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
011627|258-en|en|wav/p258_031.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
011628|258-en|en|wav/p258_032.wav|||He took me on a tour of the wards.|
011629|258-en|en|wav/p258_033.wav|||They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.|
011630|258-en|en|wav/p258_034.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
011631|258-en|en|wav/p258_035.wav|||It was clear.|
011632|258-en|en|wav/p258_036.wav|||It is not for any other purpose.|
011633|258-en|en|wav/p258_037.wav|||President Bush is at war.|
011634|258-en|en|wav/p258_038.wav|||I was scared.|
011635|258-en|en|wav/p258_039.wav|||It will come all right.|
011636|258-en|en|wav/p258_040.wav|||It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.|
011637|258-en|en|wav/p258_041.wav|||The judge said.|
011638|258-en|en|wav/p258_042.wav|||We need to chat.|
011639|258-en|en|wav/p258_043.wav|||It's a blessing.|
011640|258-en|en|wav/p258_044.wav|||As she explains.|
011641|258-en|en|wav/p258_045.wav|||She looked so young.|
011642|258-en|en|wav/p258_046.wav|||He looks like an Afghan.|
011643|258-en|en|wav/p258_047.wav|||It is the whole package.|
011644|258-en|en|wav/p258_048.wav|||I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.|
011645|258-en|en|wav/p258_049.wav|||We were surprised to see the photograph.|
011646|258-en|en|wav/p258_050.wav|||That's the day job.|
011647|258-en|en|wav/p258_051.wav|||We have not given up hope.|
011648|258-en|en|wav/p258_052.wav|||You must have a government and a good civil service.|
011649|258-en|en|wav/p258_053.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
011650|258-en|en|wav/p258_054.wav|||It's that kind of place.|
011651|258-en|en|wav/p258_055.wav|||Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|
011652|258-en|en|wav/p258_056.wav|||And if he hadn't become a musician?|
011653|258-en|en|wav/p258_057.wav|||He was popular.|
011654|258-en|en|wav/p258_058.wav|||It should be devolved.|
011655|258-en|en|wav/p258_059.wav|||We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.|
011656|258-en|en|wav/p258_060.wav|||Try to save us.|
011657|258-en|en|wav/p258_061.wav|||He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.|
011658|258-en|en|wav/p258_062.wav|||Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|
011659|258-en|en|wav/p258_063.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
011660|258-en|en|wav/p258_064.wav|||That was the easy election.|
011661|258-en|en|wav/p258_065.wav|||It's all I can do.|
011662|258-en|en|wav/p258_066.wav|||The price cuts are really exciting.|
011663|258-en|en|wav/p258_067.wav|||Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|
011664|258-en|en|wav/p258_068.wav|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
011665|258-en|en|wav/p258_069.wav|||The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.|
011666|258-en|en|wav/p258_070.wav|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
011667|258-en|en|wav/p258_071.wav|||He got the same story.|
011668|258-en|en|wav/p258_072.wav|||This is the way things should be handled.|
011669|258-en|en|wav/p258_073.wav|||It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|
011670|258-en|en|wav/p258_074.wav|||It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.|
011671|258-en|en|wav/p258_075.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
011672|258-en|en|wav/p258_076.wav|||I first met him last summer.|
011673|258-en|en|wav/p258_077.wav|||Last week, he was taken into hospital.|
011674|258-en|en|wav/p258_078.wav|||Nothing is yet confirmed.|

011678|258-en|en|wav/p258_082.wav|||The city council is a major property owner in the area.|
011679|258-en|en|wav/p258_083.wav|||Today I couldn't run on it.|
011680|258-en|en|wav/p258_084.wav|||They are different types.|
011681|258-en|en|wav/p258_085.wav|||It is a simple equation.|
011682|258-en|en|wav/p258_086.wav|||Until you hit the big games.|
011683|258-en|en|wav/p258_087.wav|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
011684|258-en|en|wav/p258_088.wav|||There was no rescue.|
011685|258-en|en|wav/p258_089.wav|||She's got to say something.|

012854|261-en|en|wav/p261_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
012855|261-en|en|wav/p261_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

012858|261-en|en|wav/p261_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

012860|261-en|en|wav/p261_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

012865|261-en|en|wav/p261_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
012866|261-en|en|wav/p261_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
012867|261-en|en|wav/p261_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
012868|261-en|en|wav/p261_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
012869|261-en|en|wav/p261_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
012870|261-en|en|wav/p261_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

013201|261-en|en|wav/p261_354.wav|||It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.|
013202|261-en|en|wav/p261_355.wav|||To beat the European champion is quite nice.|
013203|261-en|en|wav/p261_356.wav|||I've got a sense of humour, too.|

013215|261-en|en|wav/p261_368.wav|||Neither man has been charged.|
013216|261-en|en|wav/p261_369.wav|||Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.|
013217|261-en|en|wav/p261_370.wav|||The idea was first mooted a year ago.|
013218|261-en|en|wav/p261_371.wav|||He did a good job.|
013219|261-en|en|wav/p261_372.wav|||Had this been common practice ?|

013232|261-en|en|wav/p261_385.wav|||From our point of view, the player is free to leave.|
013233|261-en|en|wav/p261_386.wav|||On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.|
013234|261-en|en|wav/p261_387.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|

013254|261-en|en|wav/p261_407.wav|||He put some colour into Scottish history.|
013255|261-en|en|wav/p261_408.wav|||This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|
013256|261-en|en|wav/p261_409.wav|||It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|
013257|261-en|en|wav/p261_410.wav|||Motion described it as a unique event.|

013263|261-en|en|wav/p261_416.wav|||However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|
013264|261-en|en|wav/p261_417.wav|||Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|
013265|261-en|en|wav/p261_418.wav|||Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.|
013266|261-en|en|wav/p261_419.wav|||But a surprise is in store.|
013267|261-en|en|wav/p261_420.wav|||Smoking is also very important.|
013268|261-en|en|wav/p261_421.wav|||The second goal was superb.|
013269|261-en|en|wav/p261_422.wav|||We're delighted about the vote.|
013270|261-en|en|wav/p261_423.wav|||The case will now go to appeal.|

013277|261-en|en|wav/p261_430.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
013278|261-en|en|wav/p261_431.wav|||That's the way it works.|
013279|261-en|en|wav/p261_432.wav|||The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|
013280|261-en|en|wav/p261_433.wav|||It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|
013281|261-en|en|wav/p261_434.wav|||Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.|
013282|261-en|en|wav/p261_435.wav|||He is on the wrong side.|

013721|263-en|en|wav/p263_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
013722|263-en|en|wav/p263_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
013723|263-en|en|wav/p263_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
013724|263-en|en|wav/p263_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
013725|263-en|en|wav/p263_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
013726|263-en|en|wav/p263_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
013727|263-en|en|wav/p263_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
013728|263-en|en|wav/p263_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
013729|263-en|en|wav/p263_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
013730|263-en|en|wav/p263_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

013732|263-en|en|wav/p263_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
013733|263-en|en|wav/p263_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
013734|263-en|en|wav/p263_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
013735|263-en|en|wav/p263_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
013736|263-en|en|wav/p263_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
013737|263-en|en|wav/p263_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
013738|263-en|en|wav/p263_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
013739|263-en|en|wav/p263_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

015023|266-en|en|wav/p266_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
015024|266-en|en|wav/p266_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
015025|266-en|en|wav/p266_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
015026|266-en|en|wav/p266_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
015027|266-en|en|wav/p266_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
015028|266-en|en|wav/p266_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
015029|266-en|en|wav/p266_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
015030|266-en|en|wav/p266_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

015034|266-en|en|wav/p266_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
015035|266-en|en|wav/p266_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
015036|266-en|en|wav/p266_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
015037|266-en|en|wav/p266_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
015038|266-en|en|wav/p266_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
015039|266-en|en|wav/p266_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
015040|266-en|en|wav/p266_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
015041|266-en|en|wav/p266_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
015042|266-en|en|wav/p266_025.wav|||She looked so young.|
015043|266-en|en|wav/p266_026.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|

015072|266-en|en|wav/p266_055.wav|||We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.|
015073|266-en|en|wav/p266_056.wav|||They're appalled by that.|

019264|275-en|en|wav/p275_391.wav|||It was a breathtaking moment.|
019265|275-en|en|wav/p275_392.wav|||What happened in the summer?|

019272|275-en|en|wav/p275_399.wav|||It is an absolute nonsense.|
019273|275-en|en|wav/p275_400.wav|||However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|
019274|275-en|en|wav/p275_402.wav|||But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.|
019275|275-en|en|wav/p275_403.wav|||It might be.|
019276|275-en|en|wav/p275_404.wav|||Feel the air, the space.|

019304|276-en|en|wav/p276_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
019305|276-en|en|wav/p276_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
019306|276-en|en|wav/p276_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
019307|276-en|en|wav/p276_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
019308|276-en|en|wav/p276_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
019309|276-en|en|wav/p276_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
019310|276-en|en|wav/p276_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
019311|276-en|en|wav/p276_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
019312|276-en|en|wav/p276_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
019313|276-en|en|wav/p276_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
019314|276-en|en|wav/p276_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
019315|276-en|en|wav/p276_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
019316|276-en|en|wav/p276_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
019317|276-en|en|wav/p276_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
019318|276-en|en|wav/p276_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
019319|276-en|en|wav/p276_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
019320|276-en|en|wav/p276_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
019321|276-en|en|wav/p276_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
019322|276-en|en|wav/p276_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
019323|276-en|en|wav/p276_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

019328|276-en|en|wav/p276_029.wav|||What do we do ?|
019329|276-en|en|wav/p276_030.wav|||They might have asked, for goodness sake.|
019330|276-en|en|wav/p276_031.wav|||Smoking is also very important.|
019331|276-en|en|wav/p276_032.wav|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
019332|276-en|en|wav/p276_033.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|

020637|279-en|en|wav/p279_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

020652|279-en|en|wav/p279_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

021041|280-en|en|wav/p280_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
021042|280-en|en|wav/p280_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
021043|280-en|en|wav/p280_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
021044|280-en|en|wav/p280_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
021045|280-en|en|wav/p280_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
021046|280-en|en|wav/p280_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
021047|280-en|en|wav/p280_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
021048|280-en|en|wav/p280_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

021053|280-en|en|wav/p280_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
021054|280-en|en|wav/p280_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
021055|280-en|en|wav/p280_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
021056|280-en|en|wav/p280_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
021057|280-en|en|wav/p280_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
021059|280-en|en|wav/p280_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

021080|280-en|en|wav/p280_045.wav|||Does it matter ?|
021081|280-en|en|wav/p280_046.wav|||How do you take them away ?|
021082|280-en|en|wav/p280_047.wav|||However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|

021149|280-en|en|wav/p280_114.wav|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
021150|280-en|en|wav/p280_115.wav|||So what happens next ?|
021151|280-en|en|wav/p280_116.wav|||Had this been common practice ?|
021152|280-en|en|wav/p280_117.wav|||What do they want us to do ?|
021153|280-en|en|wav/p280_118.wav|||The idea is the shop within a shop.|

021775|281-en|en|wav/p281_331.wav|||It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.|
021776|281-en|en|wav/p281_332.wav|||But the Farmer is bemused.|
021777|281-en|en|wav/p281_333.wav|||To beat the European champion is quite nice.|
021778|281-en|en|wav/p281_334.wav|||However, the groups denied the claims.|
021779|281-en|en|wav/p281_335.wav|||The airport was even different.|

021781|281-en|en|wav/p281_337.wav|||Does that put pressure on us ?|
021782|281-en|en|wav/p281_338.wav|||Did it work ?|
021783|281-en|en|wav/p281_339.wav|||Do you think we are a top nation ?|
021784|281-en|en|wav/p281_340.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
021785|281-en|en|wav/p281_341.wav|||It's just the way I play.|
021786|281-en|en|wav/p281_342.wav|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
021787|281-en|en|wav/p281_343.wav|||Last night, he pledged to clear his name.|

021811|281-en|en|wav/p281_367.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
021812|281-en|en|wav/p281_368.wav|||The major championships will always have a special place.|
021813|281-en|en|wav/p281_369.wav|||She said they would appeal.|
021814|281-en|en|wav/p281_370.wav|||They were to blame for the first two goals.|
021815|281-en|en|wav/p281_371.wav|||There is no deal as yet.|
021816|281-en|en|wav/p281_372.wav|||It's as wide as a church in here.|
021817|281-en|en|wav/p281_373.wav|||The shares are a strong hold.|
021818|281-en|en|wav/p281_374.wav|||It would be quite nice.|

021826|281-en|en|wav/p281_382.wav|||On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|
021827|281-en|en|wav/p281_383.wav|||He has an equity stake in the investment house.|
021828|281-en|en|wav/p281_384.wav|||Our policy is very clear on this issue.|

021832|281-en|en|wav/p281_388.wav|||A review is under way.|
021833|281-en|en|wav/p281_389.wav|||It is a simple equation.|

021838|281-en|en|wav/p281_394.wav|||What are they for ?|
021839|281-en|en|wav/p281_395.wav|||Is there a waiting list ?|
021840|281-en|en|wav/p281_396.wav|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
021841|281-en|en|wav/p281_397.wav|||That investment has now been secured.|

021848|281-en|en|wav/p281_404.wav|||However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|
021849|281-en|en|wav/p281_405.wav|||It had been on the cards.|
021850|281-en|en|wav/p281_406.wav|||He took a draw on his cigarette.|
021851|281-en|en|wav/p281_407.wav|||It was the same expression of joy.|
021852|281-en|en|wav/p281_408.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
021853|281-en|en|wav/p281_409.wav|||Yet the data is compelling.|
021854|281-en|en|wav/p281_410.wav|||That was a touch of class.|
021855|281-en|en|wav/p281_411.wav|||One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|
021856|281-en|en|wav/p281_412.wav|||That is a personal matter.|

021859|281-en|en|wav/p281_415.wav|||Is it worth it ?|
021860|281-en|en|wav/p281_416.wav|||Does it matter ?|
021861|281-en|en|wav/p281_417.wav|||How do you take them away ?|
021862|281-en|en|wav/p281_418.wav|||However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|
021863|281-en|en|wav/p281_419.wav|||After the match, do you ?|
021864|281-en|en|wav/p281_420.wav|||I am delighted for them.|
021865|281-en|en|wav/p281_421.wav|||Footballers have also been targeted.|

021870|281-en|en|wav/p281_426.wav|||The professor is in no doubt.|
021871|281-en|en|wav/p281_427.wav|||It was a poor performance.|
021872|281-en|en|wav/p281_428.wav|||This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.|
021873|281-en|en|wav/p281_429.wav|||John Daly has a burning ambition.|
021874|281-en|en|wav/p281_430.wav|||Once again, they would be wrong.|
021875|281-en|en|wav/p281_431.wav|||Together, we can make a difference.|
021876|281-en|en|wav/p281_432.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
021877|281-en|en|wav/p281_433.wav|||It is an absolute nonsense.|
021878|281-en|en|wav/p281_434.wav|||We might be back next year.|
021879|281-en|en|wav/p281_435.wav|||However, the players should have a voice in these matters.|
021880|281-en|en|wav/p281_436.wav|||Size is not the issue.|
021881|281-en|en|wav/p281_437.wav|||It was support as it should be.|
021882|281-en|en|wav/p281_438.wav|||I didn't get to keep it.|
021883|281-en|en|wav/p281_439.wav|||It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.|
021884|281-en|en|wav/p281_440.wav|||THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.|
021885|281-en|en|wav/p281_441.wav|||He deserves a second chance.|
021886|281-en|en|wav/p281_442.wav|||It is pretty bad news.|
021887|281-en|en|wav/p281_443.wav|||We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.|
021888|281-en|en|wav/p281_444.wav|||Her body was found about four miles from the car.|
021889|281-en|en|wav/p281_445.wav|||We just got a phone call on Saturday night.|

021891|281-en|en|wav/p281_447.wav|||I was embarrassed by it.|
021892|281-en|en|wav/p281_448.wav|||That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.|
021893|281-en|en|wav/p281_449.wav|||She came to the Highland Show.|
021894|281-en|en|wav/p281_450.wav|||Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.|
021895|281-en|en|wav/p281_451.wav|||We have the location, which is assured.|
021896|281-en|en|wav/p281_452.wav|||They were good years for him.|
021897|281-en|en|wav/p281_453.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
021898|281-en|en|wav/p281_454.wav|||This is the stuff of live music.|
021899|281-en|en|wav/p281_455.wav|||She has now been registered as disabled.|
021900|281-en|en|wav/p281_456.wav|||We could hardly believe it.|
021901|281-en|en|wav/p281_457.wav|||The men are very worried.|
021902|281-en|en|wav/p281_458.wav|||Both promotions come as no surprise.|
021903|281-en|en|wav/p281_459.wav|||We are going through the process.|
021904|281-en|en|wav/p281_460.wav|||It must never be seen as second class.|
021905|282-en|en|wav/p282_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
021906|282-en|en|wav/p282_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
021907|282-en|en|wav/p282_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
021908|282-en|en|wav/p282_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
021909|282-en|en|wav/p282_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
021910|282-en|en|wav/p282_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
021911|282-en|en|wav/p282_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
021912|282-en|en|wav/p282_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
021913|282-en|en|wav/p282_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
021914|282-en|en|wav/p282_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
021915|282-en|en|wav/p282_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
021916|282-en|en|wav/p282_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
021917|282-en|en|wav/p282_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
021918|282-en|en|wav/p282_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
021919|282-en|en|wav/p282_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
021920|282-en|en|wav/p282_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
021921|282-en|en|wav/p282_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
021922|282-en|en|wav/p282_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
021923|282-en|en|wav/p282_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
021924|282-en|en|wav/p282_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
021925|282-en|en|wav/p282_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
021927|282-en|en|wav/p282_025.wav|||But it failed.|
021928|282-en|en|wav/p282_026.wav|||Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|
021929|282-en|en|wav/p282_027.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|
021930|282-en|en|wav/p282_028.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
021931|282-en|en|wav/p282_029.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
021932|282-en|en|wav/p282_030.wav|||This is the window.|
021933|282-en|en|wav/p282_031.wav|||He was jailed for five years.|
021934|282-en|en|wav/p282_032.wav|||Help is needed.|
021935|282-en|en|wav/p282_033.wav|||Then, suddenly, they weren't.|
021936|282-en|en|wav/p282_034.wav|||It is marvellous.|
021937|282-en|en|wav/p282_035.wav|||Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.|
021938|282-en|en|wav/p282_036.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
021939|282-en|en|wav/p282_037.wav|||They're just different.|
021940|282-en|en|wav/p282_038.wav|||It was clear.|

021942|282-en|en|wav/p282_040.wav|||People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.|
021943|282-en|en|wav/p282_041.wav|||Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.|
021944|282-en|en|wav/p282_042.wav|||Dancing was her life.|
021945|282-en|en|wav/p282_043.wav|||The ambition this year is to improve on last.|
021946|282-en|en|wav/p282_044.wav|||It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.|
021947|282-en|en|wav/p282_045.wav|||They want to be entertained.|
021948|282-en|en|wav/p282_046.wav|||It's the only thing.|
021949|282-en|en|wav/p282_047.wav|||You had better believe it.|
021950|282-en|en|wav/p282_048.wav|||Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.|
021951|282-en|en|wav/p282_049.wav|||On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.|
021952|282-en|en|wav/p282_050.wav|||A neighbour said.|
021953|282-en|en|wav/p282_051.wav|||It is bizarre.|
021954|282-en|en|wav/p282_052.wav|||There is no reason at all.|
021955|282-en|en|wav/p282_053.wav|||In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.|
021956|282-en|en|wav/p282_054.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
021957|282-en|en|wav/p282_055.wav|||Our people are ready.|
021958|282-en|en|wav/p282_056.wav|||Here's a clue.|
021959|282-en|en|wav/p282_057.wav|||I was lost.|
021960|282-en|en|wav/p282_058.wav|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
021961|282-en|en|wav/p282_059.wav|||My fitness was very poor.|
021962|282-en|en|wav/p282_060.wav|||Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.|
021963|282-en|en|wav/p282_061.wav|||It is unique.|
021964|282-en|en|wav/p282_062.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|

022279|283-en|en|wav/p283_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
022280|283-en|en|wav/p283_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
022281|283-en|en|wav/p283_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
022282|283-en|en|wav/p283_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
022283|283-en|en|wav/p283_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

022290|283-en|en|wav/p283_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
022291|283-en|en|wav/p283_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
022292|283-en|en|wav/p283_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
022293|283-en|en|wav/p283_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
022294|283-en|en|wav/p283_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
022296|283-en|en|wav/p283_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

022301|283-en|en|wav/p283_029.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
022302|283-en|en|wav/p283_030.wav|||And we have a singer.|
022303|283-en|en|wav/p283_031.wav|||Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|

022305|283-en|en|wav/p283_033.wav|||It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|
022306|283-en|en|wav/p283_034.wav|||Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|
022307|283-en|en|wav/p283_035.wav|||It could well be the case.|
022308|283-en|en|wav/p283_036.wav|||It is not for any other purpose.|

022596|283-en|en|wav/p283_324.wav|||What form did that take ?|
022597|283-en|en|wav/p283_326.wav|||What are they for ?|
022598|283-en|en|wav/p283_327.wav|||Is there a waiting list ?|

022618|283-en|en|wav/p283_347.wav|||But I think it's different from the rest!|
022619|283-en|en|wav/p283_348.wav|||It is a matter of clarity.|

022623|283-en|en|wav/p283_352.wav|||Another reason is a shortage of stock.|

022625|283-en|en|wav/p283_354.wav|||My life is exactly the same.|
022626|283-en|en|wav/p283_356.wav|||He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.|

022651|283-en|en|wav/p283_381.wav|||Had this been common practice ?|

022653|283-en|en|wav/p283_383.wav|||Is it worth it ?|
022654|283-en|en|wav/p283_384.wav|||Does it matter ?|
022655|283-en|en|wav/p283_385.wav|||That can be good for us.|
022656|283-en|en|wav/p283_386.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
022657|283-en|en|wav/p283_387.wav|||But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.|
022658|283-en|en|wav/p283_388.wav|||They were to blame for the first two goals.|

022674|283-en|en|wav/p283_404.wav|||It took about an hour for the gas to clear.|
022675|283-en|en|wav/p283_405.wav|||There is a lack of logic.|
022676|283-en|en|wav/p283_406.wav|||That investment has now been secured.|
022677|283-en|en|wav/p283_407.wav|||I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.|
022678|283-en|en|wav/p283_408.wav|||It proved a good decision.|
022679|283-en|en|wav/p283_409.wav|||Colour was at the core of his life.|

022682|283-en|en|wav/p283_412.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
022683|283-en|en|wav/p283_413.wav|||I was Scottish on the basis of my family.|
022684|283-en|en|wav/p283_414.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
022685|283-en|en|wav/p283_415.wav|||They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.|
022686|283-en|en|wav/p283_416.wav|||I remain a buyer of the shares.|
022687|283-en|en|wav/p283_417.wav|||The second goal was superb.|
022688|283-en|en|wav/p283_418.wav|||That's all I can say.|
022689|283-en|en|wav/p283_419.wav|||How do you take them away ?|
022690|283-en|en|wav/p283_420.wav|||However, there is an issue, isn't there ?|
022691|283-en|en|wav/p283_421.wav|||After the match, do you ?|
022692|283-en|en|wav/p283_422.wav|||I am astonished at attack.|
022693|283-en|en|wav/p283_423.wav|||I was pleased with my own game.|
022694|283-en|en|wav/p283_424.wav|||Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.|
022695|283-en|en|wav/p283_425.wav|||Yet the data is compelling.|
022696|283-en|en|wav/p283_426.wav|||No date has been set for a meeting.|
022697|283-en|en|wav/p283_427.wav|||One day, he threw the baby against a wall.|
022698|283-en|en|wav/p283_428.wav|||That is a personal matter.|
022699|283-en|en|wav/p283_429.wav|||I'm pleased about one thing.|
022700|283-en|en|wav/p283_430.wav|||My aim is a top six finish.|
022701|283-en|en|wav/p283_431.wav|||These guys are looking for business.|
022702|283-en|en|wav/p283_432.wav|||He is on the wrong side.|
022703|283-en|en|wav/p283_433.wav|||I would rather look at him.|
022704|283-en|en|wav/p283_434.wav|||It needs to be volatile.|
022705|283-en|en|wav/p283_435.wav|||Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|
022706|283-en|en|wav/p283_436.wav|||It is based on a true story.|
022707|283-en|en|wav/p283_437.wav|||But, in fact, the reverse is true.|
022708|283-en|en|wav/p283_438.wav|||Being with me is an honour.|
022709|283-en|en|wav/p283_439.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|

022712|283-en|en|wav/p283_442.wav|||We shall not forget him.|
022713|283-en|en|wav/p283_443.wav|||I can almost pretend to be Scottish.|
022714|283-en|en|wav/p283_444.wav|||Everything in golf is a balance.|
022715|283-en|en|wav/p283_445.wav|||THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.|
022716|283-en|en|wav/p283_446.wav|||Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|
022717|283-en|en|wav/p283_447.wav|||Something has got to give.|
022718|283-en|en|wav/p283_448.wav|||Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.|
022719|283-en|en|wav/p283_449.wav|||If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.|
022720|283-en|en|wav/p283_450.wav|||We went straight into the bedroom.|
022721|283-en|en|wav/p283_451.wav|||I do not see it as some kind of reward.|
022722|283-en|en|wav/p283_452.wav|||But we have built a platform for next season.|
022723|283-en|en|wav/p283_453.wav|||I was embarrassed by it.|
022724|283-en|en|wav/p283_454.wav|||That should be the subject matter of a public debate.|
022725|283-en|en|wav/p283_455.wav|||They had learned from the lessons of the first game.|
022726|283-en|en|wav/p283_456.wav|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
022727|283-en|en|wav/p283_457.wav|||I'd never run for them.|
022728|283-en|en|wav/p283_458.wav|||She came to the Highland Show.|

022731|283-en|en|wav/p283_461.wav|||She has reached the top of her profession.|
022732|283-en|en|wav/p283_462.wav|||Let that be their memorial.|
022733|283-en|en|wav/p283_463.wav|||This morning I got a call from my wife.|
022734|283-en|en|wav/p283_464.wav|||She has now been registered as disabled.|
022735|283-en|en|wav/p283_465.wav|||The move is considered a major breakthrough.|
022736|283-en|en|wav/p283_466.wav|||The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.|
022737|283-en|en|wav/p283_467.wav|||It all began as an accident.|
022738|283-en|en|wav/p283_468.wav|||We are going through the process.|
022739|283-en|en|wav/p283_469.wav|||Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.|
022740|283-en|en|wav/p283_470.wav|||City sentiment is in his favour.|
022741|283-en|en|wav/p283_471.wav|||It's been a long, long journey.|
022742|284-en|en|wav/p284_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
022743|284-en|en|wav/p284_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
022744|284-en|en|wav/p284_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
022745|284-en|en|wav/p284_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
022746|284-en|en|wav/p284_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
022747|284-en|en|wav/p284_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
022748|284-en|en|wav/p284_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
022749|284-en|en|wav/p284_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
022750|284-en|en|wav/p284_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
022751|284-en|en|wav/p284_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
022752|284-en|en|wav/p284_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
022753|284-en|en|wav/p284_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
022754|284-en|en|wav/p284_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
022755|284-en|en|wav/p284_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
022756|284-en|en|wav/p284_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
022757|284-en|en|wav/p284_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
022758|284-en|en|wav/p284_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
022759|284-en|en|wav/p284_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
022760|284-en|en|wav/p284_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
022761|284-en|en|wav/p284_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
022762|284-en|en|wav/p284_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
022763|284-en|en|wav/p284_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
022764|284-en|en|wav/p284_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
022765|284-en|en|wav/p284_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.|
022766|284-en|en|wav/p284_025.wav|||Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.|
022767|284-en|en|wav/p284_026.wav|||We will be homeless.|
022768|284-en|en|wav/p284_027.wav|||Is this accurate?|
022769|284-en|en|wav/p284_028.wav|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
022770|284-en|en|wav/p284_029.wav|||They have no history.|
022771|284-en|en|wav/p284_030.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
022772|284-en|en|wav/p284_031.wav|||I'd just like to play.|

023179|285-en|en|wav/p285_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

024044|287-en|en|wav/p287_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
024045|287-en|en|wav/p287_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

024055|287-en|en|wav/p287_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
024056|287-en|en|wav/p287_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
024057|287-en|en|wav/p287_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
024058|287-en|en|wav/p287_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

024122|287-en|en|wav/p287_085.wav|||It was clear on Thursday.|
024123|287-en|en|wav/p287_086.wav|||We would hope to make progress on that next year.|

024131|287-en|en|wav/p287_094.wav|||The cause of the fire is not yet known.|
024132|287-en|en|wav/p287_095.wav|||It would be the end of farming.|
024133|287-en|en|wav/p287_096.wav|||It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.|
024134|287-en|en|wav/p287_097.wav|||It's not a lack of confidence.|
024135|287-en|en|wav/p287_098.wav|||We have got a race.|

024171|287-en|en|wav/p287_134.wav|||It has become a way of life.|
024172|287-en|en|wav/p287_135.wav|||We will provide immediate access.|
024173|287-en|en|wav/p287_136.wav|||It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.|

024469|288-en|en|wav/p288_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

024481|288-en|en|wav/p288_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
024482|288-en|en|wav/p288_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

024484|288-en|en|wav/p288_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

025214|292-en|en|wav/p292_354.wav|||The board of governors must act.|
025215|292-en|en|wav/p292_355.wav|||That didn't happen for two reasons.|
025216|292-en|en|wav/p292_356.wav|||It is time for a new approach.|
025217|292-en|en|wav/p292_357.wav|||Now they have decided to have a rethink.|
025218|292-en|en|wav/p292_358.wav|||Tiger is the exception.|
025219|292-en|en|wav/p292_359.wav|||There's no choice is there?|
025220|292-en|en|wav/p292_360.wav|||Does it, Noel?|
025221|292-en|en|wav/p292_361.wav|||Do not forget about Monaco.|
025222|292-en|en|wav/p292_362.wav|||You can't give in to the vandals.|
025223|292-en|en|wav/p292_363.wav|||Glasgow is far from overload.|
025224|292-en|en|wav/p292_364.wav|||Everything was an effort.|
025225|292-en|en|wav/p292_365.wav|||And does it even matter?|
025226|292-en|en|wav/p292_366.wav|||My parents are exhausted.|
025227|292-en|en|wav/p292_367.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
025228|292-en|en|wav/p292_368.wav|||That's why he is a national treasure.|
025229|292-en|en|wav/p292_369.wav|||I'm delighted for Andy.|
025230|292-en|en|wav/p292_370.wav|||And how he kept his word.|
025231|292-en|en|wav/p292_371.wav|||It's their duty to protect them.|
025232|292-en|en|wav/p292_372.wav|||The Cup has come home.|
025233|292-en|en|wav/p292_373.wav|||This is a big, big win.|
025234|292-en|en|wav/p292_374.wav|||As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.|
025235|292-en|en|wav/p292_375.wav|||That's an equally important factor.|
025236|292-en|en|wav/p292_376.wav|||We were given a break.|
025237|292-en|en|wav/p292_377.wav|||It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|
025238|292-en|en|wav/p292_378.wav|||That would have killed the match.|
025239|292-en|en|wav/p292_379.wav|||That's not like us at all.|
025240|292-en|en|wav/p292_380.wav|||Scottish teams have got to take their chances.|
025241|292-en|en|wav/p292_381.wav|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|
025242|292-en|en|wav/p292_382.wav|||You have to rely on each other.|
025243|292-en|en|wav/p292_383.wav|||Politics is a tough game.|
025244|292-en|en|wav/p292_384.wav|||This season has been a nightmare.|
025245|292-en|en|wav/p292_385.wav|||Everyone could see the joke.|

025247|292-en|en|wav/p292_387.wav|||Billy knew he was attracted to women.|
025248|292-en|en|wav/p292_388.wav|||The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.|
025249|292-en|en|wav/p292_389.wav|||Such cases are on the increase.|
025250|292-en|en|wav/p292_390.wav|||This was not helpful.|
025251|292-en|en|wav/p292_391.wav|||The police are not the target.|
025252|292-en|en|wav/p292_392.wav|||It's a true story.|
025253|292-en|en|wav/p292_393.wav|||John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|
025254|292-en|en|wav/p292_394.wav|||But that title is a mistake.|
025255|292-en|en|wav/p292_395.wav|||It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|
025256|292-en|en|wav/p292_396.wav|||I'd rather have been playing.|
025257|292-en|en|wav/p292_397.wav|||I am immensely sad.|
025258|292-en|en|wav/p292_398.wav|||Several others were absent.|
025259|292-en|en|wav/p292_399.wav|||It is surprising to come back this way.|
025260|292-en|en|wav/p292_400.wav|||Life is about people, and how you feel about people.|
025261|292-en|en|wav/p292_401.wav|||Could they perhaps be related?|
025262|292-en|en|wav/p292_402.wav|||We all thought we were going to die.|

025268|292-en|en|wav/p292_408.wav|||I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.|
025269|292-en|en|wav/p292_409.wav|||It is good for Europe.|

025272|292-en|en|wav/p292_412.wav|||They would not tell us.|
025273|292-en|en|wav/p292_413.wav|||The balance is all wrong in this country.|
025274|292-en|en|wav/p292_414.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
025275|292-en|en|wav/p292_415.wav|||It is my decision and my decision alone.|
025276|292-en|en|wav/p292_416.wav|||A venue was found.|
025277|292-en|en|wav/p292_417.wav|||I will always remember the horrible images.|
025278|292-en|en|wav/p292_418.wav|||It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.|
025279|292-en|en|wav/p292_419.wav|||But a surprise is in store.|
025280|292-en|en|wav/p292_420.wav|||You can cope with it.|
025281|292-en|en|wav/p292_421.wav|||He was back to square one.|
025282|292-en|en|wav/p292_422.wav|||We didn't get any from his face.|
025283|292-en|en|wav/p292_423.wav|||But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|
025284|292-en|en|wav/p292_424.wav|||It's time for a change.|
025285|293-en|en|wav/p293_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
025286|293-en|en|wav/p293_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
025287|293-en|en|wav/p293_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
025288|293-en|en|wav/p293_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
025289|293-en|en|wav/p293_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
025290|293-en|en|wav/p293_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
025291|293-en|en|wav/p293_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
025292|293-en|en|wav/p293_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
025293|293-en|en|wav/p293_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
025294|293-en|en|wav/p293_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
025295|293-en|en|wav/p293_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
025296|293-en|en|wav/p293_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
025297|293-en|en|wav/p293_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
025298|293-en|en|wav/p293_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
025299|293-en|en|wav/p293_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
025300|293-en|en|wav/p293_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
025301|293-en|en|wav/p293_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
025302|293-en|en|wav/p293_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
025303|293-en|en|wav/p293_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
025304|293-en|en|wav/p293_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
025305|293-en|en|wav/p293_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025306|293-en|en|wav/p293_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
025307|293-en|en|wav/p293_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
025308|293-en|en|wav/p293_025.wav|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|
025309|293-en|en|wav/p293_026.wav|||Theatre is not a museum.|
025310|293-en|en|wav/p293_027.wav|||It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|
025311|293-en|en|wav/p293_028.wav|||All my training is for Athens.|
025312|293-en|en|wav/p293_029.wav|||Subs not used, McCulloch.|
025313|293-en|en|wav/p293_030.wav|||I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|
025314|293-en|en|wav/p293_032.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
025315|293-en|en|wav/p293_033.wav|||Several others were absent.|
025316|293-en|en|wav/p293_034.wav|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
025317|293-en|en|wav/p293_035.wav|||There is a lot of heroin about.|
025318|293-en|en|wav/p293_036.wav|||There is a growing anger among the group.|
025319|293-en|en|wav/p293_037.wav|||I have got to adopt the same approach.|
025320|293-en|en|wav/p293_038.wav|||Seven people were later detained by police.|
025321|293-en|en|wav/p293_039.wav|||It's a sensible management decision.|
025322|293-en|en|wav/p293_040.wav|||Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|
025323|293-en|en|wav/p293_041.wav|||I would just like someone to confess.|
025324|293-en|en|wav/p293_042.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
025325|293-en|en|wav/p293_043.wav|||We can be proud of our achievements.|
025326|293-en|en|wav/p293_044.wav|||Clark is back on top form.|
025327|293-en|en|wav/p293_045.wav|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
025328|293-en|en|wav/p293_046.wav|||Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.|
025329|293-en|en|wav/p293_047.wav|||That was the theory, anyway.|
025330|293-en|en|wav/p293_048.wav|||Ferguson must take the blame.|
025331|293-en|en|wav/p293_049.wav|||This is thought to mean sometime next week.|
025332|293-en|en|wav/p293_050.wav|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
025333|293-en|en|wav/p293_051.wav|||Stealing from the benefits system is no different.|
025334|293-en|en|wav/p293_052.wav|||It is a large number.|
025335|293-en|en|wav/p293_053.wav|||We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|
025336|293-en|en|wav/p293_054.wav|||General, You didn't get a modified.|
025337|293-en|en|wav/p293_055.wav|||It does not even have a staff shortage.|
025338|293-en|en|wav/p293_056.wav|||That is our unfinished business.|
025339|293-en|en|wav/p293_057.wav|||This is far too high.|
025340|293-en|en|wav/p293_058.wav|||The Cabinet is split over the issue.|
025341|293-en|en|wav/p293_059.wav|||In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|
025342|293-en|en|wav/p293_060.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
025343|293-en|en|wav/p293_061.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
025344|293-en|en|wav/p293_062.wav|||So they will settle again.|
025345|293-en|en|wav/p293_063.wav|||He had other things on his mind.|
025346|293-en|en|wav/p293_064.wav|||Why did it take a concerted campaign?|
025347|293-en|en|wav/p293_065.wav|||Let us hope so.|
025348|293-en|en|wav/p293_066.wav|||It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.|
025349|293-en|en|wav/p293_067.wav|||A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.|
025350|293-en|en|wav/p293_068.wav|||It felt like my support system was leaving.|
025351|293-en|en|wav/p293_069.wav|||A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|
025352|293-en|en|wav/p293_070.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
025353|293-en|en|wav/p293_071.wav|||So the challenge is against ourselves.|
025354|293-en|en|wav/p293_072.wav|||You see, my back has gone.|
025355|293-en|en|wav/p293_073.wav|||It has been a lovely family occasion.|
025356|293-en|en|wav/p293_074.wav|||We've had our problems at the club.|
025357|293-en|en|wav/p293_075.wav|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
025358|293-en|en|wav/p293_076.wav|||More than half of the school collapsed.|
025359|293-en|en|wav/p293_077.wav|||We also hope to meet the men.|
025360|293-en|en|wav/p293_078.wav|||I can live with just the one.|
025361|293-en|en|wav/p293_079.wav|||All the people thought that we would die.|
025362|293-en|en|wav/p293_080.wav|||Sometimes they come off.|
025363|293-en|en|wav/p293_081.wav|||A teacher is, really, about unity.|
025364|293-en|en|wav/p293_082.wav|||Our nation has been changed by this event.|
025365|293-en|en|wav/p293_083.wav|||However, my position remains the same.|
025366|293-en|en|wav/p293_084.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
025367|293-en|en|wav/p293_085.wav|||There are plenty examples.|
025368|293-en|en|wav/p293_086.wav|||Self control is just one instalment.|
025369|293-en|en|wav/p293_087.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
025370|293-en|en|wav/p293_088.wav|||I could not believe what they were saying.|
025371|293-en|en|wav/p293_089.wav|||A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.|
025372|293-en|en|wav/p293_090.wav|||Will he be given time?|
025373|293-en|en|wav/p293_091.wav|||Beyond that would have been outrageous.|
025374|293-en|en|wav/p293_092.wav|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
025375|293-en|en|wav/p293_093.wav|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
025376|293-en|en|wav/p293_094.wav|||We've been overwhelmed by the response.|
025377|293-en|en|wav/p293_095.wav|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
025378|293-en|en|wav/p293_096.wav|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
025379|293-en|en|wav/p293_097.wav|||It has been hijacked.|
025380|293-en|en|wav/p293_098.wav|||And he's the first to see that, and say that.|
025381|293-en|en|wav/p293_099.wav|||They must put them back.|
025382|293-en|en|wav/p293_100.wav|||You do have a way out.|
025383|293-en|en|wav/p293_101.wav|||Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|
025384|293-en|en|wav/p293_102.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
025385|293-en|en|wav/p293_103.wav|||These guys are looking for business.|
025386|293-en|en|wav/p293_104.wav|||And, also, when he does not have the ball.|
025387|293-en|en|wav/p293_105.wav|||I have also been delighted with Stevie.|
025388|293-en|en|wav/p293_106.wav|||It was different in the endurance events.|
025389|293-en|en|wav/p293_107.wav|||They will now have to justify their position.|
025390|293-en|en|wav/p293_108.wav|||It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.|
025391|293-en|en|wav/p293_109.wav|||The objective was achieved.|
025392|293-en|en|wav/p293_110.wav|||So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.|
025393|293-en|en|wav/p293_111.wav|||Look at his last couple of records.|
025394|293-en|en|wav/p293_112.wav|||There is no musical background in his family.|
025395|293-en|en|wav/p293_113.wav|||The cost of war is more than that.|
025396|293-en|en|wav/p293_114.wav|||You, the British people, are the boss.|
025397|293-en|en|wav/p293_115.wav|||The door is open.|
025398|293-en|en|wav/p293_116.wav|||PR for Westminster is their holy grail.|
025399|293-en|en|wav/p293_117.wav|||She doesn't know me, know anything about me.|
025400|293-en|en|wav/p293_118.wav|||These are long-term investments.|
025401|293-en|en|wav/p293_119.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
025402|293-en|en|wav/p293_120.wav|||He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.|
025403|293-en|en|wav/p293_121.wav|||This is excellent news for Glasgow.|
025404|293-en|en|wav/p293_122.wav|||If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|
025405|293-en|en|wav/p293_123.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
025406|293-en|en|wav/p293_124.wav|||You ask the question.|
025407|293-en|en|wav/p293_125.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.|
025408|293-en|en|wav/p293_126.wav|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
025409|293-en|en|wav/p293_127.wav|||The Taliban response was swift.|
025410|293-en|en|wav/p293_128.wav|||Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.|
025411|293-en|en|wav/p293_129.wav|||In fact, they should have scored three times.|
025412|293-en|en|wav/p293_130.wav|||They have their own interests and techniques.|
025413|293-en|en|wav/p293_131.wav|||Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.|
025414|293-en|en|wav/p293_132.wav|||The firm was down and almost out.|
025415|293-en|en|wav/p293_133.wav|||Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.|
025416|293-en|en|wav/p293_134.wav|||Fifteen minutes later, they were found.|
025417|293-en|en|wav/p293_135.wav|||It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.|
025418|293-en|en|wav/p293_136.wav|||That is why we are here.|
025419|293-en|en|wav/p293_137.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
025420|293-en|en|wav/p293_138.wav|||Somehow they got out.|
025421|293-en|en|wav/p293_139.wav|||The house was so well alight.|
025422|293-en|en|wav/p293_140.wav|||I've been very nervous.|
025423|293-en|en|wav/p293_141.wav|||Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.|
025424|293-en|en|wav/p293_142.wav|||However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|
025425|293-en|en|wav/p293_143.wav|||The proposals were never taken seriously.|
025426|293-en|en|wav/p293_144.wav|||The Treasury denied the claims.|
025427|293-en|en|wav/p293_145.wav|||The same goes for McKenna.|
025428|293-en|en|wav/p293_146.wav|||Perhaps it should stay there.|
025429|293-en|en|wav/p293_147.wav|||You can be sure we will have problems.|
025430|293-en|en|wav/p293_148.wav|||Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|
025431|293-en|en|wav/p293_149.wav|||We had to take action to protect them.|
025432|293-en|en|wav/p293_150.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
025433|293-en|en|wav/p293_151.wav|||Our policy is clear.|
025434|293-en|en|wav/p293_152.wav|||I think we have a very strong case.|
025435|293-en|en|wav/p293_153.wav|||Who would be out there, singing?|
025436|293-en|en|wav/p293_154.wav|||It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|
025437|293-en|en|wav/p293_155.wav|||However, his remarks were heavily qualified.|
025438|293-en|en|wav/p293_156.wav|||It's something he has worked very hard on.|
025439|293-en|en|wav/p293_157.wav|||Horses have some sense.|
025440|293-en|en|wav/p293_158.wav|||Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.|
025441|293-en|en|wav/p293_159.wav|||Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|
025442|293-en|en|wav/p293_160.wav|||The only answer is a public inquiry.|
025443|293-en|en|wav/p293_161.wav|||Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|
025444|293-en|en|wav/p293_162.wav|||However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.|
025445|293-en|en|wav/p293_163.wav|||Politics is a tough game.|
025446|293-en|en|wav/p293_164.wav|||Darrell was, however, adamant.|
025447|293-en|en|wav/p293_165.wav|||The rear of the plane was on fire.|
025448|293-en|en|wav/p293_166.wav|||It is physical but it is also good.|
025449|293-en|en|wav/p293_167.wav|||It's unfair on her.|
025450|293-en|en|wav/p293_168.wav|||So, easy does it.|
025451|293-en|en|wav/p293_169.wav|||I just want to enjoy myself.|
025452|293-en|en|wav/p293_170.wav|||We are concerned that things should be safe.|
025453|293-en|en|wav/p293_171.wav|||At this point we can only speculate.|
025454|293-en|en|wav/p293_172.wav|||Family members are at her bedside.|
025455|293-en|en|wav/p293_173.wav|||I am very shocked.|
025456|293-en|en|wav/p293_174.wav|||The people here are quite reserved.|
025457|293-en|en|wav/p293_175.wav|||When will this change?|
025458|293-en|en|wav/p293_176.wav|||It has made me feel good.|
025459|293-en|en|wav/p293_177.wav|||It's been such a long haul.|
025460|293-en|en|wav/p293_178.wav|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
025461|293-en|en|wav/p293_179.wav|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
025462|293-en|en|wav/p293_180.wav|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
025463|293-en|en|wav/p293_181.wav|||However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.|
025464|293-en|en|wav/p293_182.wav|||Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|
025465|293-en|en|wav/p293_183.wav|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
025466|293-en|en|wav/p293_184.wav|||It was his job to check.|
025467|293-en|en|wav/p293_185.wav|||This is the stuff of live music.|
025468|293-en|en|wav/p293_186.wav|||Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.|
025469|293-en|en|wav/p293_187.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
025470|293-en|en|wav/p293_188.wav|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
025471|293-en|en|wav/p293_189.wav|||It's a huge amount.|
025472|293-en|en|wav/p293_190.wav|||The fire was falling from the sky.|
025473|293-en|en|wav/p293_191.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
025474|293-en|en|wav/p293_192.wav|||But he is something special, is he not?|
025475|293-en|en|wav/p293_193.wav|||This is simply unjust.|
025476|293-en|en|wav/p293_194.wav|||A final decision is expected by Friday.|
025477|293-en|en|wav/p293_195.wav|||We will do so again.|
025478|293-en|en|wav/p293_196.wav|||We will only move forward.|
025479|293-en|en|wav/p293_197.wav|||I'm a bit annoyed.|
025480|293-en|en|wav/p293_198.wav|||It ignores the future.|
025481|293-en|en|wav/p293_199.wav|||I am just looking to God.|
025482|293-en|en|wav/p293_200.wav|||I always savour the company of The Voice.|
025483|293-en|en|wav/p293_201.wav|||What's the rush?|
025484|293-en|en|wav/p293_202.wav|||It would also take time.|
025485|293-en|en|wav/p293_203.wav|||Nothing is ruled out.|
025486|293-en|en|wav/p293_204.wav|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
025487|293-en|en|wav/p293_205.wav|||He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.|
025488|293-en|en|wav/p293_206.wav|||I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|
025489|293-en|en|wav/p293_207.wav|||He was also married with two children.|
025490|293-en|en|wav/p293_208.wav|||His conclusion is upbeat.|
025491|293-en|en|wav/p293_209.wav|||Clearly, we could go on like this all day.|
025492|293-en|en|wav/p293_210.wav|||The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|
025493|293-en|en|wav/p293_211.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
025494|293-en|en|wav/p293_212.wav|||I'm just gonna hit the shot.|
025495|293-en|en|wav/p293_213.wav|||He will not be carrying out any surgery.|
025496|293-en|en|wav/p293_214.wav|||The replacements made a big difference.|
025497|293-en|en|wav/p293_215.wav|||We expect to come through on Thursday.|
025498|293-en|en|wav/p293_216.wav|||A web site's planned for November.|
025499|293-en|en|wav/p293_217.wav|||He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.|
025500|293-en|en|wav/p293_218.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
025501|293-en|en|wav/p293_219.wav|||He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|
025502|293-en|en|wav/p293_220.wav|||Who would be in that desert?|
025503|293-en|en|wav/p293_221.wav|||It will take some time to establish.|
025504|293-en|en|wav/p293_222.wav|||Sadly the jury were not convinced.|
025505|293-en|en|wav/p293_223.wav|||We never got off the bus.|
025506|293-en|en|wav/p293_224.wav|||I've had six days of rehearsal.|
025507|293-en|en|wav/p293_225.wav|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
025508|293-en|en|wav/p293_226.wav|||They have to come up with a solution.|
025509|293-en|en|wav/p293_227.wav|||The report will be launched in Glasgow today.|
025510|293-en|en|wav/p293_228.wav|||These will be finally corrected by next week.|
025511|293-en|en|wav/p293_229.wav|||They will form a tribute.|
025512|293-en|en|wav/p293_230.wav|||We had no idea that this letter existed.|
025513|293-en|en|wav/p293_231.wav|||I think in three dimensions.|
025514|293-en|en|wav/p293_232.wav|||Three others were wounded.|
025515|293-en|en|wav/p293_233.wav|||They had four children together.|
025516|293-en|en|wav/p293_234.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
025517|293-en|en|wav/p293_235.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
025518|293-en|en|wav/p293_236.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
025519|293-en|en|wav/p293_237.wav|||That was my own personal decision.|
025520|293-en|en|wav/p293_238.wav|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
025521|293-en|en|wav/p293_239.wav|||She returned home a few days later.|
025522|293-en|en|wav/p293_240.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
025523|293-en|en|wav/p293_241.wav|||So what's wrong with Scotland?|
025524|293-en|en|wav/p293_242.wav|||She had been in Germany for medical treatment.|
025525|293-en|en|wav/p293_243.wav|||How can they engage with the work?|
025526|293-en|en|wav/p293_244.wav|||It gave me something to focus on.|
025527|293-en|en|wav/p293_245.wav|||We live by the rule of law.|
025528|293-en|en|wav/p293_246.wav|||He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|
025529|293-en|en|wav/p293_247.wav|||She is fulfilled by it.|
025530|293-en|en|wav/p293_248.wav|||But one shouldn't go by that.|
025531|293-en|en|wav/p293_249.wav|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
025532|293-en|en|wav/p293_250.wav|||Advice and counselling will be offered.|
025533|293-en|en|wav/p293_251.wav|||Also, he was flawed.|
025534|293-en|en|wav/p293_252.wav|||That's why he plays for Scotland.|
025535|293-en|en|wav/p293_253.wav|||I just could not cope.|
025536|293-en|en|wav/p293_254.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
025537|293-en|en|wav/p293_255.wav|||In short, the club was broke.|
025538|293-en|en|wav/p293_256.wav|||The protest will go ahead as planned.|
025539|293-en|en|wav/p293_257.wav|||There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.|
025540|293-en|en|wav/p293_258.wav|||That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|
025541|293-en|en|wav/p293_259.wav|||I find the whole affair disturbing.|
025542|293-en|en|wav/p293_260.wav|||Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|
025543|293-en|en|wav/p293_261.wav|||Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.|
025544|293-en|en|wav/p293_262.wav|||The Commons is too outdated.|
025545|293-en|en|wav/p293_263.wav|||It feels like a privilege.|
025546|293-en|en|wav/p293_264.wav|||We have got a full house tonight.|
025547|293-en|en|wav/p293_265.wav|||It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|
025548|293-en|en|wav/p293_266.wav|||He will be advised by me.|
025549|293-en|en|wav/p293_267.wav|||It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.|
025550|293-en|en|wav/p293_268.wav|||Our children are our future.|
025551|293-en|en|wav/p293_269.wav|||It's part of your life.|
025552|293-en|en|wav/p293_270.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
025553|293-en|en|wav/p293_271.wav|||I was furious about it.|
025554|293-en|en|wav/p293_272.wav|||They were not doing it too well, either.|
025555|293-en|en|wav/p293_273.wav|||It is typical of me.|
025556|293-en|en|wav/p293_274.wav|||There are two offerings from Scotland.|
025557|293-en|en|wav/p293_275.wav|||Life becomes a song.|
025558|293-en|en|wav/p293_276.wav|||I know you went back this morning.|
025559|293-en|en|wav/p293_277.wav|||It has, however, been a long time coming.|
025560|293-en|en|wav/p293_278.wav|||This avalanche is just beginning.|
025561|293-en|en|wav/p293_279.wav|||That, however, is only part of their story.|
025562|293-en|en|wav/p293_280.wav|||Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.|
025563|293-en|en|wav/p293_281.wav|||I was living with my mum.|
025564|293-en|en|wav/p293_282.wav|||We very much regret that it has occurred.|
025565|293-en|en|wav/p293_283.wav|||The whole process was so different.|
025566|293-en|en|wav/p293_284.wav|||The BBC was a disgrace.|
025567|293-en|en|wav/p293_285.wav|||They feel it belongs to them.|
025568|293-en|en|wav/p293_286.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
025569|293-en|en|wav/p293_287.wav|||They certainly do not socialise.|
025570|293-en|en|wav/p293_288.wav|||Police have refused to name the couple involved.|
025571|293-en|en|wav/p293_289.wav|||They have got their position, we have got our position.|
025572|293-en|en|wav/p293_290.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
025573|293-en|en|wav/p293_291.wav|||He had played well in that central role.|
025574|293-en|en|wav/p293_292.wav|||We told them in June.|
025575|293-en|en|wav/p293_293.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
025576|293-en|en|wav/p293_294.wav|||They never gave up hope.|
025577|293-en|en|wav/p293_295.wav|||Construction is due to begin in February.|
025578|293-en|en|wav/p293_296.wav|||I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.|
025579|293-en|en|wav/p293_297.wav|||It was just another race, and yesterday is history.|
025580|293-en|en|wav/p293_298.wav|||The red card was okay.|
025581|293-en|en|wav/p293_300.wav|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
025582|293-en|en|wav/p293_301.wav|||But they will not be compelled to join.|
025583|293-en|en|wav/p293_302.wav|||It will vote with the US.|
025584|293-en|en|wav/p293_303.wav|||There will be no disruption to teaching.|
025585|293-en|en|wav/p293_304.wav|||Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|
025586|293-en|en|wav/p293_305.wav|||No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.|
025587|293-en|en|wav/p293_306.wav|||Again the verdict was not proven.|
025588|293-en|en|wav/p293_307.wav|||We've just got to work a bit better.|
025589|293-en|en|wav/p293_308.wav|||The likelihood is that it will be negative.|
025590|293-en|en|wav/p293_309.wav|||That suggests that out fitness is good.|
025591|293-en|en|wav/p293_310.wav|||But she's also beautiful behind the face.|
025592|293-en|en|wav/p293_311.wav|||Four had been brought down.|
025593|293-en|en|wav/p293_312.wav|||The British public is nothing if not fickle.|
025594|293-en|en|wav/p293_313.wav|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
025595|293-en|en|wav/p293_314.wav|||It is also claimed that he was murdered.|
025596|293-en|en|wav/p293_315.wav|||We will build upon the basic state pension.|
025597|293-en|en|wav/p293_316.wav|||Last year, however, was a different story.|
025598|293-en|en|wav/p293_317.wav|||I'm confident we can turn things around.|
025599|293-en|en|wav/p293_318.wav|||Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.|
025600|293-en|en|wav/p293_319.wav|||Frankly, they have to crack down.|

025605|293-en|en|wav/p293_324.wav|||I bought a car at auction.|
025606|293-en|en|wav/p293_325.wav|||You've gotten all the facts.|
025607|293-en|en|wav/p293_326.wav|||It possibly depends on the position.|
025608|293-en|en|wav/p293_327.wav|||Life is too short.|
025609|293-en|en|wav/p293_328.wav|||What is the Working Families Tax Credit?|

025614|293-en|en|wav/p293_333.wav|||SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.|
025615|293-en|en|wav/p293_334.wav|||For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|
025616|293-en|en|wav/p293_335.wav|||They had asked not to be named.|
025617|293-en|en|wav/p293_336.wav|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
025618|293-en|en|wav/p293_337.wav|||A whole range of factors are involved.|
025619|293-en|en|wav/p293_338.wav|||There may be some work in construction, but not enough.|
025620|293-en|en|wav/p293_339.wav|||They would love to do more films.|
025621|293-en|en|wav/p293_340.wav|||I have great sympathy with these people.|
025622|293-en|en|wav/p293_341.wav|||He wanted someone young and ambitious.|
025623|293-en|en|wav/p293_342.wav|||Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.|
025624|293-en|en|wav/p293_343.wav|||It raises a serious question mark.|
025625|293-en|en|wav/p293_344.wav|||He is dying from cancer.|
025626|293-en|en|wav/p293_345.wav|||The package has been properly costed.|
025627|293-en|en|wav/p293_346.wav|||The attitude and commitment was decent.|
025628|293-en|en|wav/p293_347.wav|||The feeling is awesome.|
025629|293-en|en|wav/p293_348.wav|||He quit in October.|
025630|293-en|en|wav/p293_349.wav|||The family also declined to discuss the case.|
025631|293-en|en|wav/p293_350.wav|||Famously, though, there was a catch.|
025632|293-en|en|wav/p293_351.wav|||Today, we begin to answer that question.|
025633|293-en|en|wav/p293_352.wav|||Barry will be able to handle this.|
025634|293-en|en|wav/p293_354.wav|||Failure is a curious concept.|
025635|293-en|en|wav/p293_355.wav|||But it can happen for Tiger.|
025636|293-en|en|wav/p293_356.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
025637|293-en|en|wav/p293_357.wav|||We're very excited and challenged by the project.|
025638|293-en|en|wav/p293_358.wav|||The science is well known, the solution is simple.|
025639|293-en|en|wav/p293_359.wav|||The initial reaction was disbelief.|
025640|293-en|en|wav/p293_360.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
025641|293-en|en|wav/p293_361.wav|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
025642|293-en|en|wav/p293_362.wav|||I now know that from memory.|
025643|293-en|en|wav/p293_363.wav|||She is believed to be in South Africa.|
025644|293-en|en|wav/p293_364.wav|||I felt we had fallen back a little.|
025645|293-en|en|wav/p293_365.wav|||He doesn't even know who he is.|
025646|293-en|en|wav/p293_366.wav|||This is our chance in Northern Ireland.|
025647|293-en|en|wav/p293_367.wav|||Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.|
025649|293-en|en|wav/p293_369.wav|||I don't know what we're doing wrong.|
025650|293-en|en|wav/p293_370.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
025651|293-en|en|wav/p293_371.wav|||It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.|
025652|293-en|en|wav/p293_372.wav|||His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|
025653|293-en|en|wav/p293_373.wav|||But it was to no avail.|
025654|293-en|en|wav/p293_374.wav|||I don't think the referees are against us.|
025655|293-en|en|wav/p293_375.wav|||The whole experience has left me bitter.|
025656|293-en|en|wav/p293_376.wav|||It is not a road of life.|
025657|293-en|en|wav/p293_377.wav|||This must be kept in total perspective.|
025658|293-en|en|wav/p293_378.wav|||It is three years at present.|
025659|293-en|en|wav/p293_379.wav|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
025660|293-en|en|wav/p293_380.wav|||As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.|
025661|293-en|en|wav/p293_381.wav|||When he took over it really took off.|
025662|293-en|en|wav/p293_382.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
025663|293-en|en|wav/p293_383.wav|||The penalty was the turning point.|
025664|293-en|en|wav/p293_384.wav|||I have chosen to do this research.|
025665|293-en|en|wav/p293_385.wav|||It was even worse than at home.|
025666|293-en|en|wav/p293_386.wav|||Michael's putting on a brave face.|
025667|293-en|en|wav/p293_387.wav|||This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|
025668|293-en|en|wav/p293_388.wav|||I am sure that this will happen again.|
025669|293-en|en|wav/p293_389.wav|||He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|
025670|293-en|en|wav/p293_390.wav|||All were within range of Israeli cities.|
025671|293-en|en|wav/p293_391.wav|||I do not believe they are.|
025672|293-en|en|wav/p293_392.wav|||The aircraft was totally destroyed.|
025673|293-en|en|wav/p293_393.wav|||What happens when the funding is exhausted.|
025674|293-en|en|wav/p293_394.wav|||She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|
025675|293-en|en|wav/p293_395.wav|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
025676|293-en|en|wav/p293_396.wav|||I should never have come over to Fife.|
025677|293-en|en|wav/p293_397.wav|||What kind of person is he?|
025678|293-en|en|wav/p293_398.wav|||Their bid was a very good one.|
025679|293-en|en|wav/p293_399.wav|||Green is desperate to play in The Open.|
025680|293-en|en|wav/p293_400.wav|||And this tournament will travel.|
025681|294-en|en|wav/p294_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
025682|294-en|en|wav/p294_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
025683|294-en|en|wav/p294_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
025684|294-en|en|wav/p294_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
025685|294-en|en|wav/p294_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
025686|294-en|en|wav/p294_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
025687|294-en|en|wav/p294_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
025688|294-en|en|wav/p294_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
025689|294-en|en|wav/p294_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
025690|294-en|en|wav/p294_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
025691|294-en|en|wav/p294_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
025692|294-en|en|wav/p294_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
025693|294-en|en|wav/p294_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
025694|294-en|en|wav/p294_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
025695|294-en|en|wav/p294_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
025696|294-en|en|wav/p294_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
025697|294-en|en|wav/p294_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
025698|294-en|en|wav/p294_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
025699|294-en|en|wav/p294_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
025700|294-en|en|wav/p294_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
025701|294-en|en|wav/p294_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
025702|294-en|en|wav/p294_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025704|294-en|en|wav/p294_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
025705|294-en|en|wav/p294_025.wav|||They were the better team on the night.|
025706|294-en|en|wav/p294_026.wav|||The show is sold out, like the others in the run.|
025707|294-en|en|wav/p294_027.wav|||It means we have to have some patience.|
025708|294-en|en|wav/p294_028.wav|||For the moment, our position remains the same.|
025709|294-en|en|wav/p294_029.wav|||I was pregnant and very worried.|
025710|294-en|en|wav/p294_030.wav|||He said she was mad.|
025711|294-en|en|wav/p294_031.wav|||They were impressive against France.|
025712|294-en|en|wav/p294_032.wav|||I am delighted at Murray's appointment.|
025713|294-en|en|wav/p294_033.wav|||The airport was even different.|
025714|294-en|en|wav/p294_034.wav|||Other people had looked at it.|
025715|294-en|en|wav/p294_035.wav|||A neighbour said the street was shocked.|
025716|294-en|en|wav/p294_036.wav|||Michael, he is running!|
025717|294-en|en|wav/p294_037.wav|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
025718|294-en|en|wav/p294_038.wav|||Their ambition is to go back.|
025719|294-en|en|wav/p294_039.wav|||He got the same story.|
025720|294-en|en|wav/p294_040.wav|||My view has now changed completely.|
025721|294-en|en|wav/p294_041.wav|||I've been dying for an hour.|
025722|294-en|en|wav/p294_042.wav|||It wasn't a flight of fancy.|
025723|294-en|en|wav/p294_043.wav|||We're playing away from home and that's it.|
025724|294-en|en|wav/p294_044.wav|||I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|
025725|294-en|en|wav/p294_045.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
025726|294-en|en|wav/p294_046.wav|||Who was the mystery MP?|
025727|294-en|en|wav/p294_047.wav|||This was no accident.|
025728|294-en|en|wav/p294_048.wav|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
025729|294-en|en|wav/p294_049.wav|||We've all done it!|
025730|294-en|en|wav/p294_050.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
025731|294-en|en|wav/p294_051.wav|||Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.|
025732|294-en|en|wav/p294_052.wav|||The course record was in his name.|
025733|294-en|en|wav/p294_053.wav|||But we welcome this document.|
025734|294-en|en|wav/p294_054.wav|||What is the point of jailing him?|
025735|294-en|en|wav/p294_055.wav|||We should not bring him into a dispute.|
025736|294-en|en|wav/p294_056.wav|||This is a possible way forward.|
025737|294-en|en|wav/p294_057.wav|||I am not here to get even.|
025738|294-en|en|wav/p294_058.wav|||Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.|
025739|294-en|en|wav/p294_059.wav|||We are only human.|
025740|294-en|en|wav/p294_060.wav|||I went with the mood.|
025741|294-en|en|wav/p294_061.wav|||I think we'll just keep it.|
025742|294-en|en|wav/p294_062.wav|||Debate is not just talk.|
025743|294-en|en|wav/p294_063.wav|||How is he enjoying life as a senior?|
025744|294-en|en|wav/p294_064.wav|||It is all about having physical evidence.|
025745|294-en|en|wav/p294_065.wav|||People remember the Tories in office.|
025746|294-en|en|wav/p294_066.wav|||What kind of inclusion is that?|
025747|294-en|en|wav/p294_067.wav|||I fell in love with it right away.|
025748|294-en|en|wav/p294_068.wav|||Domestic abuse is related to power and control.|
025749|294-en|en|wav/p294_069.wav|||It makes for an interesting conference.|
025750|294-en|en|wav/p294_070.wav|||I don't have any answer for them.|
025751|294-en|en|wav/p294_071.wav|||It took about five or six hours.|
025752|294-en|en|wav/p294_072.wav|||I found the course inspiring.|
025753|294-en|en|wav/p294_073.wav|||Two things were clear from the new programme.|
025754|294-en|en|wav/p294_074.wav|||This is the real thing now.|
025755|294-en|en|wav/p294_075.wav|||Until they came to do it.|
025756|294-en|en|wav/p294_076.wav|||She now lives in London.|
025757|294-en|en|wav/p294_077.wav|||It will not be a long campaign.|
025758|294-en|en|wav/p294_078.wav|||Subs not used, McGraw.|
025759|294-en|en|wav/p294_079.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
025760|294-en|en|wav/p294_080.wav|||One policeman was killed.|
025761|294-en|en|wav/p294_081.wav|||They could not have done more for me.|
025762|294-en|en|wav/p294_082.wav|||It was like a vacuum.|
025763|294-en|en|wav/p294_083.wav|||That was enough for the committee.|
025764|294-en|en|wav/p294_084.wav|||It is a very genuine prospect.|
025765|294-en|en|wav/p294_085.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
025766|294-en|en|wav/p294_086.wav|||We have to focus on what is important.|
025767|294-en|en|wav/p294_087.wav|||They have to work so hard.|
025768|294-en|en|wav/p294_088.wav|||It's not very pretty, but it's effective.|
025769|294-en|en|wav/p294_089.wav|||Seven British members of the club are missing.|
025770|294-en|en|wav/p294_090.wav|||He had just returned from a run.|
025771|294-en|en|wav/p294_091.wav|||There's a strong involvement.|
025772|294-en|en|wav/p294_092.wav|||Now, though, he has an incentive.|
025773|294-en|en|wav/p294_093.wav|||But now it's back to golf.|
025774|294-en|en|wav/p294_094.wav|||It should be a condition of employment.|
025775|294-en|en|wav/p294_095.wav|||Was it a signal?|
025776|294-en|en|wav/p294_096.wav|||It may not even be possible.|
025777|294-en|en|wav/p294_097.wav|||In fact, they go hand in hand.|
025778|294-en|en|wav/p294_098.wav|||I gave him a way out, and he took it.|
025779|294-en|en|wav/p294_099.wav|||So is that it, then?|
025780|294-en|en|wav/p294_100.wav|||You should have let it write the cards.|
025781|294-en|en|wav/p294_101.wav|||It's annoying in a way.|
025782|294-en|en|wav/p294_102.wav|||It's too close to call.|
025783|294-en|en|wav/p294_103.wav|||It's a long process.|
025784|294-en|en|wav/p294_104.wav|||I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|
025785|294-en|en|wav/p294_105.wav|||Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.|

025788|294-en|en|wav/p294_108.wav|||That's not part of the deal.|
025789|294-en|en|wav/p294_109.wav|||That was the context of his remarks.|
025790|294-en|en|wav/p294_110.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
025791|294-en|en|wav/p294_111.wav|||We have great confidence in Derek.|
025792|294-en|en|wav/p294_112.wav|||My ambition is to tell a good story.|
025793|294-en|en|wav/p294_113.wav|||I don't know the nature of the illness.|
025794|294-en|en|wav/p294_114.wav|||The industry will try to get round it.|
025795|294-en|en|wav/p294_115.wav|||Who will deliver more service to Scotland?|
025796|294-en|en|wav/p294_116.wav|||I want to make a vigorous defence.|
025797|294-en|en|wav/p294_117.wav|||And she got it.|
025798|294-en|en|wav/p294_118.wav|||We are the weakest link.|
025799|294-en|en|wav/p294_119.wav|||We have now no choice.|
025800|294-en|en|wav/p294_120.wav|||My father and mother are.|
025801|294-en|en|wav/p294_121.wav|||We don't know what happened after.|
025802|294-en|en|wav/p294_122.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
025803|294-en|en|wav/p294_123.wav|||He seems to be used to the attention.|
025804|294-en|en|wav/p294_124.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
025805|294-en|en|wav/p294_125.wav|||We have very real concerns about it.|
025806|294-en|en|wav/p294_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
025807|294-en|en|wav/p294_127.wav|||People will see this over time.|
025808|294-en|en|wav/p294_128.wav|||I can't speak for him.|
025809|294-en|en|wav/p294_129.wav|||They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|
025810|294-en|en|wav/p294_130.wav|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
025811|294-en|en|wav/p294_131.wav|||I can't see him reversing that.|
025812|294-en|en|wav/p294_132.wav|||I'm deeply sorry they did.|
025813|294-en|en|wav/p294_133.wav|||I can lead by example.|
025814|294-en|en|wav/p294_134.wav|||I have had a wonderful career.|
025815|294-en|en|wav/p294_135.wav|||It seemed to have direction.|
025816|294-en|en|wav/p294_136.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|
025817|294-en|en|wav/p294_137.wav|||It was different in the endurance events.|
025818|294-en|en|wav/p294_138.wav|||Above all, the approach is upbeat.|
025819|294-en|en|wav/p294_139.wav|||The objective was achieved.|

026031|294-en|en|wav/p294_352.wav|||They are not falling now.|
026032|294-en|en|wav/p294_353.wav|||They had to explain it.|
026033|294-en|en|wav/p294_354.wav|||We didn't mean to kill him.|
026034|294-en|en|wav/p294_355.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
026035|294-en|en|wav/p294_356.wav|||So far he has not done so.|
026036|294-en|en|wav/p294_357.wav|||He completely loses control.|
026037|294-en|en|wav/p294_358.wav|||No decision on that was taken.|
026038|294-en|en|wav/p294_359.wav|||My fitness was very poor.|
026039|294-en|en|wav/p294_360.wav|||The trial continues today.|
026040|294-en|en|wav/p294_361.wav|||People come to see the Highlands.|
026041|294-en|en|wav/p294_362.wav|||Europe is a bonus.|
026042|294-en|en|wav/p294_363.wav|||It is also used to buy coffins.|
026043|294-en|en|wav/p294_364.wav|||I've got to provide for my family.|
026044|294-en|en|wav/p294_365.wav|||Such debate is pointless.|
026045|294-en|en|wav/p294_366.wav|||And it had two seats.|
026046|294-en|en|wav/p294_367.wav|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
026047|294-en|en|wav/p294_368.wav|||He found it very hard to understand.|
026048|294-en|en|wav/p294_369.wav|||But it would change the context.|
026049|294-en|en|wav/p294_370.wav|||But who was driving it?|
026050|294-en|en|wav/p294_371.wav|||We recorded it at our own expense.|
026051|294-en|en|wav/p294_372.wav|||But opponents were quick to criticise.|
026052|294-en|en|wav/p294_373.wav|||Try to save us.|
026053|294-en|en|wav/p294_374.wav|||We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.|
026054|294-en|en|wav/p294_375.wav|||We need to increase the membership.|
026055|294-en|en|wav/p294_376.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
026056|294-en|en|wav/p294_377.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
026057|294-en|en|wav/p294_378.wav|||There could be a way back.|
026058|294-en|en|wav/p294_379.wav|||He edited the press release.|
026059|294-en|en|wav/p294_380.wav|||Visitors were also impressed.|
026060|294-en|en|wav/p294_381.wav|||It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.|
026061|294-en|en|wav/p294_382.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
026062|294-en|en|wav/p294_383.wav|||Are there muscular problems?|
026063|294-en|en|wav/p294_384.wav|||We had our chances.|
026064|294-en|en|wav/p294_385.wav|||However, many questions remained unanswered.|
026065|294-en|en|wav/p294_386.wav|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
026066|294-en|en|wav/p294_387.wav|||He is in the queue.|
026067|294-en|en|wav/p294_388.wav|||But what is?|
026068|294-en|en|wav/p294_389.wav|||It wasn't about her singing, though.|
026069|294-en|en|wav/p294_390.wav|||We have other options.|
026070|294-en|en|wav/p294_391.wav|||Calvin was back at his best today.|
026071|294-en|en|wav/p294_392.wav|||My mind was made up.|
026072|294-en|en|wav/p294_393.wav|||Nine days later, he suffered another attack.|
026073|294-en|en|wav/p294_394.wav|||And rugby fans can help.|
026074|294-en|en|wav/p294_395.wav|||The council's concern is very simple.|
026075|294-en|en|wav/p294_396.wav|||We are on the path of change.|
026076|294-en|en|wav/p294_397.wav|||Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.|
026077|294-en|en|wav/p294_398.wav|||No other vehicle was involved in the accident.|
026078|294-en|en|wav/p294_399.wav|||It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|
026079|294-en|en|wav/p294_400.wav|||Of course, it doesn't all come off.|
026080|294-en|en|wav/p294_401.wav|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
026081|294-en|en|wav/p294_402.wav|||He promised a final decision within a fortnight.|
026082|294-en|en|wav/p294_403.wav|||We will deal with the refugees.|
026083|294-en|en|wav/p294_404.wav|||The pair are no strangers to smashing records.|
026084|294-en|en|wav/p294_405.wav|||It's a tragedy for the area.|
026085|294-en|en|wav/p294_406.wav|||It was very well received.|
026086|294-en|en|wav/p294_407.wav|||I don't think there's going to be one.|
026087|294-en|en|wav/p294_408.wav|||If you could find it.|
026088|294-en|en|wav/p294_409.wav|||Such is the ego involved.|
026089|294-en|en|wav/p294_410.wav|||Mr Wilson has received no such request.|
026090|294-en|en|wav/p294_411.wav|||It raises the edge.|
026091|294-en|en|wav/p294_412.wav|||It was not known to myself.|
026092|294-en|en|wav/p294_413.wav|||It is a delight on every level.|
026093|294-en|en|wav/p294_414.wav|||Would it really be good to shorten it?|
026094|294-en|en|wav/p294_415.wav|||I don't entirely buy that.|
026095|294-en|en|wav/p294_416.wav|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
026096|294-en|en|wav/p294_417.wav|||I saw it in a different way.|
026097|294-en|en|wav/p294_418.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
026098|294-en|en|wav/p294_419.wav|||We have every respect for Michelle.|
026099|294-en|en|wav/p294_420.wav|||Mr Blunkett was convinced.|
026100|294-en|en|wav/p294_421.wav|||The auction will be held tomorrow.|
026101|294-en|en|wav/p294_422.wav|||It was really enjoyable on Saturday.|
026102|294-en|en|wav/p294_423.wav|||Athletics is on a roll in the country.|
026103|294-en|en|wav/p294_424.wav|||He died at the hands of his captors.|
026104|295-en|en|wav/p295_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
026105|295-en|en|wav/p295_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
026106|295-en|en|wav/p295_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
026107|295-en|en|wav/p295_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
026108|295-en|en|wav/p295_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
026109|295-en|en|wav/p295_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
026110|295-en|en|wav/p295_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026111|295-en|en|wav/p295_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026112|295-en|en|wav/p295_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026113|295-en|en|wav/p295_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026114|295-en|en|wav/p295_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026115|295-en|en|wav/p295_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
026116|295-en|en|wav/p295_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
026117|295-en|en|wav/p295_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
026118|295-en|en|wav/p295_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
026119|295-en|en|wav/p295_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
026120|295-en|en|wav/p295_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
026121|295-en|en|wav/p295_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026122|295-en|en|wav/p295_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
026123|295-en|en|wav/p295_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026124|295-en|en|wav/p295_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
026125|295-en|en|wav/p295_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
026126|295-en|en|wav/p295_025.wav|||It has never been worthwhile.|
026127|295-en|en|wav/p295_026.wav|||She was on the edge of breaking point.|
026128|295-en|en|wav/p295_027.wav|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
026129|295-en|en|wav/p295_028.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
026130|295-en|en|wav/p295_029.wav|||It has been supremely successful.|
026131|295-en|en|wav/p295_030.wav|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
026132|295-en|en|wav/p295_031.wav|||Which is where the manager comes in.|
026133|295-en|en|wav/p295_032.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
026134|295-en|en|wav/p295_033.wav|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
026135|295-en|en|wav/p295_034.wav|||We thought we would never see them again.|
026136|295-en|en|wav/p295_035.wav|||After that, it's a step into the unknown.|
026137|295-en|en|wav/p295_036.wav|||She asked me for the appointment with me.|
026138|295-en|en|wav/p295_037.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
026139|295-en|en|wav/p295_038.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
026140|295-en|en|wav/p295_039.wav|||I think he was nervous to begin with.|
026141|295-en|en|wav/p295_040.wav|||Our children are the future of our society.|
026142|295-en|en|wav/p295_041.wav|||I'm sure he would love it.|
026143|295-en|en|wav/p295_042.wav|||A final agreement has not yet been completed.|
026144|295-en|en|wav/p295_043.wav|||It's just not our biggest problem.|
026145|295-en|en|wav/p295_044.wav|||It is just like any other club.|
026146|295-en|en|wav/p295_045.wav|||Everything is possible in football.|
026147|295-en|en|wav/p295_046.wav|||I'm sure he didn't mean it.|
026148|295-en|en|wav/p295_048.wav|||We are going to New Broomfield to win.|
026149|295-en|en|wav/p295_049.wav|||Colin is free to speak with other teams.|
026150|295-en|en|wav/p295_050.wav|||He declined to give further details.|
026151|295-en|en|wav/p295_051.wav|||I think it was entirely the right decision.|
026152|295-en|en|wav/p295_052.wav|||Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|
026153|295-en|en|wav/p295_053.wav|||For sure we want to win it.|
026154|295-en|en|wav/p295_054.wav|||There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|
026155|295-en|en|wav/p295_055.wav|||Such debate is pointless.|
026156|295-en|en|wav/p295_056.wav|||He is helping police with their inquiries.|
026157|295-en|en|wav/p295_057.wav|||We recorded it at our own expense.|
026158|295-en|en|wav/p295_058.wav|||A formal decision will be announced within months.|
026159|295-en|en|wav/p295_059.wav|||I knew there was a challenge for me.|
026160|295-en|en|wav/p295_060.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
026161|295-en|en|wav/p295_061.wav|||I just have no maternal instincts.|
026162|295-en|en|wav/p295_062.wav|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
026163|295-en|en|wav/p295_063.wav|||They have a car and cannot afford another.|
026164|295-en|en|wav/p295_064.wav|||It is, after all, a very funny play.|
026165|295-en|en|wav/p295_065.wav|||Can you imagine a world without design?|
026166|295-en|en|wav/p295_066.wav|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
026167|295-en|en|wav/p295_067.wav|||And he listens to his artists as well.|
026168|295-en|en|wav/p295_068.wav|||I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.|
026169|295-en|en|wav/p295_069.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
026170|295-en|en|wav/p295_070.wav|||He's right up to a point.|
026171|295-en|en|wav/p295_071.wav|||We would have looked out for each other.|
026172|295-en|en|wav/p295_072.wav|||I had no choice but to leave.|
026173|295-en|en|wav/p295_073.wav|||Where does he go from here?|
026174|295-en|en|wav/p295_074.wav|||Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|
026175|295-en|en|wav/p295_075.wav|||This time, there were no such rewards.|
026176|295-en|en|wav/p295_076.wav|||But then they scored their fourth.|
026177|295-en|en|wav/p295_077.wav|||He said, My own position is quite simple.|
026178|295-en|en|wav/p295_078.wav|||But let's not get ahead of ourselves.|
026179|295-en|en|wav/p295_079.wav|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
026180|295-en|en|wav/p295_080.wav|||People are already enjoying it.|
026181|295-en|en|wav/p295_081.wav|||We're just delighted to be back on top.|
026182|295-en|en|wav/p295_082.wav|||Or is it the European approach?|
026183|295-en|en|wav/p295_083.wav|||I had found my vision.|
026184|295-en|en|wav/p295_084.wav|||Mr Wilson has received no such request.|
026185|295-en|en|wav/p295_085.wav|||However, we have not come to any conclusions.|
026186|295-en|en|wav/p295_086.wav|||There is a contract in existence for Allan.|
026187|295-en|en|wav/p295_087.wav|||I don't entirely buy that.|
026188|295-en|en|wav/p295_088.wav|||We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|
026189|295-en|en|wav/p295_089.wav|||It is giving out the wrong message.|
026190|295-en|en|wav/p295_090.wav|||It didn't come as any great surprise.|
026191|295-en|en|wav/p295_091.wav|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
026192|295-en|en|wav/p295_092.wav|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
026193|295-en|en|wav/p295_093.wav|||Nothing has changed from the season before.|
026194|295-en|en|wav/p295_094.wav|||I'm not thinking too much about the tour.|
026195|295-en|en|wav/p295_095.wav|||I had some time with Aston Villa.|
026196|295-en|en|wav/p295_096.wav|||We recognise it as a key area.|
026197|295-en|en|wav/p295_097.wav|||The mood was euphoric.|
026198|295-en|en|wav/p295_098.wav|||The time of judgment has arrived.|
026199|295-en|en|wav/p295_099.wav|||Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|
026200|295-en|en|wav/p295_100.wav|||You can take it almost anywhere and practise.|
026201|295-en|en|wav/p295_101.wav|||We want to be separate from our neighbours.|
026202|295-en|en|wav/p295_102.wav|||Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.|
026203|295-en|en|wav/p295_103.wav|||Have you heard anything from Paramount?|
026204|295-en|en|wav/p295_104.wav|||Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|
026205|295-en|en|wav/p295_105.wav|||Child abuse is a dreadful thing.|
026206|295-en|en|wav/p295_106.wav|||This has been a terrible experience.|
026207|295-en|en|wav/p295_107.wav|||He had a different agenda entirely.|
026208|295-en|en|wav/p295_108.wav|||Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.|
026209|295-en|en|wav/p295_109.wav|||We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|
026210|295-en|en|wav/p295_110.wav|||That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|
026211|295-en|en|wav/p295_111.wav|||She said she would not welcome the flowers.|
026212|295-en|en|wav/p295_112.wav|||It is reform in return for resources.|
026213|295-en|en|wav/p295_113.wav|||It offers a different viewpoint.|
026214|295-en|en|wav/p295_114.wav|||The band was good, and it's been a great day.|
026215|295-en|en|wav/p295_115.wav|||I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|
026216|295-en|en|wav/p295_116.wav|||I have no plans to retire.|
026217|295-en|en|wav/p295_117.wav|||The Scots are, however, in good company.|
026218|295-en|en|wav/p295_118.wav|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|
026219|295-en|en|wav/p295_119.wav|||There were far more pressing matters to consider.|
026220|295-en|en|wav/p295_120.wav|||The whole thing in general is moving on.|
026221|295-en|en|wav/p295_121.wav|||This is a test of our character.|
026222|295-en|en|wav/p295_122.wav|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
026223|295-en|en|wav/p295_123.wav|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
026224|295-en|en|wav/p295_124.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
026225|295-en|en|wav/p295_125.wav|||The look on his face was something special.|
026226|295-en|en|wav/p295_126.wav|||You have a very persuasive president.|
026227|295-en|en|wav/p295_127.wav|||Sure, we have problems.|
026228|295-en|en|wav/p295_128.wav|||We will provide immediate access.|

026436|295-en|en|wav/p295_339.wav|||However, that could alter following the latest case.|
026437|295-en|en|wav/p295_340.wav|||It's like a garage.|
026438|295-en|en|wav/p295_341.wav|||The last few weeks have been really bad.|

026441|295-en|en|wav/p295_344.wav|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
026442|295-en|en|wav/p295_345.wav|||Genetic assessment is crucial.|

026452|295-en|en|wav/p295_355.wav|||He is very much in our thoughts.|
026453|295-en|en|wav/p295_356.wav|||So what could be better than becoming captain?|
026454|295-en|en|wav/p295_357.wav|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|

026463|295-en|en|wav/p295_366.wav|||I decided not to renew the contract.|
026464|295-en|en|wav/p295_367.wav|||For us, that decision was hard to understand.|
026465|295-en|en|wav/p295_368.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
026466|295-en|en|wav/p295_369.wav|||There are so many artists working in Glasgow.|
026467|295-en|en|wav/p295_370.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|

026476|295-en|en|wav/p295_379.wav|||Surely the answer is yes.|
026477|295-en|en|wav/p295_380.wav|||It's part of your life.|
026478|295-en|en|wav/p295_381.wav|||I could go on, but none of these things is true.|
026479|295-en|en|wav/p295_382.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
026480|295-en|en|wav/p295_383.wav|||Our proposals are fully costed.|
026481|295-en|en|wav/p295_384.wav|||We all started running forward.|

026489|295-en|en|wav/p295_392.wav|||I have played really well all year.|
026490|295-en|en|wav/p295_393.wav|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
026491|295-en|en|wav/p295_394.wav|||It was visibly on fire.|
026492|295-en|en|wav/p295_395.wav|||It was a fiery game.|
026493|295-en|en|wav/p295_396.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
026494|295-en|en|wav/p295_397.wav|||That is European law.|
026495|295-en|en|wav/p295_398.wav|||It was very lucky no-one was killed.|

026507|295-en|en|wav/p295_410.wav|||To me, it was just a miracle.|
026508|295-en|en|wav/p295_411.wav|||After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|
026509|295-en|en|wav/p295_412.wav|||That can happen so easily.|
026510|295-en|en|wav/p295_413.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|

026512|295-en|en|wav/p295_415.wav|||Scotland needs to hear it, too.|
026513|295-en|en|wav/p295_416.wav|||There is too much at stake for that.|
026514|295-en|en|wav/p295_418.wav|||We suspect he was pleased.|
026515|295-en|en|wav/p295_419.wav|||Everything is surrounded by confusion.|
026516|295-en|en|wav/p295_420.wav|||But, of course, it isn't.|
026517|295-en|en|wav/p295_421.wav|||We are almost at that point, but not quite.|
026518|295-en|en|wav/p295_422.wav|||I have to say, for me, the game was not.|
026519|295-en|en|wav/p295_423.wav|||The document is a starting point for discussion.|

026525|297-en|en|wav/p297_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
026526|297-en|en|wav/p297_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
026527|297-en|en|wav/p297_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026528|297-en|en|wav/p297_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026529|297-en|en|wav/p297_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026530|297-en|en|wav/p297_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026531|297-en|en|wav/p297_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026532|297-en|en|wav/p297_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
026533|297-en|en|wav/p297_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
026534|297-en|en|wav/p297_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

026537|297-en|en|wav/p297_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
026538|297-en|en|wav/p297_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026539|297-en|en|wav/p297_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
026540|297-en|en|wav/p297_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026541|297-en|en|wav/p297_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
026543|297-en|en|wav/p297_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
026544|297-en|en|wav/p297_025.wav|||But it's been kept to a minimum.|

026563|297-en|en|wav/p297_044.wav|||Bombing is the easy option.|
026564|297-en|en|wav/p297_045.wav|||On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|
026565|297-en|en|wav/p297_046.wav|||Except for this, it was offside.|
026566|297-en|en|wav/p297_047.wav|||After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|
026567|297-en|en|wav/p297_048.wav|||What do we do for an encore?|
026568|297-en|en|wav/p297_049.wav|||Things start to talk to each other.|

026577|297-en|en|wav/p297_058.wav|||You just have to accept.|
026578|297-en|en|wav/p297_059.wav|||People will see this over time.|

026589|297-en|en|wav/p297_071.wav|||They can be time consuming.|
026590|297-en|en|wav/p297_072.wav|||It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.|

026943|298-en|en|wav/p298_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
026944|298-en|en|wav/p298_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026945|298-en|en|wav/p298_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

026955|298-en|en|wav/p298_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

026957|298-en|en|wav/p298_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026958|298-en|en|wav/p298_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

026960|298-en|en|wav/p298_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

027348|299-en|en|wav/p299_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
027349|299-en|en|wav/p299_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
027350|299-en|en|wav/p299_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
027351|299-en|en|wav/p299_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
027352|299-en|en|wav/p299_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
027353|299-en|en|wav/p299_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
027354|299-en|en|wav/p299_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
027355|299-en|en|wav/p299_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
027356|299-en|en|wav/p299_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
027357|299-en|en|wav/p299_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

027359|299-en|en|wav/p299_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
027360|299-en|en|wav/p299_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
027361|299-en|en|wav/p299_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
027362|299-en|en|wav/p299_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
027363|299-en|en|wav/p299_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
027364|299-en|en|wav/p299_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
027365|299-en|en|wav/p299_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
027366|299-en|en|wav/p299_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
027367|299-en|en|wav/p299_025.wav|||I just went for it over the weekend.|
027368|299-en|en|wav/p299_026.wav|||I managed to take her completely by surprise.|

027386|299-en|en|wav/p299_044.wav|||Today is not about contracts.|
027387|299-en|en|wav/p299_045.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
027388|299-en|en|wav/p299_046.wav|||That says something for his strength of character.|
027389|299-en|en|wav/p299_047.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
027390|299-en|en|wav/p299_048.wav|||It's to do with play.|

027394|299-en|en|wav/p299_052.wav|||That was the problem.|
027395|299-en|en|wav/p299_053.wav|||Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|
027396|299-en|en|wav/p299_054.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
027397|299-en|en|wav/p299_055.wav|||Everything else is second.|
027398|299-en|en|wav/p299_056.wav|||I think it is a sensible change.|
027399|299-en|en|wav/p299_057.wav|||Sex is fun?|

027414|299-en|en|wav/p299_072.wav|||We have reports of this throughout Scotland.|
027415|299-en|en|wav/p299_073.wav|||It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|
027416|299-en|en|wav/p299_074.wav|||The settlement could run to millions.|

028152|301-en|en|wav/p301_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
028153|301-en|en|wav/p301_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
028154|301-en|en|wav/p301_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
028155|301-en|en|wav/p301_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
028156|301-en|en|wav/p301_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
028157|301-en|en|wav/p301_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
028158|301-en|en|wav/p301_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
028159|301-en|en|wav/p301_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
028160|301-en|en|wav/p301_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

028163|301-en|en|wav/p301_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
028164|301-en|en|wav/p301_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
028165|301-en|en|wav/p301_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
028166|301-en|en|wav/p301_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
028167|301-en|en|wav/p301_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
028168|301-en|en|wav/p301_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
028169|301-en|en|wav/p301_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
028170|301-en|en|wav/p301_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
028171|301-en|en|wav/p301_025.wav|||But it was a great decision he joked.|

029244|304-en|en|wav/p304_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
029245|304-en|en|wav/p304_025.wav|||So we will cut their numbers.|
029246|304-en|en|wav/p304_026.wav|||Who cares about that?|
029247|304-en|en|wav/p304_027.wav|||Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.|

029250|304-en|en|wav/p304_030.wav|||The likelihood is that it will be negative.|
029251|304-en|en|wav/p304_031.wav|||In fact, we were all over the shop.|
029252|304-en|en|wav/p304_032.wav|||Scottish rugby has given me everything.|
029253|304-en|en|wav/p304_033.wav|||They agree to meet.|
029254|304-en|en|wav/p304_034.wav|||SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.|
029255|304-en|en|wav/p304_035.wav|||But there was a heavy price to pay.|
029256|304-en|en|wav/p304_036.wav|||The most important thing was to win today.|
029257|304-en|en|wav/p304_037.wav|||We have a strong team at the moment.|
029258|304-en|en|wav/p304_038.wav|||At half-time you have?|

029262|304-en|en|wav/p304_042.wav|||It was an ambush.|
029263|304-en|en|wav/p304_043.wav|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
029264|304-en|en|wav/p304_044.wav|||Scottish sport was not mentioned.|
029265|304-en|en|wav/p304_045.wav|||I was doing a charity concert.|
029266|304-en|en|wav/p304_046.wav|||You have to have a sense of humour.|
029267|304-en|en|wav/p304_047.wav|||It is not about changing our image.|
029268|304-en|en|wav/p304_048.wav|||We are waiting for advice on the film.|
029269|304-en|en|wav/p304_049.wav|||I hadn't been looking after myself.|

029275|304-en|en|wav/p304_055.wav|||I guess it is down to focus.|
029276|304-en|en|wav/p304_056.wav|||I'm very angry about it.|
029277|304-en|en|wav/p304_057.wav|||I have great respect for all my players.|

029279|304-en|en|wav/p304_059.wav|||For a moment it was all about her.|
029280|304-en|en|wav/p304_060.wav|||Sadly, the game will never see his like again.|
029281|304-en|en|wav/p304_061.wav|||Trading Places was too obvious.|
029282|304-en|en|wav/p304_062.wav|||They don't know how to do it.|
029283|304-en|en|wav/p304_063.wav|||No details were disclosed.|

029287|304-en|en|wav/p304_067.wav|||You probably have never seen them before.|
029288|304-en|en|wav/p304_068.wav|||Clearly, audiences are unsettled.|
029289|304-en|en|wav/p304_069.wav|||We have avoided that at least.|
029290|304-en|en|wav/p304_070.wav|||I love a clever reader.|
029291|304-en|en|wav/p304_071.wav|||I do not believe they are.|
029292|304-en|en|wav/p304_072.wav|||That is completely against Islam.|
029293|304-en|en|wav/p304_073.wav|||Clearly, there will have to be changes.|
029294|304-en|en|wav/p304_074.wav|||Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|
029295|304-en|en|wav/p304_075.wav|||I will wait until later.|
029296|304-en|en|wav/p304_076.wav|||But, of course, it isn't.|
029297|304-en|en|wav/p304_077.wav|||We are almost at that point, but not quite.|
029298|304-en|en|wav/p304_078.wav|||Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|
029299|304-en|en|wav/p304_079.wav|||Could it be?|
029300|304-en|en|wav/p304_080.wav|||It is bad news for us and England.|
029301|304-en|en|wav/p304_081.wav|||They had failed to explode.|
029302|304-en|en|wav/p304_082.wav|||We're all involved in deciding where it goes.|
029303|304-en|en|wav/p304_083.wav|||I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|
029304|304-en|en|wav/p304_084.wav|||Nor should there have been.|
029305|304-en|en|wav/p304_085.wav|||Smoking is also very important.|
029306|304-en|en|wav/p304_086.wav|||I have a theory.|

029309|304-en|en|wav/p304_089.wav|||My back is feeling really good.|
029310|304-en|en|wav/p304_090.wav|||They've got their own agenda.|
029311|304-en|en|wav/p304_091.wav|||This commitment should be built upon.|
029312|304-en|en|wav/p304_092.wav|||It was one he was born to play.|
029313|304-en|en|wav/p304_093.wav|||But we are losing that connection.|
029314|304-en|en|wav/p304_094.wav|||He was jailed for five years.|
029315|304-en|en|wav/p304_095.wav|||I am about protecting the state pension.|
029316|304-en|en|wav/p304_096.wav|||We will look into it.|
029317|304-en|en|wav/p304_097.wav|||But he's not afraid to take risks.|
029318|304-en|en|wav/p304_098.wav|||We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.|
029319|304-en|en|wav/p304_099.wav|||I live on the streets of Glasgow.|
029320|304-en|en|wav/p304_100.wav|||Did you get the script?|
029321|304-en|en|wav/p304_101.wav|||This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.|
029322|304-en|en|wav/p304_102.wav|||There, you were just a body.|
029323|304-en|en|wav/p304_103.wav|||He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.|
029324|304-en|en|wav/p304_104.wav|||Four people died instantly.|

029327|304-en|en|wav/p304_107.wav|||Our children are the future of our society.|
029328|304-en|en|wav/p304_108.wav|||Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.|
029329|304-en|en|wav/p304_109.wav|||I can't believe it's all gone.|
029330|304-en|en|wav/p304_110.wav|||I am just going to go for it.|
029331|304-en|en|wav/p304_111.wav|||We will meet again.|

029333|304-en|en|wav/p304_113.wav|||Part of the complex is historic.|
029334|304-en|en|wav/p304_114.wav|||We need to chat.|
029335|304-en|en|wav/p304_115.wav|||Justice was not seen today.|
029336|304-en|en|wav/p304_116.wav|||Among them are many criminals.|
029337|304-en|en|wav/p304_117.wav|||This is not about revenge.|
029338|304-en|en|wav/p304_118.wav|||How can we ignore it?|
029339|304-en|en|wav/p304_119.wav|||It's totally double standards.|
029340|304-en|en|wav/p304_120.wav|||Strikers like to go to the ground.|
029341|304-en|en|wav/p304_121.wav|||It's something he works hard at achieving.|
029342|304-en|en|wav/p304_122.wav|||We are taking the back seat on this.|
029343|304-en|en|wav/p304_123.wav|||It was a privilege to work for him.|
029344|304-en|en|wav/p304_124.wav|||But he admits he is deeply upset.|
029345|304-en|en|wav/p304_125.wav|||We told them in August.|
029346|304-en|en|wav/p304_126.wav|||We are going to have a parade.|
029347|304-en|en|wav/p304_127.wav|||That could be at least five years away.|
029348|304-en|en|wav/p304_128.wav|||That is my role.|
029349|304-en|en|wav/p304_129.wav|||Everyone can be bought.|
029350|304-en|en|wav/p304_130.wav|||You would be a fool not to listen.|
029351|304-en|en|wav/p304_131.wav|||No other offers apply.|
029352|304-en|en|wav/p304_132.wav|||Have you noticed?|
029353|304-en|en|wav/p304_133.wav|||This is a wonderful honour for me.|
029354|304-en|en|wav/p304_134.wav|||The Lobby is not failing.|
029355|304-en|en|wav/p304_135.wav|||It was a takeover.|
029356|304-en|en|wav/p304_136.wav|||That statement has never been withdrawn.|
029357|304-en|en|wav/p304_137.wav|||Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|
029358|304-en|en|wav/p304_138.wav|||How many cases have there been?|
029359|304-en|en|wav/p304_139.wav|||But we have to plan for the future.|
029360|304-en|en|wav/p304_140.wav|||And yet his legacy is doubtful.|
029361|304-en|en|wav/p304_141.wav|||This advice was accepted by ministers.|
029362|304-en|en|wav/p304_142.wav|||That's a pretty good percentage.|
029363|304-en|en|wav/p304_143.wav|||I feel very sad and extremely cut up.|
029364|304-en|en|wav/p304_144.wav|||I can't remember a lot about the accident.|
029365|304-en|en|wav/p304_145.wav|||You have to think not.|
029366|304-en|en|wav/p304_146.wav|||This is a total mystery.|
029367|304-en|en|wav/p304_147.wav|||They were due to have begun today.|
029368|304-en|en|wav/p304_148.wav|||Do not listen to them.|
029369|304-en|en|wav/p304_149.wav|||So what makes it so special?|
029370|304-en|en|wav/p304_150.wav|||It will be easier for us.|
029371|304-en|en|wav/p304_151.wav|||I'm pleased for him.|
029372|304-en|en|wav/p304_152.wav|||The report will be launched in Glasgow today.|
029373|304-en|en|wav/p304_153.wav|||You need a trademark.|
029374|304-en|en|wav/p304_154.wav|||This is our Olympics.|
029375|304-en|en|wav/p304_155.wav|||Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.|
029376|304-en|en|wav/p304_156.wav|||The tournament has now been cancelled.|
029377|304-en|en|wav/p304_157.wav|||My goal was very important to the team.|
029378|304-en|en|wav/p304_158.wav|||There are plenty examples.|
029379|304-en|en|wav/p304_159.wav|||This is not a Scottish problem.|
029380|304-en|en|wav/p304_160.wav|||They do not work for Glasgow City Council.|
029381|304-en|en|wav/p304_161.wav|||I have worked with him on projects.|
029382|304-en|en|wav/p304_162.wav|||It may be that lifestyle is behind it.|
029383|304-en|en|wav/p304_163.wav|||It was nice to get a clean sheet.|
029384|304-en|en|wav/p304_164.wav|||And there is no cause for it.|
029385|304-en|en|wav/p304_165.wav|||I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.|
029386|304-en|en|wav/p304_166.wav|||What has changed?|
029387|304-en|en|wav/p304_167.wav|||Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.|
029388|304-en|en|wav/p304_168.wav|||It is a symbolic concert.|
029389|304-en|en|wav/p304_169.wav|||He asked me how they were doing.|
029390|304-en|en|wav/p304_170.wav|||They would have looked out for each other.|
029391|304-en|en|wav/p304_171.wav|||I've got three other ideas for the day.|
029392|304-en|en|wav/p304_172.wav|||Well it had to be something, that's for sure.|
029393|304-en|en|wav/p304_174.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
029394|304-en|en|wav/p304_175.wav|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
029395|304-en|en|wav/p304_176.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
029396|304-en|en|wav/p304_177.wav|||Nelson does not disappoint.|
029397|304-en|en|wav/p304_178.wav|||Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|
029398|304-en|en|wav/p304_179.wav|||The real world is full of competing causes.|
029399|304-en|en|wav/p304_180.wav|||They've got to decide to do that.|
029400|304-en|en|wav/p304_181.wav|||Strathclyde Police declined to comment.|
029401|304-en|en|wav/p304_182.wav|||These are terrible offences.|
029402|304-en|en|wav/p304_183.wav|||This is it finally finished.|
029403|304-en|en|wav/p304_184.wav|||An announcement is expected today on their future.|
029404|304-en|en|wav/p304_185.wav|||There were so many characters among them.|
029405|304-en|en|wav/p304_186.wav|||Or is it the European approach?|
029406|304-en|en|wav/p304_187.wav|||We could not get any possession.|
029407|304-en|en|wav/p304_188.wav|||Did you see that?|
029408|304-en|en|wav/p304_189.wav|||The cost of war is more than that.|
029409|304-en|en|wav/p304_190.wav|||I saw the whole thing.|
029410|304-en|en|wav/p304_191.wav|||There is a demand for another hospice.|
029411|304-en|en|wav/p304_192.wav|||There is a contract in existence for Allan.|
029412|304-en|en|wav/p304_193.wav|||Then they were awarded a penalty.|
029413|304-en|en|wav/p304_194.wav|||Journalists should make him.|
029414|304-en|en|wav/p304_195.wav|||They will have five minutes to decide.|
029415|304-en|en|wav/p304_196.wav|||I see that any day now.|
029416|304-en|en|wav/p304_197.wav|||But who knows?|
029417|304-en|en|wav/p304_198.wav|||He was tough and relentless.|
029418|304-en|en|wav/p304_199.wav|||That would be unlawful.|
029419|304-en|en|wav/p304_200.wav|||This guy is amazing.|
029420|304-en|en|wav/p304_201.wav|||The same goes for McKenna.|
029421|304-en|en|wav/p304_202.wav|||That is no use.|
029422|304-en|en|wav/p304_203.wav|||They will want to perform well.|
029423|304-en|en|wav/p304_204.wav|||We should not worry about other players.|
029424|304-en|en|wav/p304_205.wav|||Ownership was the game.|
029425|304-en|en|wav/p304_206.wav|||Their moment had come, or so they said.|
029426|304-en|en|wav/p304_207.wav|||I love the moment of being first.|
029427|304-en|en|wav/p304_208.wav|||Some examples are presented in detail.|
029428|304-en|en|wav/p304_209.wav|||You cannot understand it until you experience it.|
029429|304-en|en|wav/p304_210.wav|||Anything that can be done, the Government will do.|
029430|304-en|en|wav/p304_211.wav|||I sincerely hope that will not change.|
029431|304-en|en|wav/p304_212.wav|||Just don't go looking to be shocked.|
029432|304-en|en|wav/p304_213.wav|||It was total confusion.|
029433|304-en|en|wav/p304_214.wav|||I have learned from him.|
029434|304-en|en|wav/p304_215.wav|||Pupils will be the losers.|
029435|304-en|en|wav/p304_216.wav|||The position on the euro remains unchanged.|
029436|304-en|en|wav/p304_217.wav|||Such actions are rarely popular.|
029437|304-en|en|wav/p304_218.wav|||That is why it is so lyrical.|
029438|304-en|en|wav/p304_219.wav|||It isn't a happy memory.|
029439|304-en|en|wav/p304_220.wav|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
029440|304-en|en|wav/p304_221.wav|||Who would be a referee?|
029441|304-en|en|wav/p304_222.wav|||We have a team to reach the final.|
029442|304-en|en|wav/p304_223.wav|||We want to be separate from our neighbours.|
029443|304-en|en|wav/p304_224.wav|||He was correct in everything he did.|
029444|304-en|en|wav/p304_225.wav|||I see no reason for them to be.|
029445|304-en|en|wav/p304_226.wav|||I never agreed with that.|
029446|304-en|en|wav/p304_227.wav|||He was dead on arrival at the hospital.|
029447|304-en|en|wav/p304_228.wav|||I don't think it is vital.|
029448|304-en|en|wav/p304_229.wav|||But he insisted that victory was possible.|
029449|304-en|en|wav/p304_230.wav|||That could run into millions.|
029450|304-en|en|wav/p304_231.wav|||It might not survive the process.|
029451|304-en|en|wav/p304_232.wav|||The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.|
029452|304-en|en|wav/p304_233.wav|||I'm really excited about the album.|
029453|304-en|en|wav/p304_234.wav|||We were desperate to get the game on.|
029454|304-en|en|wav/p304_235.wav|||But there is a possible place.|
029455|304-en|en|wav/p304_236.wav|||You can't have it both ways.|
029456|304-en|en|wav/p304_237.wav|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
029457|304-en|en|wav/p304_238.wav|||But they will need to play to score.|
029458|304-en|en|wav/p304_239.wav|||He is a joy to watch.|
029459|304-en|en|wav/p304_240.wav|||They also have good neighbours.|
029460|304-en|en|wav/p304_241.wav|||We are now open.|
029461|304-en|en|wav/p304_242.wav|||She said she would not welcome the flowers.|
029462|304-en|en|wav/p304_243.wav|||There is no pressure from anyone now.|
029463|304-en|en|wav/p304_244.wav|||Now it has become a big picture.|
029464|304-en|en|wav/p304_245.wav|||We want to learn lessons from that.|
029465|304-en|en|wav/p304_246.wav|||He can perform well under pressure.|
029466|304-en|en|wav/p304_247.wav|||I've enjoyed the whole experience.|
029467|304-en|en|wav/p304_248.wav|||He was totally without that form of fear.|
029468|304-en|en|wav/p304_249.wav|||The band was good, and it's been a great day.|
029469|304-en|en|wav/p304_250.wav|||ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|
029470|304-en|en|wav/p304_251.wav|||They have the cash to do that.|
029471|304-en|en|wav/p304_252.wav|||This is a defining moment in this parliament.|
029472|304-en|en|wav/p304_253.wav|||He wouldn't have played in all three.|
029473|304-en|en|wav/p304_254.wav|||And that includes the Barnett formula.|
029474|304-en|en|wav/p304_255.wav|||It is a great shame.|
029475|304-en|en|wav/p304_256.wav|||But experts have disputed that statistic.|
029476|304-en|en|wav/p304_257.wav|||The council has been open and transparent.|
029477|304-en|en|wav/p304_258.wav|||I'll never think of myself as a star.|
029478|304-en|en|wav/p304_259.wav|||I felt he was excellent.|
029479|304-en|en|wav/p304_260.wav|||It was a policy they were against.|
029480|304-en|en|wav/p304_261.wav|||The results are sometimes contentious.|
029481|304-en|en|wav/p304_262.wav|||I believe that Scotland has much to gain.|
029482|304-en|en|wav/p304_263.wav|||People have been wonderful beyond belief.|
029483|304-en|en|wav/p304_264.wav|||Had she enjoyed the experience?|
029484|304-en|en|wav/p304_265.wav|||He has changed the country itself.|
029485|304-en|en|wav/p304_266.wav|||The look on his face was something special.|
029486|304-en|en|wav/p304_267.wav|||I can certainly see much better.|
029487|304-en|en|wav/p304_268.wav|||We then went to see the headmaster.|
029488|304-en|en|wav/p304_269.wav|||I needed a little man in the crowd.|
029489|304-en|en|wav/p304_270.wav|||It would then be up to the judge.|
029490|304-en|en|wav/p304_271.wav|||Are we going to stay up?|
029491|304-en|en|wav/p304_272.wav|||People were actually not on his side.|
029492|304-en|en|wav/p304_273.wav|||It was a very difficult period.|
029493|304-en|en|wav/p304_274.wav|||It's all going to clear the debt.|
029494|304-en|en|wav/p304_275.wav|||It used to be less than five minutes.|
029495|304-en|en|wav/p304_276.wav|||It was by the numbers.|
029496|304-en|en|wav/p304_277.wav|||My Dad is a hero.|
029497|304-en|en|wav/p304_278.wav|||It is my fault.|
029498|304-en|en|wav/p304_279.wav|||We are not asking for the moon.|
029499|304-en|en|wav/p304_280.wav|||That used to be another thing of mine.|
029500|304-en|en|wav/p304_281.wav|||At the election we will oppose the euro.|
029501|304-en|en|wav/p304_282.wav|||As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.|
029502|304-en|en|wav/p304_283.wav|||Teachers have been given the offer.|
029503|304-en|en|wav/p304_284.wav|||He called for a public inquiry.|
029504|304-en|en|wav/p304_285.wav|||I haven't had a lesson in four years.|
029505|304-en|en|wav/p304_286.wav|||I played badly, but it happens.|
029506|304-en|en|wav/p304_287.wav|||I have got a wife to feed.|
029507|304-en|en|wav/p304_288.wav|||I lost my head.|
029508|304-en|en|wav/p304_289.wav|||What are the barriers?|
029509|304-en|en|wav/p304_290.wav|||He is keen to stay in public service.|
029510|304-en|en|wav/p304_291.wav|||You are not going in blind.|
029511|304-en|en|wav/p304_292.wav|||You had to go and see him.|
029512|304-en|en|wav/p304_293.wav|||She says she has grown up.|
029513|304-en|en|wav/p304_294.wav|||He met his wife and married in England.|
029514|304-en|en|wav/p304_295.wav|||But it could have been written for her.|
029515|304-en|en|wav/p304_296.wav|||It makes no sense.|
029516|304-en|en|wav/p304_297.wav|||What will they called?|
029517|304-en|en|wav/p304_298.wav|||We come here in peace, for peace.|
029518|304-en|en|wav/p304_299.wav|||He will feel the pain again.|
029519|304-en|en|wav/p304_300.wav|||After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.|
029520|304-en|en|wav/p304_301.wav|||I can't stand this sort of stuff.|
029521|304-en|en|wav/p304_302.wav|||Is Saddam a threat?|
029522|304-en|en|wav/p304_303.wav|||The jury is still out.|
029523|304-en|en|wav/p304_304.wav|||Hopefully, they will not go through with it.|
029524|304-en|en|wav/p304_305.wav|||I can't say that this is very usual.|
029525|304-en|en|wav/p304_306.wav|||He is married, with two children.|
029526|304-en|en|wav/p304_307.wav|||At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.|
029527|304-en|en|wav/p304_308.wav|||We are the gateway to justice.|
029528|304-en|en|wav/p304_309.wav|||As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.|
029529|304-en|en|wav/p304_310.wav|||We understand the changes in the world.|
029530|304-en|en|wav/p304_311.wav|||It is a potential factor.|
029531|304-en|en|wav/p304_312.wav|||The working families tax credit is far better.|
029532|304-en|en|wav/p304_313.wav|||It added to the reverence.|
029533|304-en|en|wav/p304_314.wav|||It is too early to say.|
029534|304-en|en|wav/p304_315.wav|||It's to do with context.|
029535|304-en|en|wav/p304_316.wav|||David Trimble has sold out.|
029536|304-en|en|wav/p304_317.wav|||Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|
029537|304-en|en|wav/p304_318.wav|||I don't understand it.|
029538|304-en|en|wav/p304_319.wav|||The teenager had been missing for six months.|
029539|304-en|en|wav/p304_320.wav|||He was rejected because he had retired.|
029540|304-en|en|wav/p304_321.wav|||And then we got off the plane.|
029541|304-en|en|wav/p304_322.wav|||I think it is wide open.|
029542|304-en|en|wav/p304_323.wav|||I am totally surprised.|
029543|304-en|en|wav/p304_324.wav|||We are all ecstatic.|
029544|304-en|en|wav/p304_325.wav|||I hope he has learned from it.|
029545|304-en|en|wav/p304_326.wav|||That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.|
029546|304-en|en|wav/p304_327.wav|||You are a gambling man.|
029547|304-en|en|wav/p304_328.wav|||Who honestly expected anything else?|
029548|304-en|en|wav/p304_329.wav|||The search has been called off.|
029549|304-en|en|wav/p304_330.wav|||The matter will come up again.|
029550|304-en|en|wav/p304_331.wav|||Our strategy is straightforward.|
029551|304-en|en|wav/p304_332.wav|||Surely this is not supposed to happen?|
029552|304-en|en|wav/p304_333.wav|||We must recognise that this outfit is unique.|
029553|304-en|en|wav/p304_334.wav|||They were unable to revive him.|
029554|304-en|en|wav/p304_335.wav|||This has come as a shock to everyone.|
029555|304-en|en|wav/p304_336.wav|||Yes, it was too short a night.|
029556|304-en|en|wav/p304_337.wav|||It is not for me, though.|
029557|304-en|en|wav/p304_338.wav|||It really was my favourite.|
029558|304-en|en|wav/p304_339.wav|||That is why this action has been taken.|
029559|304-en|en|wav/p304_340.wav|||They should be looking at his victims.|
029560|304-en|en|wav/p304_341.wav|||There were many positives for this club.|
029561|304-en|en|wav/p304_342.wav|||It's all about money, money, money.|
029562|304-en|en|wav/p304_343.wav|||There wasn't anything in it.|
029563|304-en|en|wav/p304_344.wav|||What do we do for an encore?|
029564|304-en|en|wav/p304_345.wav|||Things start to talk to each other.|
029565|304-en|en|wav/p304_346.wav|||I would like to stay with Rangers.|
029566|304-en|en|wav/p304_347.wav|||Saddam Hussein is a devil.|
029567|304-en|en|wav/p304_348.wav|||Thirty people have applied for his job!|
029568|304-en|en|wav/p304_349.wav|||That is a lot of writing.|
029569|304-en|en|wav/p304_350.wav|||There is no excuse for domestic abuse.|
029570|304-en|en|wav/p304_351.wav|||It is no place for a poet.|
029571|304-en|en|wav/p304_352.wav|||There is room for me.|
029572|304-en|en|wav/p304_353.wav|||My life is in the ballet.|
029573|304-en|en|wav/p304_354.wav|||For next season, we have time to restructure.|
029574|304-en|en|wav/p304_355.wav|||The truth, of course, is very different.|
029575|304-en|en|wav/p304_356.wav|||He has something in common with the Wallabies.|
029576|304-en|en|wav/p304_357.wav|||These will take a little time to develop.|
029577|304-en|en|wav/p304_358.wav|||This is not a birthday party.|
029578|304-en|en|wav/p304_359.wav|||Darren is very, very good.|
029579|304-en|en|wav/p304_360.wav|||It's a drop in the bucket.|
029580|304-en|en|wav/p304_361.wav|||I've had a hard time, to be honest.|
029581|304-en|en|wav/p304_362.wav|||I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|
029582|304-en|en|wav/p304_363.wav|||She is still very poorly.|
029583|304-en|en|wav/p304_364.wav|||That's how she wants to remember him.|
029584|304-en|en|wav/p304_365.wav|||There was no disruption to services.|
029585|304-en|en|wav/p304_366.wav|||We talk about effective military action.|
029586|304-en|en|wav/p304_367.wav|||It was a discussion paper.|
029587|304-en|en|wav/p304_368.wav|||My neighbours are horrified.|
029588|304-en|en|wav/p304_369.wav|||He had no problem with alcohol.|
029589|304-en|en|wav/p304_370.wav|||This was a very tragic accident.|
029590|304-en|en|wav/p304_371.wav|||If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.|
029591|304-en|en|wav/p304_372.wav|||It is the voice of the survivors.|
029592|304-en|en|wav/p304_373.wav|||I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.|
029593|304-en|en|wav/p304_374.wav|||I wish him well.|
029594|304-en|en|wav/p304_375.wav|||Only the details have to be sorted out.|
029595|304-en|en|wav/p304_376.wav|||They say they feel different.|
029596|304-en|en|wav/p304_377.wav|||We are in the hat.|
029597|304-en|en|wav/p304_378.wav|||Well, what can you do?|
029598|304-en|en|wav/p304_379.wav|||Motorists will welcome this.|
029599|304-en|en|wav/p304_380.wav|||It is not the message alone.|
029600|304-en|en|wav/p304_381.wav|||She failed to win any of them.|
029601|304-en|en|wav/p304_382.wav|||He is at war with his knee.|
029602|304-en|en|wav/p304_383.wav|||I think we're going to make it.|
029603|304-en|en|wav/p304_384.wav|||I didn't know where they were.|
029604|304-en|en|wav/p304_385.wav|||Clubs can only do so much.|
029605|304-en|en|wav/p304_386.wav|||Many other areas are coming up.|
029606|304-en|en|wav/p304_387.wav|||But it's a subtle process.|
029607|304-en|en|wav/p304_388.wav|||But let's not go down that road.|
029608|304-en|en|wav/p304_389.wav|||It is not attempting to offer a solution.|
029609|304-en|en|wav/p304_390.wav|||Changes need to be made.|
029610|304-en|en|wav/p304_391.wav|||I don't care to recall it.|
029611|304-en|en|wav/p304_392.wav|||That's the way things are heading.|
029612|304-en|en|wav/p304_393.wav|||Hard it will be.|
029613|304-en|en|wav/p304_394.wav|||He just attracted people.|
029614|304-en|en|wav/p304_395.wav|||It was better than a soap opera.|
029615|304-en|en|wav/p304_396.wav|||I doubt it would be genuine.|
029616|304-en|en|wav/p304_397.wav|||You must be ready to play anyone.|
029617|304-en|en|wav/p304_398.wav|||It would have been a very explosive issue.|
029618|304-en|en|wav/p304_399.wav|||It seems a waste of talents.|
029619|304-en|en|wav/p304_400.wav|||It is the worst of both worlds.|
029620|304-en|en|wav/p304_401.wav|||We need to tighten up.|
029621|304-en|en|wav/p304_402.wav|||His body was never found.|
029622|304-en|en|wav/p304_403.wav|||Just get on with your job.|
029623|304-en|en|wav/p304_404.wav|||We expect a full house on the night.|
029624|304-en|en|wav/p304_405.wav|||He said it was his greatest work.|
029625|304-en|en|wav/p304_406.wav|||The baby deserves the credit.|
029626|304-en|en|wav/p304_407.wav|||They are different types.|
029627|304-en|en|wav/p304_408.wav|||Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.|
029628|304-en|en|wav/p304_409.wav|||We are not too surprised.|
029629|304-en|en|wav/p304_410.wav|||They are not a set of options.|
029630|304-en|en|wav/p304_411.wav|||But it was money well spent.|
029631|304-en|en|wav/p304_412.wav|||They would never let him go.|
029632|304-en|en|wav/p304_413.wav|||Which is worse?|
029633|304-en|en|wav/p304_414.wav|||At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|
029634|304-en|en|wav/p304_415.wav|||Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.|
029635|304-en|en|wav/p304_416.wav|||He took over our lives.|
029636|304-en|en|wav/p304_417.wav|||I would think they are just behind them.|
029637|304-en|en|wav/p304_418.wav|||We would all have liked to run.|
029638|304-en|en|wav/p304_419.wav|||I can understand why they have gone.|
029639|304-en|en|wav/p304_420.wav|||That, though, was then.|
029640|304-en|en|wav/p304_421.wav|||People should not become complacent.|
029641|304-en|en|wav/p304_422.wav|||I will go out with him any time.|
029642|304-en|en|wav/p304_423.wav|||I would have the hammer in the crowd.|
029643|304-en|en|wav/p304_424.wav|||Public safety is paramount.|
029644|305-en|en|wav/p305_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
029645|305-en|en|wav/p305_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
029646|305-en|en|wav/p305_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
029647|305-en|en|wav/p305_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
029648|305-en|en|wav/p305_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
029649|305-en|en|wav/p305_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
029650|305-en|en|wav/p305_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
029651|305-en|en|wav/p305_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
029652|305-en|en|wav/p305_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
029653|305-en|en|wav/p305_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
029654|305-en|en|wav/p305_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

029880|305-en|en|wav/p305_237.wav|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
029881|305-en|en|wav/p305_238.wav|||Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.|
029882|305-en|en|wav/p305_239.wav|||So the process was refined.|
029883|305-en|en|wav/p305_240.wav|||I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|
029884|305-en|en|wav/p305_241.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|

030842|308-en|en|wav/p308_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
030843|308-en|en|wav/p308_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
030844|308-en|en|wav/p308_008.wav|||They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

030846|308-en|en|wav/p308_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
030847|308-en|en|wav/p308_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
030848|308-en|en|wav/p308_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
030849|308-en|en|wav/p308_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

030853|308-en|en|wav/p308_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
030854|308-en|en|wav/p308_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
030855|308-en|en|wav/p308_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
030856|308-en|en|wav/p308_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
030857|308-en|en|wav/p308_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
030858|308-en|en|wav/p308_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.|

031265|310-en|en|wav/p310_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031266|310-en|en|wav/p310_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
031267|310-en|en|wav/p310_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
031268|310-en|en|wav/p310_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
031269|310-en|en|wav/p310_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
031270|310-en|en|wav/p310_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
031271|310-en|en|wav/p310_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
031272|310-en|en|wav/p310_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|

031276|310-en|en|wav/p310_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
031277|310-en|en|wav/p310_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
031278|310-en|en|wav/p310_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
031279|310-en|en|wav/p310_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031280|310-en|en|wav/p310_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031281|310-en|en|wav/p310_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|

031298|310-en|en|wav/p310_039.wav|||But one shouldn't go by that.|
031299|310-en|en|wav/p310_040.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
031300|310-en|en|wav/p310_041.wav|||Buying our way out is not an option.|

031305|310-en|en|wav/p310_046.wav|||And who would argue with that?|

031351|310-en|en|wav/p310_092.wav|||I don't know why she is not here.|
031352|310-en|en|wav/p310_093.wav|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
031353|310-en|en|wav/p310_094.wav|||I agree with them.|
031354|310-en|en|wav/p310_095.wav|||I feel very strongly about that.|
031355|310-en|en|wav/p310_096.wav|||Now he will have to start again.|
031356|310-en|en|wav/p310_097.wav|||It is a difficult thing to explain.|
031357|310-en|en|wav/p310_098.wav|||I don't know how it happened.|

031364|310-en|en|wav/p310_105.wav|||His treatment has been quite atrocious.|
031365|310-en|en|wav/p310_106.wav|||It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.|
031366|310-en|en|wav/p310_107.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
031367|310-en|en|wav/p310_108.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|

031377|310-en|en|wav/p310_118.wav|||It may be argued.|

031380|310-en|en|wav/p310_121.wav|||And who were they anyway, beforehand?|

031389|310-en|en|wav/p310_130.wav|||Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.|
031390|310-en|en|wav/p310_131.wav|||David was not either.|
031391|310-en|en|wav/p310_132.wav|||Britain may now be forced to listen.|
031392|310-en|en|wav/p310_133.wav|||We don't see it as downgrading.|
031393|310-en|en|wav/p310_134.wav|||He wanted someone young and ambitious.|
031394|310-en|en|wav/p310_135.wav|||No date has been set for the appeal.|

031398|310-en|en|wav/p310_139.wav|||The starting point is pretty unusual.|
031399|310-en|en|wav/p310_140.wav|||However, they will only be found in the wild.|
031400|310-en|en|wav/p310_141.wav|||They receive a high profile in the media.|
031401|310-en|en|wav/p310_142.wav|||It was an ambush.|
031402|310-en|en|wav/p310_143.wav|||I think this proposal is excellent.|
031403|310-en|en|wav/p310_144.wav|||If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.|
031404|310-en|en|wav/p310_145.wav|||Is that too much to ask?|
031405|310-en|en|wav/p310_146.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|

031412|310-en|en|wav/p310_153.wav|||This is a job for the Government.|
031413|310-en|en|wav/p310_154.wav|||I felt the head was very like me.|
031414|310-en|en|wav/p310_155.wav|||We started with that.|
031415|310-en|en|wav/p310_156.wav|||And he had much need.|
031416|310-en|en|wav/p310_157.wav|||Last night the bombardment was terrible.|
031417|310-en|en|wav/p310_158.wav|||This can only help us go forward.|

031419|310-en|en|wav/p310_160.wav|||But, even so, you always want to try something new.|

031421|310-en|en|wav/p310_162.wav|||I hadn't been looking after myself.|
031422|310-en|en|wav/p310_163.wav|||I was over the moon.|
031423|310-en|en|wav/p310_164.wav|||And really, the songs are the key thing.|
031424|310-en|en|wav/p310_165.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031425|310-en|en|wav/p310_166.wav|||His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.|
031426|310-en|en|wav/p310_167.wav|||Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.|
031427|310-en|en|wav/p310_168.wav|||And then came the seventies.|
031428|310-en|en|wav/p310_169.wav|||I guess it is down to focus.|
031429|310-en|en|wav/p310_170.wav|||Last week, he was taken to the hospital.|
031430|310-en|en|wav/p310_171.wav|||You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.|
031431|310-en|en|wav/p310_172.wav|||His track record is not promising.|
031432|310-en|en|wav/p310_173.wav|||No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.|
031433|310-en|en|wav/p310_174.wav|||He put a lot of effort into it.|
031434|310-en|en|wav/p310_175.wav|||However, you have just got to adjust it.|
031435|310-en|en|wav/p310_176.wav|||That was moving the goalposts.|
031436|310-en|en|wav/p310_177.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
031437|310-en|en|wav/p310_178.wav|||We have the location, which is assured.|
031438|310-en|en|wav/p310_179.wav|||The club are feeling no different today.|
031439|310-en|en|wav/p310_180.wav|||What if the confession is, after all, a fake?|
031440|310-en|en|wav/p310_181.wav|||I see the extended family once a year.|
031441|310-en|en|wav/p310_182.wav|||I'm not a magician.|
031442|310-en|en|wav/p310_183.wav|||We couldn't go very fast.|
031443|310-en|en|wav/p310_185.wav|||There was even a joke.|
031444|310-en|en|wav/p310_186.wav|||Tony Blair, can you see her face?|
031445|310-en|en|wav/p310_187.wav|||This guy is never going to give up.|

031447|310-en|en|wav/p310_189.wav|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|
031448|310-en|en|wav/p310_190.wav|||The show is small but perfectly formed.|
031449|310-en|en|wav/p310_191.wav|||This is the first job of the director - leadership.|
031450|310-en|en|wav/p310_192.wav|||It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.|
031451|310-en|en|wav/p310_193.wav|||It is too early to speculate.|
031452|310-en|en|wav/p310_194.wav|||I just had so much fun.|
031453|310-en|en|wav/p310_195.wav|||Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.|
031454|310-en|en|wav/p310_196.wav|||I will wait until later.|
031455|310-en|en|wav/p310_197.wav|||Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.|
031456|310-en|en|wav/p310_198.wav|||She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|
031457|310-en|en|wav/p310_199.wav|||Or so we have long assumed.|
031458|310-en|en|wav/p310_200.wav|||They responded with victories.|
031459|310-en|en|wav/p310_201.wav|||That was the personal impulse.|
031460|310-en|en|wav/p310_202.wav|||I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|
031461|310-en|en|wav/p310_203.wav|||But first it goes out on TV.|

031464|310-en|en|wav/p310_206.wav|||I think it's awful.|
031465|310-en|en|wav/p310_207.wav|||Who is going to be penalised?|
031466|310-en|en|wav/p310_208.wav|||This will be just another tax on motorists.|
031467|310-en|en|wav/p310_209.wav|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
031468|310-en|en|wav/p310_210.wav|||One must hope not!|
031469|310-en|en|wav/p310_211.wav|||He is a Satan.|
031470|310-en|en|wav/p310_212.wav|||Just see where the blood is coming from.|
031471|310-en|en|wav/p310_213.wav|||He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.|
031472|310-en|en|wav/p310_214.wav|||In her opinion, the rich are different.|
031473|310-en|en|wav/p310_215.wav|||Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.|
031474|310-en|en|wav/p310_216.wav|||I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.|
031475|310-en|en|wav/p310_217.wav|||There was no cohesion.|
031476|310-en|en|wav/p310_218.wav|||He was jailed for five years.|
031477|310-en|en|wav/p310_219.wav|||Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|
031478|310-en|en|wav/p310_220.wav|||We will not break even.|
031479|310-en|en|wav/p310_221.wav|||We will look into it.|
031480|310-en|en|wav/p310_222.wav|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
031481|310-en|en|wav/p310_223.wav|||But he's not afraid to take risks.|
031482|310-en|en|wav/p310_224.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
031483|310-en|en|wav/p310_225.wav|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
031484|310-en|en|wav/p310_226.wav|||However, it very nearly went wrong.|
031485|310-en|en|wav/p310_227.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
031486|310-en|en|wav/p310_228.wav|||Things are moving together.|
031487|310-en|en|wav/p310_229.wav|||I get to work with very good people.|
031488|310-en|en|wav/p310_230.wav|||A quality audit officer has also been appointed.|
031489|310-en|en|wav/p310_231.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
031490|310-en|en|wav/p310_232.wav|||Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.|
031491|310-en|en|wav/p310_233.wav|||Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.|
031492|310-en|en|wav/p310_234.wav|||Look at the table.|
031493|310-en|en|wav/p310_235.wav|||This film will be totally awesome.|
031494|310-en|en|wav/p310_236.wav|||I don't think the Saudis will lay down.|
031495|310-en|en|wav/p310_237.wav|||Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.|
031496|310-en|en|wav/p310_238.wav|||Last year was not a good year.|
031497|310-en|en|wav/p310_239.wav|||It's a difficult job.|
031498|310-en|en|wav/p310_240.wav|||We can't get over it.|
031499|310-en|en|wav/p310_241.wav|||Several hundred people attended yesterday.|
031500|310-en|en|wav/p310_242.wav|||My preference is for the single vaccines.|
031501|310-en|en|wav/p310_243.wav|||This represents a tough game for us.|
031502|310-en|en|wav/p310_244.wav|||He saw it all as a big game.|
031503|310-en|en|wav/p310_245.wav|||They are not an item.|
031504|310-en|en|wav/p310_246.wav|||And thought we would get away with it.|
031505|310-en|en|wav/p310_247.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
031506|310-en|en|wav/p310_248.wav|||It's more like a Labour Party rally.|
031507|310-en|en|wav/p310_249.wav|||Staff should be paid for what they produce.|
031508|310-en|en|wav/p310_250.wav|||I would urge the Government to think again.|
031509|310-en|en|wav/p310_251.wav|||It will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
031510|310-en|en|wav/p310_252.wav|||They were on holiday in Egypt.|
031511|310-en|en|wav/p310_253.wav|||I was happiest with my short game.|
031512|310-en|en|wav/p310_254.wav|||We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?|
031513|310-en|en|wav/p310_255.wav|||We went on to become very successful.|
031514|310-en|en|wav/p310_256.wav|||Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.|
031515|310-en|en|wav/p310_257.wav|||No, is the answer to your first question.|
031516|310-en|en|wav/p310_258.wav|||We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.|
031517|310-en|en|wav/p310_259.wav|||That could be at least five years away.|
031518|310-en|en|wav/p310_260.wav|||That is my role.|
031519|310-en|en|wav/p310_261.wav|||He also presented You Bet!|
031520|310-en|en|wav/p310_262.wav|||That's the day job.|
031521|310-en|en|wav/p310_263.wav|||It really is taken seriously.|
031522|310-en|en|wav/p310_264.wav|||We have not given up hope.|
031523|310-en|en|wav/p310_265.wav|||I'm looking at ways to do that now.|
031524|310-en|en|wav/p310_266.wav|||Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.|
031525|310-en|en|wav/p310_267.wav|||It's such a trial!|
031526|310-en|en|wav/p310_268.wav|||That kind of growth is the important thing.|
031527|310-en|en|wav/p310_269.wav|||I think it is totally wrong.|
031528|310-en|en|wav/p310_270.wav|||And a film maker was born.|
031529|310-en|en|wav/p310_271.wav|||It was also put on the Internet.|
031530|310-en|en|wav/p310_272.wav|||The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.|
031531|310-en|en|wav/p310_273.wav|||And yet his legacy is doubtful.|
031532|310-en|en|wav/p310_274.wav|||It seems to have worked.|
031533|310-en|en|wav/p310_275.wav|||Top-up fees are not on the agenda.|
031534|310-en|en|wav/p310_276.wav|||There was a battle there.|
031535|310-en|en|wav/p310_277.wav|||This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.|
031536|310-en|en|wav/p310_278.wav|||Well, when did he ever refuse?|
031537|310-en|en|wav/p310_279.wav|||Today's ruling confirms that.|
031538|310-en|en|wav/p310_280.wav|||It's good news and long overdue.|
031539|310-en|en|wav/p310_281.wav|||THE atmosphere was electric.|
031540|310-en|en|wav/p310_282.wav|||I'd never heard him in person before.|
031541|310-en|en|wav/p310_283.wav|||We're going to change our party.|
031542|310-en|en|wav/p310_284.wav|||Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.|
031543|310-en|en|wav/p310_285.wav|||I have learned a lot from him.|
031544|310-en|en|wav/p310_286.wav|||Is he any good in the kitchen?|
031545|310-en|en|wav/p310_287.wav|||He has been campaigning for change for years.|
031546|310-en|en|wav/p310_288.wav|||A formal decision will be announced within months.|
031547|310-en|en|wav/p310_289.wav|||He must have something up his sleeve.|
031548|310-en|en|wav/p310_290.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
031549|310-en|en|wav/p310_291.wav|||We make good weapons.|
031550|310-en|en|wav/p310_292.wav|||So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.|
031551|310-en|en|wav/p310_293.wav|||This is not a Scottish problem.|
031552|310-en|en|wav/p310_294.wav|||Then followed a bout of flu.|
031553|310-en|en|wav/p310_295.wav|||The balance isn't there at EMI.|
031554|310-en|en|wav/p310_296.wav|||That was the most annoying thing.|
031555|310-en|en|wav/p310_297.wav|||We are being hijacked.|
031556|310-en|en|wav/p310_298.wav|||We had no part in it.|
031557|310-en|en|wav/p310_299.wav|||It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.|
031558|310-en|en|wav/p310_300.wav|||Mike Tyson went to prison.|
031559|310-en|en|wav/p310_301.wav|||It was nice to get a clean sheet.|
031560|310-en|en|wav/p310_302.wav|||Our young people are leaving.|
031561|310-en|en|wav/p310_303.wav|||And there is no cause for it.|
031562|310-en|en|wav/p310_304.wav|||That would have been too easy.|
031563|310-en|en|wav/p310_305.wav|||She admitted the theft of letters and deception.|
031564|310-en|en|wav/p310_306.wav|||This is not a faceless system.|
031565|310-en|en|wav/p310_307.wav|||This is a long-term discussion paper.|
031566|310-en|en|wav/p310_308.wav|||In all cases computer equipment was seized.|
031567|310-en|en|wav/p310_309.wav|||It is just like the stock market.|
031568|310-en|en|wav/p310_310.wav|||The damage from the fire was huge.|
031569|310-en|en|wav/p310_311.wav|||That's what it's all about, isn't it?|
031570|310-en|en|wav/p310_312.wav|||Both agreed on the success of the event.|
031571|310-en|en|wav/p310_313.wav|||What, then, is the real thing?|
031572|310-en|en|wav/p310_314.wav|||Boarding school was equally protective.|
031573|310-en|en|wav/p310_315.wav|||Most people know that.|
031574|310-en|en|wav/p310_316.wav|||It will be the final push.|
031575|310-en|en|wav/p310_317.wav|||Clearly, this was the important nursing.|
031576|310-en|en|wav/p310_318.wav|||Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.|
031577|310-en|en|wav/p310_319.wav|||The campaign was raucous.|
031578|310-en|en|wav/p310_320.wav|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
031579|310-en|en|wav/p310_321.wav|||But both were involved with other matters.|
031580|310-en|en|wav/p310_322.wav|||But we were wrong.|
031581|310-en|en|wav/p310_323.wav|||The result today is an impasse.|
031582|310-en|en|wav/p310_324.wav|||However, in October another partnership was announced.|
031583|310-en|en|wav/p310_325.wav|||There is no threat to them.|
031584|310-en|en|wav/p310_326.wav|||Nelson does not disappoint.|
031585|310-en|en|wav/p310_327.wav|||The goal will stay with me forever.|
031586|310-en|en|wav/p310_328.wav|||The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.|
031587|310-en|en|wav/p310_329.wav|||Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.|
031588|310-en|en|wav/p310_330.wav|||It is a high time to act.|
031589|310-en|en|wav/p310_331.wav|||Then we will face the Danish champions.|
031590|310-en|en|wav/p310_332.wav|||He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.|
031591|310-en|en|wav/p310_333.wav|||The South African defended his work ethic.|
031592|310-en|en|wav/p310_334.wav|||We have a team to reach the final.|
031593|310-en|en|wav/p310_335.wav|||There was barely a handful of chances.|
031594|310-en|en|wav/p310_336.wav|||The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.|
031595|310-en|en|wav/p310_337.wav|||I have found my vision.|
031596|310-en|en|wav/p310_338.wav|||We don't know the scale of need.|
031597|310-en|en|wav/p310_339.wav|||You need a reason for staying.|
031598|310-en|en|wav/p310_340.wav|||Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.|
031599|310-en|en|wav/p310_341.wav|||However, we have not come to any conclusions.|
031600|310-en|en|wav/p310_342.wav|||I don't expect to see that this time.|
031601|310-en|en|wav/p310_343.wav|||You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.|
031602|310-en|en|wav/p310_344.wav|||The big issue for us is the review.|
031603|310-en|en|wav/p310_345.wav|||That is not the way we should operate.|
031604|310-en|en|wav/p310_346.wav|||More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.|
031605|310-en|en|wav/p310_347.wav|||The new work will begin in the autumn.|
031606|310-en|en|wav/p310_348.wav|||The written judgment was issued in printed form.|
031607|310-en|en|wav/p310_349.wav|||He showed he has some things to learn.|
031608|310-en|en|wav/p310_350.wav|||Or do they?|
031609|310-en|en|wav/p310_351.wav|||They are the innocent victims.|
031610|310-en|en|wav/p310_352.wav|||It is now time for justice.|
031611|310-en|en|wav/p310_353.wav|||That is of no use.|
031612|310-en|en|wav/p310_354.wav|||I could have been offended.|
031613|310-en|en|wav/p310_355.wav|||Now it is measuring it in dollars.|
031614|310-en|en|wav/p310_356.wav|||But he is frustrated at every turn.|
031615|310-en|en|wav/p310_357.wav|||He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.|
031616|310-en|en|wav/p310_358.wav|||This is the lowest of the low.|
031617|310-en|en|wav/p310_359.wav|||Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.|
031618|310-en|en|wav/p310_360.wav|||Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.|
031619|310-en|en|wav/p310_361.wav|||He's a nice guy.|
031620|310-en|en|wav/p310_362.wav|||The milk industry is in turmoil.|
031621|310-en|en|wav/p310_363.wav|||I love the moment of being first.|
031622|310-en|en|wav/p310_364.wav|||It is a decision which has paid off.|
031623|310-en|en|wav/p310_365.wav|||Their mind was already made up.|
031624|310-en|en|wav/p310_366.wav|||I had some time with Aston Villa.|
031625|310-en|en|wav/p310_367.wav|||But it's got to be worth it.|
031626|310-en|en|wav/p310_368.wav|||But does the same thing happen with music?|
031627|310-en|en|wav/p310_369.wav|||I just couldn't believe what had happened.|
031628|310-en|en|wav/p310_370.wav|||Alex is a big part of that future.|
031629|310-en|en|wav/p310_371.wav|||Pray that is so.|
031630|310-en|en|wav/p310_372.wav|||In fact it isn't related to either.|
031631|310-en|en|wav/p310_373.wav|||There was support from across the board.|
031632|310-en|en|wav/p310_374.wav|||There may be some evidence to this effect.|
031633|310-en|en|wav/p310_375.wav|||It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.|
031634|310-en|en|wav/p310_376.wav|||So what does one do?|
031635|310-en|en|wav/p310_377.wav|||Such actions are rarely popular.|
031636|310-en|en|wav/p310_378.wav|||The methadone programme is completely out of control.|
031637|310-en|en|wav/p310_379.wav|||That is why it's so lyrical.|
031638|310-en|en|wav/p310_380.wav|||I joined a group.|
031639|310-en|en|wav/p310_381.wav|||I've heard this stuff about the markets.|
031640|310-en|en|wav/p310_382.wav|||It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|
031641|310-en|en|wav/p310_383.wav|||It has removed a bit of guilt.|
031642|310-en|en|wav/p310_384.wav|||And they all had these other commitments.|
031643|310-en|en|wav/p310_385.wav|||However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.|
031644|310-en|en|wav/p310_386.wav|||Here, again, they were denied a voice.|
031645|310-en|en|wav/p310_387.wav|||They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.|
031646|310-en|en|wav/p310_388.wav|||Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.|
031647|310-en|en|wav/p310_389.wav|||I never agreed with that.|
031648|310-en|en|wav/p310_390.wav|||I didn't actually believe them at first.|
031649|310-en|en|wav/p310_391.wav|||Have you heard anything from Paramount?|
031650|310-en|en|wav/p310_392.wav|||We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.|
031651|310-en|en|wav/p310_393.wav|||We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.|
031652|310-en|en|wav/p310_394.wav|||There was only one hole in it.|
031653|310-en|en|wav/p310_395.wav|||I don't think it's vital.|
031654|310-en|en|wav/p310_396.wav|||It might not survive the process.|
031655|310-en|en|wav/p310_397.wav|||They keep the atmosphere in mind.|
031656|310-en|en|wav/p310_398.wav|||My father died in childbirth.|
031657|310-en|en|wav/p310_399.wav|||The issue has still to be resolved.|
031658|310-en|en|wav/p310_400.wav|||Which brings us to the Scottish connection.|
031659|310-en|en|wav/p310_401.wav|||It is a catalogue of obstruction.|
031660|310-en|en|wav/p310_402.wav|||I'm happy to contribute to that.|
031661|310-en|en|wav/p310_403.wav|||Despite the result, it was still a great moment.|
031662|310-en|en|wav/p310_404.wav|||We were close, but not close enough.|
031663|310-en|en|wav/p310_405.wav|||And that started me thinking.|
031664|310-en|en|wav/p310_406.wav|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
031665|310-en|en|wav/p310_407.wav|||It brings together two essential elements.|
031666|310-en|en|wav/p310_408.wav|||Is it the players, or is it the coaches?|
031667|310-en|en|wav/p310_409.wav|||We had a reunion last week.|
031668|310-en|en|wav/p310_410.wav|||This will help our confidence.|
031669|310-en|en|wav/p310_411.wav|||We have high hopes that this will work.|
031670|310-en|en|wav/p310_412.wav|||They also have good neighbours.|
031671|310-en|en|wav/p310_413.wav|||People ask about the concept of a team.|
031672|310-en|en|wav/p310_414.wav|||Who has he fought?|
031673|310-en|en|wav/p310_415.wav|||The film is about the cost of genius.|
031674|310-en|en|wav/p310_416.wav|||They've been here before.|
031675|310-en|en|wav/p310_417.wav|||I want a free vote.|
031676|310-en|en|wav/p310_418.wav|||He came close to signing for Rangers, too.|
031677|310-en|en|wav/p310_419.wav|||It would show them a positive way forward.|
031678|310-en|en|wav/p310_420.wav|||I think it's a disgrace.|
031679|310-en|en|wav/p310_421.wav|||So he should be.|
031680|310-en|en|wav/p310_422.wav|||He also admitted possessing a firearm.|
031681|310-en|en|wav/p310_423.wav|||ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|
031682|310-en|en|wav/p310_424.wav|||Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.|
031683|311-en|en|wav/p311_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
031684|311-en|en|wav/p311_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
031685|311-en|en|wav/p311_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
031686|311-en|en|wav/p311_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
031687|311-en|en|wav/p311_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
031688|311-en|en|wav/p311_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
031689|311-en|en|wav/p311_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
031690|311-en|en|wav/p311_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
031691|311-en|en|wav/p311_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
031692|311-en|en|wav/p311_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
031693|311-en|en|wav/p311_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
031694|311-en|en|wav/p311_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
031695|311-en|en|wav/p311_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
031696|311-en|en|wav/p311_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
031697|311-en|en|wav/p311_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
031698|311-en|en|wav/p311_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
031699|311-en|en|wav/p311_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
031700|311-en|en|wav/p311_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
031701|311-en|en|wav/p311_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
031702|311-en|en|wav/p311_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
031703|311-en|en|wav/p311_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
031704|311-en|en|wav/p311_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
031705|311-en|en|wav/p311_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
031706|311-en|en|wav/p311_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
031707|311-en|en|wav/p311_025.wav|||No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.|
031708|311-en|en|wav/p311_026.wav|||It's ahead of Labour.|
031709|311-en|en|wav/p311_027.wav|||It is the whole package.|
031710|311-en|en|wav/p311_028.wav|||I was totally wrong.|
031711|311-en|en|wav/p311_029.wav|||It was a matter of chance.|
031712|311-en|en|wav/p311_030.wav|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
031713|311-en|en|wav/p311_031.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
031714|311-en|en|wav/p311_032.wav|||We keep a distance.|
031715|311-en|en|wav/p311_033.wav|||She went home from school and never returned.|
031716|311-en|en|wav/p311_034.wav|||Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.|
031717|311-en|en|wav/p311_035.wav|||With actors it is slightly different.|
031718|311-en|en|wav/p311_036.wav|||Green is desperate to play in The Open.|
031719|311-en|en|wav/p311_037.wav|||They did a very good job.|
031720|311-en|en|wav/p311_038.wav|||That's what we're still trying to do.|
031721|311-en|en|wav/p311_039.wav|||He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.|
031722|311-en|en|wav/p311_040.wav|||We cannot go on in this fashion.|
031723|311-en|en|wav/p311_041.wav|||We must learn to finish.|
031724|311-en|en|wav/p311_042.wav|||There can be no two ways about it.|
031725|311-en|en|wav/p311_043.wav|||I knew my contract was up this year.|
031726|311-en|en|wav/p311_044.wav|||I am content with the silver.|
031727|311-en|en|wav/p311_045.wav|||People acted too quickly.|
031728|311-en|en|wav/p311_046.wav|||My heart is with the artist.|
031729|311-en|en|wav/p311_047.wav|||That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.|
031730|311-en|en|wav/p311_048.wav|||There are different cultures in different departments.|
031731|311-en|en|wav/p311_049.wav|||What would you do if you didn't work?|
031732|311-en|en|wav/p311_050.wav|||They are already on the way there.|
031733|311-en|en|wav/p311_051.wav|||The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.|
031734|311-en|en|wav/p311_052.wav|||This is a holy place.|
031735|311-en|en|wav/p311_053.wav|||We will miss him very much.|
031736|311-en|en|wav/p311_054.wav|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
031737|311-en|en|wav/p311_055.wav|||They should go ahead as normal.|
031738|311-en|en|wav/p311_056.wav|||At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|
031739|311-en|en|wav/p311_057.wav|||It ended as it began, in confusion.|
031740|311-en|en|wav/p311_058.wav|||I just went a bit too far.|
031741|311-en|en|wav/p311_059.wav|||I am delighted for Simon.|
031742|311-en|en|wav/p311_060.wav|||His third goal was superb.|
031743|311-en|en|wav/p311_061.wav|||I don't have a problem with getting older.|
031744|311-en|en|wav/p311_062.wav|||It has been declared.|
031745|311-en|en|wav/p311_063.wav|||Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|
031746|311-en|en|wav/p311_064.wav|||The scientific debate is dead.|
031747|311-en|en|wav/p311_065.wav|||Only one got through.|
031748|311-en|en|wav/p311_066.wav|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
031749|311-en|en|wav/p311_067.wav|||He is a visionary.|
031750|311-en|en|wav/p311_068.wav|||I was the trial judge in both.|
031751|311-en|en|wav/p311_069.wav|||I have a choice.|
031752|311-en|en|wav/p311_070.wav|||It happens in many countries.|
031753|311-en|en|wav/p311_071.wav|||It's not just about the shows.|
031754|311-en|en|wav/p311_072.wav|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
031755|311-en|en|wav/p311_073.wav|||I have spoken to the skipper.|
031756|311-en|en|wav/p311_074.wav|||Already the children are dying.|
031757|311-en|en|wav/p311_075.wav|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
031758|311-en|en|wav/p311_076.wav|||We don't do this for everyone, of course.|
031759|311-en|en|wav/p311_077.wav|||I can't wait to meet him.|
031760|311-en|en|wav/p311_078.wav|||THE pain was almost too much to bear.|
031761|311-en|en|wav/p311_079.wav|||It's the same as Glasgow.|
031762|311-en|en|wav/p311_080.wav|||We've got a job to do.|
031763|311-en|en|wav/p311_081.wav|||You just have to adjust.|
031764|311-en|en|wav/p311_082.wav|||Well, that's just a third district.|
031765|311-en|en|wav/p311_083.wav|||I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.|
031766|311-en|en|wav/p311_084.wav|||They are there to help us.|
031767|311-en|en|wav/p311_085.wav|||He added, We are not prepared for war.|
031768|311-en|en|wav/p311_086.wav|||My wife and family are the support system.|
031769|311-en|en|wav/p311_087.wav|||Sub Not Used, McArthur.|
031770|311-en|en|wav/p311_088.wav|||I have hardly any commitments.|
031771|311-en|en|wav/p311_089.wav|||The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|
031772|311-en|en|wav/p311_090.wav|||It is a very special place.|
031773|311-en|en|wav/p311_091.wav|||Some things in life you have to accept.|
031774|311-en|en|wav/p311_092.wav|||I am relishing the challenge.|
031775|311-en|en|wav/p311_093.wav|||It is set in Paris.|
031776|311-en|en|wav/p311_094.wav|||The party has never fully recovered.|
031777|311-en|en|wav/p311_095.wav|||Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.|
031778|311-en|en|wav/p311_096.wav|||Surely history will not repeat itself.|
031779|311-en|en|wav/p311_097.wav|||The initial report has been completed.|
031780|311-en|en|wav/p311_098.wav|||He's got me very well.|
031781|311-en|en|wav/p311_099.wav|||It's like an extension of your body.|
031782|311-en|en|wav/p311_100.wav|||It is quite a new prescription.|
031783|311-en|en|wav/p311_101.wav|||Johnsen is equally concerned.|
031784|311-en|en|wav/p311_102.wav|||Which he is, too.|
031785|311-en|en|wav/p311_103.wav|||These matters are now behind us.|
031786|311-en|en|wav/p311_104.wav|||But things are never the same again.|
031787|311-en|en|wav/p311_105.wav|||It is easy to agree with him.|
031788|311-en|en|wav/p311_106.wav|||He, too, will return.|
031789|311-en|en|wav/p311_107.wav|||Is there anything in the wound?|
031790|311-en|en|wav/p311_108.wav|||Chambers said he would accept the place.|
031791|311-en|en|wav/p311_109.wav|||Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|
031792|311-en|en|wav/p311_110.wav|||It is not really used by many people.|
031793|311-en|en|wav/p311_111.wav|||There could be no dispute about our history.|
031794|311-en|en|wav/p311_112.wav|||He has one son and one daughter.|
031795|311-en|en|wav/p311_113.wav|||Don't get me wrong.|
031796|311-en|en|wav/p311_114.wav|||It is nearly there.|
031797|311-en|en|wav/p311_115.wav|||Otherwise we will pay the price.|
031798|311-en|en|wav/p311_116.wav|||I find it rather oppressive.|
031799|311-en|en|wav/p311_117.wav|||They are all Arabs.|
031800|311-en|en|wav/p311_118.wav|||It is already making a difference.|
031801|311-en|en|wav/p311_119.wav|||He decides to do something about it.|
031802|311-en|en|wav/p311_120.wav|||There were no new cases yesterday.|
031803|311-en|en|wav/p311_121.wav|||Someone else has now got them.|
031804|311-en|en|wav/p311_122.wav|||But once again it was not converted.|
031805|311-en|en|wav/p311_123.wav|||These figures are truly terrible.|
031806|311-en|en|wav/p311_124.wav|||This is a most serious matter.|
031807|311-en|en|wav/p311_125.wav|||I let go the telephone and ran.|
031808|311-en|en|wav/p311_126.wav|||Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.|
031809|311-en|en|wav/p311_127.wav|||After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|
031810|311-en|en|wav/p311_128.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
031811|311-en|en|wav/p311_129.wav|||The hearing was continued until a later date.|
031812|311-en|en|wav/p311_130.wav|||Still, some additions are inspired.|
031813|311-en|en|wav/p311_131.wav|||Planning is a key issue.|
031814|311-en|en|wav/p311_132.wav|||Did he always want to be a comedian?|
031815|311-en|en|wav/p311_133.wav|||The way ahead is not easy.|
031816|311-en|en|wav/p311_134.wav|||I could do a better job.|
031817|311-en|en|wav/p311_135.wav|||Yet what is supposed to be said?|
031818|311-en|en|wav/p311_136.wav|||Parole isn't a decision for me.|
031819|311-en|en|wav/p311_137.wav|||I get the bus.|
031820|311-en|en|wav/p311_138.wav|||We are still the best team in Britain.|
031821|311-en|en|wav/p311_139.wav|||They got the job done.|
031822|311-en|en|wav/p311_140.wav|||It's a horrific incident.|
031823|311-en|en|wav/p311_141.wav|||They have been contrasting years, certainly.|
031824|311-en|en|wav/p311_142.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
031825|311-en|en|wav/p311_143.wav|||We've not won anything yet.|
031826|311-en|en|wav/p311_144.wav|||They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|
031827|311-en|en|wav/p311_145.wav|||There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|
031828|311-en|en|wav/p311_146.wav|||They did not let him down.|
031829|311-en|en|wav/p311_147.wav|||I believe in trade unions.|
031830|311-en|en|wav/p311_148.wav|||This is in a league of its own.|
031831|311-en|en|wav/p311_149.wav|||It's been such a waste of money.|
031832|311-en|en|wav/p311_150.wav|||The money is not really our concern.|
031833|311-en|en|wav/p311_151.wav|||You just know it.|
031834|311-en|en|wav/p311_152.wav|||Now, she has completed a family tradition.|
031835|311-en|en|wav/p311_153.wav|||I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|
031836|311-en|en|wav/p311_154.wav|||We have the easy part.|
031837|311-en|en|wav/p311_155.wav|||At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.|
031838|311-en|en|wav/p311_156.wav|||It's like a high school play.|
031839|311-en|en|wav/p311_157.wav|||He was part of South Africa.|
031840|311-en|en|wav/p311_158.wav|||It's there for people to look at.|
031841|311-en|en|wav/p311_159.wav|||The party will make up its own mind.|
031842|311-en|en|wav/p311_160.wav|||At least two women were among those arrested.|
031843|311-en|en|wav/p311_161.wav|||They never got into the show this time.|
031844|311-en|en|wav/p311_162.wav|||But no, it's not funny.|
031845|311-en|en|wav/p311_163.wav|||In that case, the children were not missing.|
031846|311-en|en|wav/p311_164.wav|||He changed my life.|
031847|311-en|en|wav/p311_165.wav|||There was nothing else to match it.|
031848|311-en|en|wav/p311_166.wav|||Two options are being proposed.|
031849|311-en|en|wav/p311_167.wav|||They haven't been thought through.|
031850|311-en|en|wav/p311_168.wav|||The criteria have changed.|
031851|311-en|en|wav/p311_169.wav|||O, Is there a lot of blood?|
031852|311-en|en|wav/p311_170.wav|||Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|
031853|311-en|en|wav/p311_171.wav|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
031854|311-en|en|wav/p311_172.wav|||He was at home with his pals.|
031855|311-en|en|wav/p311_173.wav|||This is a very interesting move.|
031856|311-en|en|wav/p311_174.wav|||The highest rate is in Glasgow.|
031857|311-en|en|wav/p311_175.wav|||His only reply was a laugh.|
031858|311-en|en|wav/p311_176.wav|||those who are preparing to give up.|
031859|311-en|en|wav/p311_177.wav|||What kind of festival is proposed?|
031860|311-en|en|wav/p311_178.wav|||I was delighted with every one of them.|
031861|311-en|en|wav/p311_179.wav|||Sure the COE is a cracking band.|
031862|311-en|en|wav/p311_180.wav|||Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|
031863|311-en|en|wav/p311_181.wav|||That will help my case a bit.|
031864|311-en|en|wav/p311_182.wav|||It was entirely justified.|
031865|311-en|en|wav/p311_183.wav|||He looked at me before replying.|
031866|311-en|en|wav/p311_184.wav|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
031867|311-en|en|wav/p311_185.wav|||It feels that the game is off.|
031868|311-en|en|wav/p311_186.wav|||There will be no change in government.|
031869|311-en|en|wav/p311_187.wav|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
031870|311-en|en|wav/p311_188.wav|||But we still don't know.|
031871|311-en|en|wav/p311_189.wav|||Who do you think you are?|
031872|311-en|en|wav/p311_190.wav|||Glasgow is a tour de force.|
031873|311-en|en|wav/p311_191.wav|||I have no battle with the Scots.|
031874|311-en|en|wav/p311_192.wav|||It is all credit to them today.|
031875|311-en|en|wav/p311_193.wav|||I have done ever since it was published.|
031876|311-en|en|wav/p311_194.wav|||Nobody could survive on that.|
031877|311-en|en|wav/p311_195.wav|||They seem to turn up for them.|
031878|311-en|en|wav/p311_196.wav|||They were kept there for a summer.|
031879|311-en|en|wav/p311_197.wav|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
031880|311-en|en|wav/p311_198.wav|||It is that sort of film.|
031881|311-en|en|wav/p311_199.wav|||She was not hard done by.|
031882|311-en|en|wav/p311_200.wav|||Can you believe it?|
031883|311-en|en|wav/p311_201.wav|||I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|
031884|311-en|en|wav/p311_202.wav|||They are now out in the cold.|
031885|311-en|en|wav/p311_203.wav|||However, planners should be taking the lead.|
031886|311-en|en|wav/p311_204.wav|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
031887|311-en|en|wav/p311_205.wav|||Our message was inclusive.|
031888|311-en|en|wav/p311_206.wav|||This has been a shock.|
031889|311-en|en|wav/p311_207.wav|||Yet the survey has been cautious.|
031890|311-en|en|wav/p311_208.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
031891|311-en|en|wav/p311_209.wav|||There has also been some Scots input.|
031892|311-en|en|wav/p311_210.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
031893|311-en|en|wav/p311_211.wav|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
031894|311-en|en|wav/p311_212.wav|||But who will buy it?|
031895|311-en|en|wav/p311_213.wav|||It had to be more flexible.|
031896|311-en|en|wav/p311_214.wav|||Openness is always the best way.|
031897|311-en|en|wav/p311_215.wav|||It wouldn't go off.|
031898|311-en|en|wav/p311_216.wav|||It can be halted.|
031899|311-en|en|wav/p311_217.wav|||This was a lot of numbers.|
031900|311-en|en|wav/p311_218.wav|||Would it be good for the Nationwide League?|
031901|311-en|en|wav/p311_219.wav|||Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|
031902|311-en|en|wav/p311_220.wav|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
031903|311-en|en|wav/p311_221.wav|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
031904|311-en|en|wav/p311_222.wav|||The professor said the results were positive.|
031905|311-en|en|wav/p311_223.wav|||I think he's the favourite, no question.|
031906|311-en|en|wav/p311_224.wav|||But it's just great to have won.|
031907|311-en|en|wav/p311_225.wav|||And it paid off.|
031908|311-en|en|wav/p311_226.wav|||Gone with them is any sense of narrative.|
031909|311-en|en|wav/p311_227.wav|||Those Were The Days, indeed.|
031910|311-en|en|wav/p311_228.wav|||I never made any offer to Mark.|
031911|311-en|en|wav/p311_229.wav|||It should be scrapped.|
031912|311-en|en|wav/p311_230.wav|||He admitted the asylum system was not working.|
031913|311-en|en|wav/p311_231.wav|||They are just trying to cover up.|
031914|311-en|en|wav/p311_232.wav|||We have to defend ourselves.|
031915|311-en|en|wav/p311_233.wav|||I came here this week to work.|
031916|311-en|en|wav/p311_234.wav|||Where do we go from here?|
031917|311-en|en|wav/p311_235.wav|||Barry Ferguson is one of them.|
031918|311-en|en|wav/p311_236.wav|||He gets his moment.|
031919|311-en|en|wav/p311_237.wav|||This was an option from the beginning.|
031920|311-en|en|wav/p311_238.wav|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
031921|311-en|en|wav/p311_239.wav|||It's not a party, no, no.|
031922|311-en|en|wav/p311_240.wav|||It's not that clear-cut.|
031923|311-en|en|wav/p311_241.wav|||It may not be life long.|
031924|311-en|en|wav/p311_242.wav|||It was just above the roof.|
031925|311-en|en|wav/p311_243.wav|||It has changed, and not for the better.|
031926|311-en|en|wav/p311_244.wav|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
031927|311-en|en|wav/p311_245.wav|||Everyone must be focused on the league.|
031928|311-en|en|wav/p311_246.wav|||The English are coming.|
031929|311-en|en|wav/p311_247.wav|||I believe in theatre.|
031930|311-en|en|wav/p311_248.wav|||Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|
031931|311-en|en|wav/p311_249.wav|||However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|
031932|311-en|en|wav/p311_250.wav|||It's time to say enough is enough.|
031933|311-en|en|wav/p311_251.wav|||Mentally, you have to be tough.|
031934|311-en|en|wav/p311_252.wav|||He has to pull back from the brink.|
031935|311-en|en|wav/p311_253.wav|||She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|
031936|311-en|en|wav/p311_254.wav|||That's my daughter acting.|
031937|311-en|en|wav/p311_255.wav|||The film has also been superbly designed.|
031938|311-en|en|wav/p311_256.wav|||The performance was really, really immense.|
031939|311-en|en|wav/p311_257.wav|||Faces from the Eighties.|
031940|311-en|en|wav/p311_258.wav|||The family baton is handed on.|
031941|311-en|en|wav/p311_259.wav|||How can this be?|
031942|311-en|en|wav/p311_260.wav|||We are still alive and kicking.|
031943|311-en|en|wav/p311_261.wav|||I want to go now.|
031944|311-en|en|wav/p311_262.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
031945|311-en|en|wav/p311_263.wav|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
031946|311-en|en|wav/p311_264.wav|||All the children on the roll are genuine.|
031947|311-en|en|wav/p311_265.wav|||They said we were out of touch.|
031948|311-en|en|wav/p311_266.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
031949|311-en|en|wav/p311_267.wav|||There is no signature.|
031950|311-en|en|wav/p311_268.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
031951|311-en|en|wav/p311_269.wav|||The kids are paying the price.|
031952|311-en|en|wav/p311_270.wav|||He said he was delighted by the award.|
031953|311-en|en|wav/p311_271.wav|||They didn't find any substance.|
031954|311-en|en|wav/p311_272.wav|||They still have the dirty work to do.|
031955|311-en|en|wav/p311_273.wav|||I've never seen a game like it.|
031956|311-en|en|wav/p311_274.wav|||It doesn't seem like that long ago.|
031957|311-en|en|wav/p311_275.wav|||He will do very well.|
031958|311-en|en|wav/p311_276.wav|||They also intend to travel today.|
031959|311-en|en|wav/p311_277.wav|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
031960|311-en|en|wav/p311_278.wav|||The casualties were not named.|
031961|311-en|en|wav/p311_279.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
031962|311-en|en|wav/p311_280.wav|||There are two ways to start a festival.|
031963|311-en|en|wav/p311_281.wav|||I am very happy with life.|
031964|311-en|en|wav/p311_282.wav|||Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|
031965|311-en|en|wav/p311_283.wav|||My office is down there.|
031966|311-en|en|wav/p311_284.wav|||Even then this game was not over.|
031967|311-en|en|wav/p311_285.wav|||Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.|
031968|311-en|en|wav/p311_286.wav|||We also hope to meet the men.|
031969|311-en|en|wav/p311_287.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
031970|311-en|en|wav/p311_288.wav|||It has become very confused.|
031971|311-en|en|wav/p311_289.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
031972|311-en|en|wav/p311_290.wav|||I am not in denial.|
031973|311-en|en|wav/p311_291.wav|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
031974|311-en|en|wav/p311_292.wav|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
031975|311-en|en|wav/p311_293.wav|||There is a solution, she believes.|
031976|311-en|en|wav/p311_294.wav|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
031977|311-en|en|wav/p311_295.wav|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
031978|311-en|en|wav/p311_296.wav|||Then there's the Old Firm.|
031979|311-en|en|wav/p311_297.wav|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
031980|311-en|en|wav/p311_298.wav|||We were in different places, usually in cellars.|
031981|311-en|en|wav/p311_299.wav|||They're not always the same person.|
031982|311-en|en|wav/p311_300.wav|||It would have to be backdated.|
031983|311-en|en|wav/p311_301.wav|||He said he was sorry.|
031984|311-en|en|wav/p311_302.wav|||My position on the euro is quite clear.|
031985|311-en|en|wav/p311_303.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
031986|311-en|en|wav/p311_304.wav|||We have worked well with them for years.|
031987|311-en|en|wav/p311_305.wav|||That was me today.|
031988|311-en|en|wav/p311_306.wav|||That is the consistent approach of the Government.|
031989|311-en|en|wav/p311_307.wav|||That is when we are really effective.|
031990|311-en|en|wav/p311_308.wav|||The director's a genius.|
031991|311-en|en|wav/p311_309.wav|||There was no sign that anything was amiss.|
031992|311-en|en|wav/p311_310.wav|||It was the climax of the thing.|
031993|311-en|en|wav/p311_311.wav|||This is new money.|
031994|311-en|en|wav/p311_312.wav|||We have not given up on the game.|
031995|311-en|en|wav/p311_313.wav|||The decision was left entirely to him.|
031996|311-en|en|wav/p311_314.wav|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
031997|311-en|en|wav/p311_315.wav|||Nobody should believe this story.|
031998|311-en|en|wav/p311_316.wav|||This is not out of choice.|
031999|311-en|en|wav/p311_317.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
032000|311-en|en|wav/p311_318.wav|||But this one has a lot of potential.|
032001|311-en|en|wav/p311_319.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
032002|311-en|en|wav/p311_320.wav|||We'll see what happens.|
032003|311-en|en|wav/p311_321.wav|||This was another video cassette.|
032004|311-en|en|wav/p311_322.wav|||If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|
032005|311-en|en|wav/p311_323.wav|||It will make a huge difference.|
032006|311-en|en|wav/p311_324.wav|||He pretended not to care.|
032007|311-en|en|wav/p311_325.wav|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
032008|311-en|en|wav/p311_326.wav|||I was in tears in the street.|
032009|311-en|en|wav/p311_327.wav|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
032010|311-en|en|wav/p311_328.wav|||No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.|
032011|311-en|en|wav/p311_329.wav|||But that's not the idea behind this article.|
032012|311-en|en|wav/p311_330.wav|||If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|
032013|311-en|en|wav/p311_331.wav|||That is why we are here.|
032014|311-en|en|wav/p311_332.wav|||The German had a point to make.|
032015|311-en|en|wav/p311_333.wav|||This time, however, may have been different.|
032016|311-en|en|wav/p311_334.wav|||You have to feel for the guy.|
032017|311-en|en|wav/p311_335.wav|||However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|
032018|311-en|en|wav/p311_336.wav|||Bomber was not amused.|
032019|311-en|en|wav/p311_337.wav|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
032020|311-en|en|wav/p311_338.wav|||Was it just negligent.|
032021|311-en|en|wav/p311_339.wav|||And suddenly it became a free-for-all.|
032022|311-en|en|wav/p311_340.wav|||This Government is cutting taxes.|
032023|311-en|en|wav/p311_341.wav|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
032024|311-en|en|wav/p311_342.wav|||This is a big club.|
032025|311-en|en|wav/p311_343.wav|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
032026|311-en|en|wav/p311_344.wav|||They will now get that support.|
032027|311-en|en|wav/p311_345.wav|||I feel it's time to make the switch.|
032028|311-en|en|wav/p311_346.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
032029|311-en|en|wav/p311_347.wav|||I've no problem with what they said.|
032030|311-en|en|wav/p311_348.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
032031|311-en|en|wav/p311_349.wav|||I think we have got the balance right.|
032032|311-en|en|wav/p311_350.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
032033|311-en|en|wav/p311_351.wav|||It is physical but it is also good.|
032034|311-en|en|wav/p311_352.wav|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
032035|311-en|en|wav/p311_353.wav|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|
032036|311-en|en|wav/p311_354.wav|||So it goes on.|
032037|311-en|en|wav/p311_355.wav|||We think a lot of Allan McGregor.|
032038|311-en|en|wav/p311_356.wav|||I hope they will understand the reasons.|
032039|311-en|en|wav/p311_357.wav|||They should have listened to me.|
032040|311-en|en|wav/p311_358.wav|||I am greatly encouraged.|
032041|311-en|en|wav/p311_359.wav|||It was like someone had died.|
032042|311-en|en|wav/p311_360.wav|||What does he want him to look like?|
032043|311-en|en|wav/p311_361.wav|||The actors are confident and polished.|
032044|311-en|en|wav/p311_362.wav|||I hope he would have been very pleased.|
032045|311-en|en|wav/p311_363.wav|||We would have concerns about that.|
032046|311-en|en|wav/p311_364.wav|||Taxes may need to rise.|
032047|311-en|en|wav/p311_365.wav|||It's unusual to say the least.|
032048|311-en|en|wav/p311_366.wav|||All inquiries should be made to the police.|
032049|311-en|en|wav/p311_367.wav|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|
032050|311-en|en|wav/p311_368.wav|||I just did not cope with the pressure.|
032051|311-en|en|wav/p311_369.wav|||We have some concerns.|
032052|311-en|en|wav/p311_370.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
032053|311-en|en|wav/p311_371.wav|||This was a chilling echo.|
032054|311-en|en|wav/p311_372.wav|||They really want to do it.|
032055|311-en|en|wav/p311_373.wav|||And then he laughs.|
032056|311-en|en|wav/p311_374.wav|||I recommend a tour.|
032057|311-en|en|wav/p311_375.wav|||We don't ask for much.|
032058|311-en|en|wav/p311_376.wav|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
032059|311-en|en|wav/p311_377.wav|||I had a wonderful time working with him.|
032060|311-en|en|wav/p311_378.wav|||We have to start again on Saturday.|
032061|311-en|en|wav/p311_379.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
032062|311-en|en|wav/p311_380.wav|||And it covers the spectrum.|
032063|311-en|en|wav/p311_381.wav|||The replacements made a big difference.|
032064|311-en|en|wav/p311_382.wav|||And the winners are.|
032065|311-en|en|wav/p311_383.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
032066|311-en|en|wav/p311_384.wav|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|
032067|311-en|en|wav/p311_385.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
032068|311-en|en|wav/p311_386.wav|||There are big names.|
032069|311-en|en|wav/p311_387.wav|||My players are precious to me.|
032070|311-en|en|wav/p311_388.wav|||That argument has been won.|
032071|311-en|en|wav/p311_389.wav|||Normally, they have been a pack of lies.|
032072|311-en|en|wav/p311_390.wav|||For us, that decision was hard to understand.|
032073|311-en|en|wav/p311_391.wav|||I had to calm down.|
032074|311-en|en|wav/p311_392.wav|||Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.|
032075|311-en|en|wav/p311_393.wav|||She returned home a few days later.|
032076|311-en|en|wav/p311_394.wav|||They haven't run away.|
032077|311-en|en|wav/p311_395.wav|||Nobody can take it away from me.|

032110|312-en|en|wav/p312_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
032111|312-en|en|wav/p312_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032112|312-en|en|wav/p312_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032113|312-en|en|wav/p312_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032114|312-en|en|wav/p312_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032115|312-en|en|wav/p312_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
032116|312-en|en|wav/p312_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032117|312-en|en|wav/p312_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

032121|312-en|en|wav/p312_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032122|312-en|en|wav/p312_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032123|312-en|en|wav/p312_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032124|312-en|en|wav/p312_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.|
032125|312-en|en|wav/p312_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.|
032126|312-en|en|wav/p312_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032128|312-en|en|wav/p312_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
032129|312-en|en|wav/p312_025.wav|||Perhaps that was their mistake.|
032130|312-en|en|wav/p312_026.wav|||This was a rationing decision.|

032139|312-en|en|wav/p312_035.wav|||It was quite distressing for the crew.|

032147|312-en|en|wav/p312_043.wav|||I think it must be the uniforms.|
032148|312-en|en|wav/p312_044.wav|||This is not a monument to the past.|
032149|312-en|en|wav/p312_045.wav|||I certainly hope not.|
032150|312-en|en|wav/p312_046.wav|||However, there could be more bad weather to come.|
032151|312-en|en|wav/p312_047.wav|||I feel pretty good.|

032155|312-en|en|wav/p312_051.wav|||I was in the zone in the morning.|
032156|312-en|en|wav/p312_052.wav|||We have to break that cycle.|
032157|312-en|en|wav/p312_053.wav|||In fact, it might just be the beginning.|

032283|312-en|en|wav/p312_179.wav|||You can't keep them separate.|
032284|312-en|en|wav/p312_180.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
032285|312-en|en|wav/p312_181.wav|||He was a legend.|
032286|312-en|en|wav/p312_182.wav|||That's when the story first appeared.|
032287|312-en|en|wav/p312_183.wav|||You're going to die.|
032288|312-en|en|wav/p312_184.wav|||There was a substantial explosion.|
032289|312-en|en|wav/p312_185.wav|||He will continue to provide support for them.|
032290|312-en|en|wav/p312_186.wav|||I'm going to see my friend.|
032291|312-en|en|wav/p312_187.wav|||We played too deeply.|
032292|312-en|en|wav/p312_188.wav|||I probably would have been a dancer.|
032293|312-en|en|wav/p312_189.wav|||There is a lot of heroin about.|
032294|312-en|en|wav/p312_190.wav|||We're going to see a Government in a hurry.|
032295|312-en|en|wav/p312_191.wav|||He never asked me for money.|
032296|312-en|en|wav/p312_192.wav|||I was a bit nervous.|
032297|312-en|en|wav/p312_193.wav|||There was no question of him not impressing.|
032298|312-en|en|wav/p312_194.wav|||However, we came through.|
032299|312-en|en|wav/p312_195.wav|||I love this tournament.|
032300|312-en|en|wav/p312_196.wav|||He had a heart problem.|
032301|312-en|en|wav/p312_197.wav|||I am desperate to play for Scotland.|
032302|312-en|en|wav/p312_198.wav|||It is a large number.|
032303|312-en|en|wav/p312_199.wav|||We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|
032304|312-en|en|wav/p312_200.wav|||Hear what they have to say.|
032305|312-en|en|wav/p312_201.wav|||Now there's a thought.|
032306|312-en|en|wav/p312_202.wav|||I believe that the answer is simple.|
032307|312-en|en|wav/p312_203.wav|||That, he claimed, was essential.|
032308|312-en|en|wav/p312_204.wav|||I was on the pitch and everything.|
032309|312-en|en|wav/p312_205.wav|||They told him to go to drama school.|
032310|312-en|en|wav/p312_206.wav|||Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|
032311|312-en|en|wav/p312_207.wav|||Let us hope so.|
032312|312-en|en|wav/p312_208.wav|||She looked very settled.|
032313|312-en|en|wav/p312_209.wav|||Of course he was right!|
032314|312-en|en|wav/p312_210.wav|||The next few months will tell.|
032315|312-en|en|wav/p312_211.wav|||It felt like my support system was leaving.|
032316|312-en|en|wav/p312_212.wav|||But my daughter has got nothing.|
032317|312-en|en|wav/p312_213.wav|||You can see their point.|
032318|312-en|en|wav/p312_214.wav|||Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.|
032319|312-en|en|wav/p312_215.wav|||The dangers are very obvious.|
032320|312-en|en|wav/p312_216.wav|||There were no casualties.|
032321|312-en|en|wav/p312_217.wav|||Is it in the right place?|
032322|312-en|en|wav/p312_218.wav|||I played well in my time there.|
032323|312-en|en|wav/p312_219.wav|||A teacher is, really, about unity.|
032324|312-en|en|wav/p312_220.wav|||They are still going to be impulsive.|
032325|312-en|en|wav/p312_221.wav|||I love you so very much.|
032326|312-en|en|wav/p312_222.wav|||The scheme was simple but extremely effective.|
032327|312-en|en|wav/p312_223.wav|||He is a very nice man.|
032328|312-en|en|wav/p312_224.wav|||We want to sort it out.|
032329|312-en|en|wav/p312_225.wav|||Sean Connery did not disappoint.|
032330|312-en|en|wav/p312_226.wav|||Such a city does not exist.|
032331|312-en|en|wav/p312_227.wav|||It made me determined to get back.|
032332|312-en|en|wav/p312_228.wav|||It was no avail.|
032333|312-en|en|wav/p312_229.wav|||We're going to see more extreme weather.|
032334|312-en|en|wav/p312_230.wav|||He was replaced by John Spencer.|
032335|312-en|en|wav/p312_231.wav|||Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.|
032336|312-en|en|wav/p312_232.wav|||That is in the very nature of farming.|
032337|312-en|en|wav/p312_233.wav|||And, also, when he does not have the ball.|
032338|312-en|en|wav/p312_234.wav|||It was worth the wait.|
032339|312-en|en|wav/p312_235.wav|||I love the tradition of vaudeville.|
032340|312-en|en|wav/p312_236.wav|||It will take place in July.|
032341|312-en|en|wav/p312_237.wav|||We must not give in to the bastards.|
032342|312-en|en|wav/p312_238.wav|||This is a major step forward for carers.|
032343|312-en|en|wav/p312_239.wav|||I think it was his parents.|
032344|312-en|en|wav/p312_240.wav|||Our commitment is to move forward.|
032345|312-en|en|wav/p312_241.wav|||Partly, it is his own fault.|
032346|312-en|en|wav/p312_242.wav|||It's a personal matter.|
032347|312-en|en|wav/p312_243.wav|||That's where it all started.|
032348|312-en|en|wav/p312_244.wav|||I won't go back.|
032349|312-en|en|wav/p312_245.wav|||Why has it taken so long?|
032350|312-en|en|wav/p312_246.wav|||You make the choice.|
032351|312-en|en|wav/p312_247.wav|||And does it?|
032352|312-en|en|wav/p312_248.wav|||I was proud of our lads.|
032353|312-en|en|wav/p312_249.wav|||These will finally be corrected by next week.|
032354|312-en|en|wav/p312_250.wav|||This kind of traffic is commonplace.|
032355|312-en|en|wav/p312_251.wav|||All would be under threat.|
032356|312-en|en|wav/p312_252.wav|||Was it a foul?|
032357|312-en|en|wav/p312_253.wav|||He leaves a beat.|
032358|312-en|en|wav/p312_254.wav|||Perhaps it was her demeanour.|
032359|312-en|en|wav/p312_255.wav|||It lasted longer than we thought.|
032360|312-en|en|wav/p312_256.wav|||Promises were not kept.|
032361|312-en|en|wav/p312_257.wav|||It hasn't happened, but other things have.|
032362|312-en|en|wav/p312_258.wav|||The claim was denied by first minister.|
032363|312-en|en|wav/p312_259.wav|||Who is he?|
032364|312-en|en|wav/p312_260.wav|||It has to be long-term commitment.|
032365|312-en|en|wav/p312_261.wav|||It was that bad, that low.|
032366|312-en|en|wav/p312_262.wav|||That would be a big mistake.|
032367|312-en|en|wav/p312_263.wav|||His arrival could be the making of them.|
032368|312-en|en|wav/p312_264.wav|||After all, this is the start of the giving age.|
032369|312-en|en|wav/p312_265.wav|||I said How much?|
032370|312-en|en|wav/p312_266.wav|||You are a liar.|
032371|312-en|en|wav/p312_267.wav|||The scheme has been funded by the Government.|
032372|312-en|en|wav/p312_268.wav|||We're still talking about it.|
032373|312-en|en|wav/p312_269.wav|||She would say he was still the best.|
032374|312-en|en|wav/p312_270.wav|||He finished the night in a cell.|
032375|312-en|en|wav/p312_271.wav|||I'm not afraid of that.|
032376|312-en|en|wav/p312_272.wav|||I don't know what he was shouting.|
032377|312-en|en|wav/p312_273.wav|||It is the icing on the cake.|
032378|312-en|en|wav/p312_274.wav|||It was a new ball game.|
032379|312-en|en|wav/p312_275.wav|||The people here are quite reserved.|
032380|312-en|en|wav/p312_276.wav|||Previously police had said that schools were safe.|
032381|312-en|en|wav/p312_277.wav|||Our legal advice is clear.|
032382|312-en|en|wav/p312_278.wav|||The past is history, not destiny.|
032383|312-en|en|wav/p312_279.wav|||These were the edited highlights.|
032384|312-en|en|wav/p312_280.wav|||All were within range of Israeli cities.|
032385|312-en|en|wav/p312_281.wav|||They were totally behind it.|
032386|312-en|en|wav/p312_282.wav|||However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.|
032387|312-en|en|wav/p312_283.wav|||We could do a lot worse.|
032388|312-en|en|wav/p312_284.wav|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
032389|312-en|en|wav/p312_285.wav|||Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.|
032390|312-en|en|wav/p312_286.wav|||It is all one-sided.|
032391|312-en|en|wav/p312_287.wav|||In the end, that was enough to beat England.|
032392|312-en|en|wav/p312_288.wav|||That was the initial attraction.|
032393|312-en|en|wav/p312_289.wav|||Who will take them after that?|
032394|312-en|en|wav/p312_290.wav|||He's also thinking long-term.|
032395|312-en|en|wav/p312_291.wav|||A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.|
032396|312-en|en|wav/p312_292.wav|||Trevor has been great.|
032397|312-en|en|wav/p312_293.wav|||It would also take time.|
032398|312-en|en|wav/p312_294.wav|||Rather than answer, she resigned.|
032399|312-en|en|wav/p312_295.wav|||She said No, he's not in Elgin today.|
032400|312-en|en|wav/p312_296.wav|||I was first in the door.|
032401|312-en|en|wav/p312_297.wav|||It is highly unlikely.|
032402|312-en|en|wav/p312_298.wav|||Bill is a mentor.|
032403|312-en|en|wav/p312_299.wav|||The atmosphere is businesslike.|
032404|312-en|en|wav/p312_300.wav|||I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|
032405|312-en|en|wav/p312_301.wav|||There will be no exceptions to this rule.|
032406|312-en|en|wav/p312_302.wav|||What makes a house a home?|
032407|312-en|en|wav/p312_303.wav|||Destruction came from within.|
032408|312-en|en|wav/p312_304.wav|||I think however, he was having a fit!|
032409|312-en|en|wav/p312_305.wav|||It is good to look back.|
032410|312-en|en|wav/p312_306.wav|||You can't do one without the other.|
032411|312-en|en|wav/p312_307.wav|||Obviously we want to stop the rot.|
032412|312-en|en|wav/p312_308.wav|||Chris Paterson was outstanding.|
032413|312-en|en|wav/p312_309.wav|||The casting of her husband was an accident.|
032414|312-en|en|wav/p312_310.wav|||I would say so.|
032415|312-en|en|wav/p312_311.wav|||It's not the end of the matter, of course.|
032416|312-en|en|wav/p312_312.wav|||Sub Not Used, McKay.|
032417|312-en|en|wav/p312_313.wav|||And they did just that.|
032418|312-en|en|wav/p312_314.wav|||You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.|
032419|312-en|en|wav/p312_315.wav|||She has left the island.|
032420|312-en|en|wav/p312_316.wav|||They had three children.|
032421|312-en|en|wav/p312_317.wav|||Our system is archaic.|
032422|312-en|en|wav/p312_318.wav|||She had kept the news from him.|
032423|312-en|en|wav/p312_319.wav|||We want to know about the policy.|
032424|312-en|en|wav/p312_320.wav|||It is not illegal.|
032425|312-en|en|wav/p312_321.wav|||I wouldn't say this is normal.|
032426|312-en|en|wav/p312_322.wav|||We don't have the credible evidence.|
032427|312-en|en|wav/p312_323.wav|||That will be the case on Tuesday.|
032428|312-en|en|wav/p312_324.wav|||It's one up to the Scots.|
032429|312-en|en|wav/p312_325.wav|||This is complete nonsense.|
032430|312-en|en|wav/p312_326.wav|||I don't want to use the term.|
032431|312-en|en|wav/p312_327.wav|||There is still hope.|
032432|312-en|en|wav/p312_328.wav|||It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.|
032433|312-en|en|wav/p312_329.wav|||It's all happening at a local level.|
032434|312-en|en|wav/p312_330.wav|||She is a great talent.|
032435|312-en|en|wav/p312_331.wav|||It's the big omission.|
032436|312-en|en|wav/p312_332.wav|||We do things in an appropriate way.|
032437|312-en|en|wav/p312_334.wav|||However, she is female, and so.|
032438|312-en|en|wav/p312_335.wav|||The playing is perfectly turned out.|
032439|312-en|en|wav/p312_336.wav|||He will be advised by me.|
032440|312-en|en|wav/p312_337.wav|||But he did not rule out further talks.|
032441|312-en|en|wav/p312_338.wav|||It's part of your life.|
032442|312-en|en|wav/p312_339.wav|||He had a horror.|
032443|312-en|en|wav/p312_340.wav|||We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.|
032444|312-en|en|wav/p312_341.wav|||This time we may not be seeking volunteers.|
032445|312-en|en|wav/p312_342.wav|||That was the biggest game of my life.|
032446|312-en|en|wav/p312_343.wav|||This is perfectly legal.|
032447|312-en|en|wav/p312_344.wav|||That's the most important thing for me.|
032448|312-en|en|wav/p312_345.wav|||Then came the second round.|
032449|312-en|en|wav/p312_346.wav|||Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.|
032450|312-en|en|wav/p312_347.wav|||Saddam is not threatening this country.|
032451|312-en|en|wav/p312_348.wav|||We told them in June.|
032452|312-en|en|wav/p312_349.wav|||Parents should avoid it.|
032453|312-en|en|wav/p312_350.wav|||It was not a difficult decision, he said.|
032454|312-en|en|wav/p312_351.wav|||It was a horrible thing to happen.|
032455|312-en|en|wav/p312_352.wav|||And she's not even in the book!|
032456|312-en|en|wav/p312_353.wav|||Of course it's a bunch of trouble.|
032457|312-en|en|wav/p312_354.wav|||I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.|
032458|312-en|en|wav/p312_355.wav|||He, too, is killing.|
032459|312-en|en|wav/p312_356.wav|||Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.|
032460|312-en|en|wav/p312_357.wav|||It's better to be happy.|
032461|312-en|en|wav/p312_358.wav|||It's just so sad.|
032462|312-en|en|wav/p312_359.wav|||We have lost the round, but not the fight.|
032463|312-en|en|wav/p312_360.wav|||And Scotland is no different.|
032464|312-en|en|wav/p312_361.wav|||It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.|
032465|312-en|en|wav/p312_362.wav|||We are in a learning curve.|
032466|312-en|en|wav/p312_363.wav|||He can do everything.|
032467|312-en|en|wav/p312_364.wav|||She was just that sort of person.|
032468|312-en|en|wav/p312_365.wav|||Is it a warning to parents?|
032469|312-en|en|wav/p312_366.wav|||You've gotten all the facts.|
032470|312-en|en|wav/p312_367.wav|||And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.|
032471|312-en|en|wav/p312_368.wav|||Soon the whole country will be level.|
032472|312-en|en|wav/p312_369.wav|||And huge, indeed, it is.|
032473|312-en|en|wav/p312_370.wav|||I'm not interested in coming up with answers.|
032474|312-en|en|wav/p312_371.wav|||Attack appears to be the biggest concern.|
032475|312-en|en|wav/p312_372.wav|||For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|
032476|312-en|en|wav/p312_373.wav|||He said he needed no more evidence.|
032477|312-en|en|wav/p312_374.wav|||It's such a tragedy.|
032478|312-en|en|wav/p312_375.wav|||It was a long time coming.|
032479|312-en|en|wav/p312_376.wav|||Gordon Brown was superb.|
032480|312-en|en|wav/p312_377.wav|||The referee didn't do his job.|
032481|312-en|en|wav/p312_378.wav|||We are very nearly there.|
032482|312-en|en|wav/p312_379.wav|||Stand by for action.|
032483|312-en|en|wav/p312_380.wav|||Barry will be able to handle this.|
032484|312-en|en|wav/p312_381.wav|||However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.|
032485|312-en|en|wav/p312_382.wav|||The urgency is real.|
032486|312-en|en|wav/p312_383.wav|||They have been for some time now.|
032487|312-en|en|wav/p312_384.wav|||It was only logical to end it.|
032488|312-en|en|wav/p312_385.wav|||Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.|
032489|312-en|en|wav/p312_386.wav|||I've no passion for any country.|
032490|312-en|en|wav/p312_387.wav|||Scotland needs to hear it, too.|
032491|312-en|en|wav/p312_388.wav|||Nobody ever gets to see them.|
032492|312-en|en|wav/p312_389.wav|||That's an old idea.|
032493|312-en|en|wav/p312_390.wav|||It is part and parcel of it.|
032494|312-en|en|wav/p312_391.wav|||The only safe investment is cash.|
032495|312-en|en|wav/p312_392.wav|||It's the whole season.|
032496|312-en|en|wav/p312_393.wav|||We had no choice but to go down.|
032497|312-en|en|wav/p312_394.wav|||We are keen to have him back.|
032498|312-en|en|wav/p312_395.wav|||This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.|
032499|312-en|en|wav/p312_396.wav|||Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.|
032500|312-en|en|wav/p312_397.wav|||And we all understand that.|
032501|312-en|en|wav/p312_398.wav|||The new incitement offence will cover all religions.|
032502|312-en|en|wav/p312_399.wav|||Clearly, the future remains uncertain.|
032503|312-en|en|wav/p312_400.wav|||Do what you have to do.|
032504|312-en|en|wav/p312_401.wav|||We must do well in that.|
032505|312-en|en|wav/p312_402.wav|||She died later on Monday.|
032506|312-en|en|wav/p312_403.wav|||No-one has yet been charged.|
032507|312-en|en|wav/p312_404.wav|||If so, they were wrong.|
032508|312-en|en|wav/p312_405.wav|||This is my big break.|
032509|312-en|en|wav/p312_406.wav|||It was meant to rival the dollar.|
032510|312-en|en|wav/p312_407.wav|||There is no easy answer.|
032511|312-en|en|wav/p312_408.wav|||There was someone on the floor.|
032512|312-en|en|wav/p312_409.wav|||I put pressure on him.|
032513|312-en|en|wav/p312_410.wav|||He supported the decision to review the decision.|
032514|312-en|en|wav/p312_411.wav|||It was chaotic and frightening.|
032515|312-en|en|wav/p312_412.wav|||Friday night was a pretty good night.|
032516|312-en|en|wav/p312_413.wav|||He will never walk the streets again.|
032517|312-en|en|wav/p312_414.wav|||The proposals have been taken out of context.|
032518|312-en|en|wav/p312_415.wav|||Golf has lost a great character.|
032519|312-en|en|wav/p312_416.wav|||However, it has had only a limited uptake.|
032520|312-en|en|wav/p312_417.wav|||I have to say, for me, the game was not.|
032521|312-en|en|wav/p312_418.wav|||However, the report was incorrect.|
032522|312-en|en|wav/p312_419.wav|||There was no pressure at all.|
032523|313-en|en|wav/p313_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
032524|313-en|en|wav/p313_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
032525|313-en|en|wav/p313_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
032526|313-en|en|wav/p313_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
032527|313-en|en|wav/p313_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
032528|313-en|en|wav/p313_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
032529|313-en|en|wav/p313_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032530|313-en|en|wav/p313_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032531|313-en|en|wav/p313_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032532|313-en|en|wav/p313_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032533|313-en|en|wav/p313_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
032534|313-en|en|wav/p313_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032535|313-en|en|wav/p313_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032536|313-en|en|wav/p313_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
032537|313-en|en|wav/p313_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
032538|313-en|en|wav/p313_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
032539|313-en|en|wav/p313_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032540|313-en|en|wav/p313_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032541|313-en|en|wav/p313_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032542|313-en|en|wav/p313_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
032543|313-en|en|wav/p313_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.|
032544|313-en|en|wav/p313_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032545|313-en|en|wav/p313_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
032546|313-en|en|wav/p313_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
032547|313-en|en|wav/p313_025.wav|||They will be dealt with.|
032548|313-en|en|wav/p313_026.wav|||It is never an easy game.|
032549|313-en|en|wav/p313_027.wav|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
032550|313-en|en|wav/p313_028.wav|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
032551|313-en|en|wav/p313_029.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
032552|313-en|en|wav/p313_030.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
032553|313-en|en|wav/p313_031.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
032554|313-en|en|wav/p313_032.wav|||It was important to win the singles.|
032555|313-en|en|wav/p313_033.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
032556|313-en|en|wav/p313_034.wav|||That is impressive by any standards.|
032557|313-en|en|wav/p313_035.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
032558|313-en|en|wav/p313_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
032559|313-en|en|wav/p313_037.wav|||This was the performance, and the result they needed.|
032560|313-en|en|wav/p313_038.wav|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
032561|313-en|en|wav/p313_039.wav|||It helped me to get noticed.|
032562|313-en|en|wav/p313_040.wav|||They hit me in the head.|
032563|313-en|en|wav/p313_041.wav|||But he is not using them.|
032564|313-en|en|wav/p313_042.wav|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
032565|313-en|en|wav/p313_043.wav|||We are not moving in.|
032566|313-en|en|wav/p313_044.wav|||We have not had a formal request.|
032567|313-en|en|wav/p313_045.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
032568|313-en|en|wav/p313_046.wav|||Its effect on humans is not yet known.|
032569|313-en|en|wav/p313_047.wav|||We offered something different.|
032570|313-en|en|wav/p313_048.wav|||We were very much a happy family.|
032571|313-en|en|wav/p313_049.wav|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
032572|313-en|en|wav/p313_050.wav|||My brother's buried under there.|
032573|313-en|en|wav/p313_051.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
032574|313-en|en|wav/p313_052.wav|||What were they?|
032575|313-en|en|wav/p313_053.wav|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
032576|313-en|en|wav/p313_054.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
032577|313-en|en|wav/p313_055.wav|||Her role in it was small.|
032578|313-en|en|wav/p313_056.wav|||I've really noticed that this week.|
032579|313-en|en|wav/p313_057.wav|||We might be back next year.|
032580|313-en|en|wav/p313_058.wav|||In a way he was.|
032581|313-en|en|wav/p313_059.wav|||It's back to how it used to be.|
032582|313-en|en|wav/p313_060.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
032583|313-en|en|wav/p313_061.wav|||The firm was down and almost out.|
032584|313-en|en|wav/p313_062.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
032585|313-en|en|wav/p313_063.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
032586|313-en|en|wav/p313_064.wav|||I learned a lot from that.|
032587|313-en|en|wav/p313_065.wav|||The house was so well alight.|
032588|313-en|en|wav/p313_066.wav|||He got his degree.|
032589|313-en|en|wav/p313_067.wav|||Sandy was very active.|
032590|313-en|en|wav/p313_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
032591|313-en|en|wav/p313_069.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
032592|313-en|en|wav/p313_070.wav|||I'm confident of the outcome this week.|
032593|313-en|en|wav/p313_071.wav|||There were no formal announcements.|
032594|313-en|en|wav/p313_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
032595|313-en|en|wav/p313_073.wav|||It really has left the town in shock.|
032596|313-en|en|wav/p313_074.wav|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
032597|313-en|en|wav/p313_075.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
032598|313-en|en|wav/p313_076.wav|||This was much worse.|
032599|313-en|en|wav/p313_077.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
032600|313-en|en|wav/p313_078.wav|||We are confident of taking that back.|
032601|313-en|en|wav/p313_079.wav|||They must be kept on the ground.|
032602|313-en|en|wav/p313_080.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
032603|313-en|en|wav/p313_081.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
032604|313-en|en|wav/p313_082.wav|||This does not help.|
032605|313-en|en|wav/p313_083.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
032606|313-en|en|wav/p313_084.wav|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
032607|313-en|en|wav/p313_085.wav|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
032608|313-en|en|wav/p313_086.wav|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
032609|313-en|en|wav/p313_087.wav|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
032610|313-en|en|wav/p313_088.wav|||This could be her way forward.|
032611|313-en|en|wav/p313_089.wav|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
032612|313-en|en|wav/p313_090.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
032613|313-en|en|wav/p313_091.wav|||It's a very, very special day.|
032614|313-en|en|wav/p313_092.wav|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
032615|313-en|en|wav/p313_093.wav|||There's also the point.|
032616|313-en|en|wav/p313_094.wav|||It was forced to divert.|
032617|313-en|en|wav/p313_095.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
032618|313-en|en|wav/p313_096.wav|||That's the National Grid.|
032619|313-en|en|wav/p313_097.wav|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
032620|313-en|en|wav/p313_098.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|
032621|313-en|en|wav/p313_099.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
032622|313-en|en|wav/p313_100.wav|||They've just got to believe in themselves.|
032623|313-en|en|wav/p313_101.wav|||This is my personal assessment.|
032624|313-en|en|wav/p313_102.wav|||There was no trouble at all.|
032625|313-en|en|wav/p313_103.wav|||Although, you never know.|
032626|313-en|en|wav/p313_104.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
032627|313-en|en|wav/p313_105.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
032628|313-en|en|wav/p313_106.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
032629|313-en|en|wav/p313_107.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
032630|313-en|en|wav/p313_108.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
032631|313-en|en|wav/p313_109.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
032632|313-en|en|wav/p313_110.wav|||I took the gun.|
032633|313-en|en|wav/p313_111.wav|||It's just one of those things.|
032634|313-en|en|wav/p313_112.wav|||A web site is planned for November.|
032635|313-en|en|wav/p313_113.wav|||We played so well at times.|
032636|313-en|en|wav/p313_114.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
032637|313-en|en|wav/p313_115.wav|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
032638|313-en|en|wav/p313_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
032639|313-en|en|wav/p313_117.wav|||They will be destroyed.|
032640|313-en|en|wav/p313_118.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
032641|313-en|en|wav/p313_119.wav|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
032642|313-en|en|wav/p313_120.wav|||The Tory party will last.|
032643|313-en|en|wav/p313_121.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
032644|313-en|en|wav/p313_122.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
032645|313-en|en|wav/p313_123.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
032646|313-en|en|wav/p313_124.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
032647|313-en|en|wav/p313_125.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
032648|313-en|en|wav/p313_126.wav|||What's the point?|
032649|313-en|en|wav/p313_127.wav|||Why is this?|
032650|313-en|en|wav/p313_128.wav|||What has changed since then?|
032651|313-en|en|wav/p313_129.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
032652|313-en|en|wav/p313_130.wav|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
032653|313-en|en|wav/p313_131.wav|||I'd love to be at the World Cup.|
032654|313-en|en|wav/p313_132.wav|||He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|
032655|313-en|en|wav/p313_133.wav|||I'm sorry to hear this news.|
032656|313-en|en|wav/p313_134.wav|||At some point, the bill will be presented.|
032657|313-en|en|wav/p313_135.wav|||I mean it happens.|
032658|313-en|en|wav/p313_136.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
032659|313-en|en|wav/p313_137.wav|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
032660|313-en|en|wav/p313_138.wav|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
032661|313-en|en|wav/p313_139.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
032662|313-en|en|wav/p313_140.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
032663|313-en|en|wav/p313_141.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
032664|313-en|en|wav/p313_142.wav|||It's typical of me.|
032665|313-en|en|wav/p313_143.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
032666|313-en|en|wav/p313_144.wav|||They played it like a cup final.|
032667|313-en|en|wav/p313_145.wav|||However, it's not all bad news for women.|
032668|313-en|en|wav/p313_146.wav|||But the championship is not over yet.|
032669|313-en|en|wav/p313_147.wav|||We haven't found out anything different.|
032670|313-en|en|wav/p313_148.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
032671|313-en|en|wav/p313_149.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
032672|313-en|en|wav/p313_150.wav|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
032673|313-en|en|wav/p313_151.wav|||Surely it can do better than that?|
032674|313-en|en|wav/p313_152.wav|||I am ashamed of them.|
032675|313-en|en|wav/p313_153.wav|||Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|
032676|313-en|en|wav/p313_154.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
032677|313-en|en|wav/p313_155.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
032678|313-en|en|wav/p313_156.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
032679|313-en|en|wav/p313_157.wav|||I'm not blaming audiences.|
032680|313-en|en|wav/p313_158.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
032681|313-en|en|wav/p313_159.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
032682|313-en|en|wav/p313_160.wav|||He'd never run the distance before.|
032683|313-en|en|wav/p313_161.wav|||I can make one further announcement.|
032684|313-en|en|wav/p313_162.wav|||The General Election is all to play for.|
032685|313-en|en|wav/p313_163.wav|||It was a fiery game.|
032686|313-en|en|wav/p313_164.wav|||Agents and coaches must be paid.|
032687|313-en|en|wav/p313_165.wav|||Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|
032688|313-en|en|wav/p313_166.wav|||Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|
032689|313-en|en|wav/p313_167.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
032690|313-en|en|wav/p313_168.wav|||This one is a special case.|
032691|313-en|en|wav/p313_169.wav|||But what are the songs about?|
032692|313-en|en|wav/p313_170.wav|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
032693|313-en|en|wav/p313_171.wav|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
032694|313-en|en|wav/p313_172.wav|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
032695|313-en|en|wav/p313_173.wav|||The stadium was full.|
032696|313-en|en|wav/p313_174.wav|||Dewar is the medium.|
032697|313-en|en|wav/p313_175.wav|||It was that kind of night.|
032698|313-en|en|wav/p313_176.wav|||It is very much a matter for them.|
032699|313-en|en|wav/p313_177.wav|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
032700|313-en|en|wav/p313_178.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
032701|313-en|en|wav/p313_179.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
032702|313-en|en|wav/p313_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
032703|313-en|en|wav/p313_181.wav|||I hope we do.|
032704|313-en|en|wav/p313_182.wav|||From now on there is no hiding place.|
032705|313-en|en|wav/p313_183.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
032706|313-en|en|wav/p313_184.wav|||He quit in October.|
032707|313-en|en|wav/p313_185.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
032708|313-en|en|wav/p313_186.wav|||Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|
032709|313-en|en|wav/p313_187.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
032710|313-en|en|wav/p313_188.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
032711|313-en|en|wav/p313_189.wav|||They were that poor.|
032712|313-en|en|wav/p313_190.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
032713|313-en|en|wav/p313_191.wav|||We have understood the problems for some time.|
032714|313-en|en|wav/p313_192.wav|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
032715|313-en|en|wav/p313_193.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
032716|313-en|en|wav/p313_194.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
032717|313-en|en|wav/p313_195.wav|||They believed it worked.|
032718|313-en|en|wav/p313_196.wav|||After that, though, we're still waiting to see.|
032719|313-en|en|wav/p313_197.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
032720|313-en|en|wav/p313_198.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
032721|313-en|en|wav/p313_199.wav|||So they will settle again.|
032722|313-en|en|wav/p313_200.wav|||How do we get more people in?|
032723|313-en|en|wav/p313_201.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
032724|313-en|en|wav/p313_202.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
032725|313-en|en|wav/p313_203.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
032726|313-en|en|wav/p313_204.wav|||Election results are expected soon.|
032727|313-en|en|wav/p313_205.wav|||So she told him.|
032728|313-en|en|wav/p313_206.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
032729|313-en|en|wav/p313_207.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
032730|313-en|en|wav/p313_208.wav|||It was good to score the goal today.|
032731|313-en|en|wav/p313_209.wav|||The night is young.|
032732|313-en|en|wav/p313_210.wav|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
032733|313-en|en|wav/p313_211.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
032734|313-en|en|wav/p313_212.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
032735|313-en|en|wav/p313_213.wav|||The squad will be the same for France.|
032736|313-en|en|wav/p313_214.wav|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
032737|313-en|en|wav/p313_215.wav|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
032738|313-en|en|wav/p313_216.wav|||We're still paying the price for that.|
032739|313-en|en|wav/p313_217.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
032740|313-en|en|wav/p313_218.wav|||It's not a wish list.|
032741|313-en|en|wav/p313_219.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
032742|313-en|en|wav/p313_220.wav|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
032743|313-en|en|wav/p313_221.wav|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
032744|313-en|en|wav/p313_222.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
032745|313-en|en|wav/p313_223.wav|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
032746|313-en|en|wav/p313_224.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
032747|313-en|en|wav/p313_225.wav|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
032748|313-en|en|wav/p313_226.wav|||From our point of view, it's the right time.|
032749|313-en|en|wav/p313_227.wav|||That figure will always remain with me.|
032750|313-en|en|wav/p313_228.wav|||And then a funny thing happened.|
032751|313-en|en|wav/p313_229.wav|||It doesn't take much.|
032752|313-en|en|wav/p313_230.wav|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
032753|313-en|en|wav/p313_231.wav|||It was a stunning strike.|
032754|313-en|en|wav/p313_232.wav|||It is a technique.|
032755|313-en|en|wav/p313_233.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
032756|313-en|en|wav/p313_234.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
032757|313-en|en|wav/p313_235.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
032758|313-en|en|wav/p313_236.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
032759|313-en|en|wav/p313_237.wav|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
032760|313-en|en|wav/p313_238.wav|||There is nothing to fear.|
032761|313-en|en|wav/p313_239.wav|||I was an athlete.|
032762|313-en|en|wav/p313_240.wav|||Life was like a timetable.|
032763|313-en|en|wav/p313_241.wav|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
032764|313-en|en|wav/p313_242.wav|||I tried to push him away.|
032765|313-en|en|wav/p313_243.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
032766|313-en|en|wav/p313_244.wav|||This was done by the council staff.|
032767|313-en|en|wav/p313_245.wav|||The truth is otherwise.|
032768|313-en|en|wav/p313_246.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
032769|313-en|en|wav/p313_247.wav|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
032770|313-en|en|wav/p313_248.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
032771|313-en|en|wav/p313_249.wav|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
032772|313-en|en|wav/p313_250.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
032773|313-en|en|wav/p313_251.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
032774|313-en|en|wav/p313_252.wav|||The man became a reporter.|
032775|313-en|en|wav/p313_253.wav|||It is a memorial.|
032776|313-en|en|wav/p313_254.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
032777|313-en|en|wav/p313_255.wav|||Our people are paying high prices.|
032778|313-en|en|wav/p313_256.wav|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
032779|313-en|en|wav/p313_257.wav|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
032780|313-en|en|wav/p313_258.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
032781|313-en|en|wav/p313_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
032782|313-en|en|wav/p313_260.wav|||I read it every year.|
032783|313-en|en|wav/p313_261.wav|||He was in contention almost every week.|
032784|313-en|en|wav/p313_262.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
032785|313-en|en|wav/p313_263.wav|||It's up to Ann.|
032786|313-en|en|wav/p313_264.wav|||We are playing them at their own game.|
032787|313-en|en|wav/p313_265.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
032788|313-en|en|wav/p313_266.wav|||I had trouble with the producers.|
032789|313-en|en|wav/p313_267.wav|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
032790|313-en|en|wav/p313_268.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
032791|313-en|en|wav/p313_269.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
032792|313-en|en|wav/p313_270.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
032793|313-en|en|wav/p313_271.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|
032794|313-en|en|wav/p313_272.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
032795|313-en|en|wav/p313_273.wav|||There is no more money.|
032796|313-en|en|wav/p313_274.wav|||My mother is a widow.|
032797|313-en|en|wav/p313_275.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
032798|313-en|en|wav/p313_276.wav|||There have been different reports from different people.|
032799|313-en|en|wav/p313_277.wav|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
032800|313-en|en|wav/p313_278.wav|||Something was plainly wrong.|
032801|313-en|en|wav/p313_279.wav|||Why should he go anywhere?|
032802|313-en|en|wav/p313_280.wav|||One thing is sure.|
032803|313-en|en|wav/p313_281.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
032804|313-en|en|wav/p313_282.wav|||I'm confident we can do that.|
032805|313-en|en|wav/p313_283.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
032806|313-en|en|wav/p313_284.wav|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
032807|313-en|en|wav/p313_285.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
032808|313-en|en|wav/p313_286.wav|||We're talking about the outskirts of London.|
032809|313-en|en|wav/p313_287.wav|||The end result is precisely the same.|
032810|313-en|en|wav/p313_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
032811|313-en|en|wav/p313_289.wav|||I'm not a threat to coaches.|
032812|313-en|en|wav/p313_290.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
032813|313-en|en|wav/p313_291.wav|||It's never over until it's over.|
032814|313-en|en|wav/p313_292.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
032815|313-en|en|wav/p313_293.wav|||This year, it was a little different.|
032816|313-en|en|wav/p313_294.wav|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
032817|313-en|en|wav/p313_295.wav|||We gave them the goal.|
032818|313-en|en|wav/p313_296.wav|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
032819|313-en|en|wav/p313_297.wav|||What's the point of staying sober?|
032820|313-en|en|wav/p313_298.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
032821|313-en|en|wav/p313_299.wav|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
032822|313-en|en|wav/p313_300.wav|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
032823|313-en|en|wav/p313_301.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
032824|313-en|en|wav/p313_302.wav|||I can feel the sound inside.|
032825|313-en|en|wav/p313_303.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
032826|313-en|en|wav/p313_304.wav|||I'm not a fan of books.|
032827|313-en|en|wav/p313_305.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
032828|313-en|en|wav/p313_306.wav|||It may well have been.|
032829|313-en|en|wav/p313_307.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
032830|313-en|en|wav/p313_308.wav|||It was a simple question.|
032831|313-en|en|wav/p313_309.wav|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
032832|313-en|en|wav/p313_310.wav|||And we've beaten them before.|
032833|313-en|en|wav/p313_311.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
032834|313-en|en|wav/p313_312.wav|||I'm not a paedophile.|
032835|313-en|en|wav/p313_313.wav|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
032836|313-en|en|wav/p313_314.wav|||But they had to be paid for.|
032837|313-en|en|wav/p313_315.wav|||The odds are that it will.|
032838|313-en|en|wav/p313_316.wav|||But then they scored their fourth.|
032839|313-en|en|wav/p313_317.wav|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
032840|313-en|en|wav/p313_318.wav|||That's the position that the MoD has adopted.|
032841|313-en|en|wav/p313_319.wav|||Why is that?|
032842|313-en|en|wav/p313_320.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
032843|313-en|en|wav/p313_321.wav|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
032844|313-en|en|wav/p313_322.wav|||But will they fall in love?|
032845|313-en|en|wav/p313_323.wav|||As if they ever stopped.|
032846|313-en|en|wav/p313_324.wav|||The referee had a shocking game.|
032847|313-en|en|wav/p313_325.wav|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
032848|313-en|en|wav/p313_326.wav|||For a few years we had good fun.|
032849|313-en|en|wav/p313_327.wav|||Medical staff are with them at the moment.|
032850|313-en|en|wav/p313_328.wav|||It went on to become an annual event.|
032851|313-en|en|wav/p313_329.wav|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
032852|313-en|en|wav/p313_330.wav|||We are now in an election period.|
032853|313-en|en|wav/p313_331.wav|||Everyone's too upset to comment.|
032854|313-en|en|wav/p313_332.wav|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
032855|313-en|en|wav/p313_333.wav|||But when we do it is great.|
032856|313-en|en|wav/p313_334.wav|||She has nothing to say to journalists.|
032857|313-en|en|wav/p313_335.wav|||I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|
032858|313-en|en|wav/p313_336.wav|||He pleaded for caution.|
032859|313-en|en|wav/p313_339.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
032860|313-en|en|wav/p313_340.wav|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
032861|313-en|en|wav/p313_341.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
032862|313-en|en|wav/p313_342.wav|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
032863|313-en|en|wav/p313_343.wav|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
032864|313-en|en|wav/p313_344.wav|||It's a question of perception.|
032865|313-en|en|wav/p313_345.wav|||Staff have been informed.|
032866|313-en|en|wav/p313_346.wav|||My heart is not so sure.|
032867|313-en|en|wav/p313_347.wav|||This morning was very quiet.|
032868|313-en|en|wav/p313_348.wav|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
032869|313-en|en|wav/p313_349.wav|||It's been handled entirely properly.|
032870|313-en|en|wav/p313_350.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
032871|313-en|en|wav/p313_351.wav|||That might help a bit.|
032872|313-en|en|wav/p313_352.wav|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
032873|313-en|en|wav/p313_353.wav|||He was made redundant in February of last year.|
032874|313-en|en|wav/p313_354.wav|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
032875|313-en|en|wav/p313_355.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
032876|313-en|en|wav/p313_356.wav|||You've obviously got an answer to it.|
032877|313-en|en|wav/p313_357.wav|||It seems very odd.|
032878|313-en|en|wav/p313_358.wav|||Closure is not one of them.|
032879|313-en|en|wav/p313_359.wav|||The hotel was huge.|
032880|313-en|en|wav/p313_360.wav|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
032881|313-en|en|wav/p313_361.wav|||Well, you can have a tree.|
032882|313-en|en|wav/p313_362.wav|||It was the same at Twickenham.|
032883|313-en|en|wav/p313_363.wav|||This is an internal matter.|
032884|313-en|en|wav/p313_364.wav|||I'm amazed at what he's done.|
032885|313-en|en|wav/p313_365.wav|||They took a risk.|
032886|313-en|en|wav/p313_366.wav|||The idea was presented to me.|
032887|313-en|en|wav/p313_367.wav|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
032888|313-en|en|wav/p313_368.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
032889|313-en|en|wav/p313_369.wav|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
032890|313-en|en|wav/p313_370.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
032891|313-en|en|wav/p313_371.wav|||I see it as my job.|
032892|313-en|en|wav/p313_372.wav|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
032893|313-en|en|wav/p313_373.wav|||Frank Warren is a great man.|
032894|313-en|en|wav/p313_374.wav|||I'm a little bit tired.|
032895|313-en|en|wav/p313_375.wav|||That was never their agenda.|
032896|313-en|en|wav/p313_376.wav|||She died at her home.|
032897|313-en|en|wav/p313_377.wav|||She's currently in foster care.|
032898|313-en|en|wav/p313_378.wav|||That's the only thing that matters.|
032899|313-en|en|wav/p313_379.wav|||I enjoy the creative process.|
032900|313-en|en|wav/p313_380.wav|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
032901|313-en|en|wav/p313_381.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
032902|313-en|en|wav/p313_382.wav|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
032903|313-en|en|wav/p313_383.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
032904|313-en|en|wav/p313_384.wav|||We have been preparing all year.|
032905|313-en|en|wav/p313_385.wav|||We could learn a lot from them.|
032906|313-en|en|wav/p313_386.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
032907|313-en|en|wav/p313_387.wav|||Sure, we have problems.|
032908|313-en|en|wav/p313_388.wav|||I was released after six days.|
032909|313-en|en|wav/p313_389.wav|||That time is not far away.|
032910|313-en|en|wav/p313_390.wav|||I may think about performing it.|
032911|313-en|en|wav/p313_391.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
032912|313-en|en|wav/p313_392.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
032913|313-en|en|wav/p313_393.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
032914|313-en|en|wav/p313_394.wav|||You can't go back and change things.|
032915|313-en|en|wav/p313_395.wav|||It's time to fight a decisive battle.|
032916|313-en|en|wav/p313_396.wav|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
032917|313-en|en|wav/p313_397.wav|||Instead, it's back to the drawing board.|
032918|313-en|en|wav/p313_398.wav|||He says it often enough.|
032919|313-en|en|wav/p313_399.wav|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
032920|313-en|en|wav/p313_400.wav|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
032921|313-en|en|wav/p313_401.wav|||I found that much more challenging.|
032922|313-en|en|wav/p313_402.wav|||This fight is not going to go away.|
032923|313-en|en|wav/p313_403.wav|||It would have been very easily done.|
032924|313-en|en|wav/p313_404.wav|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
032925|313-en|en|wav/p313_405.wav|||The Open champion is back.|
032926|313-en|en|wav/p313_406.wav|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
032927|313-en|en|wav/p313_407.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
032928|313-en|en|wav/p313_408.wav|||I want to keep him.|
032929|313-en|en|wav/p313_409.wav|||He deserves a top team.|
032930|313-en|en|wav/p313_410.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
032931|313-en|en|wav/p313_411.wav|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
032932|313-en|en|wav/p313_412.wav|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
032933|313-en|en|wav/p313_413.wav|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
032934|313-en|en|wav/p313_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
032935|313-en|en|wav/p313_415.wav|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
032936|313-en|en|wav/p313_416.wav|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
032937|313-en|en|wav/p313_417.wav|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
032938|313-en|en|wav/p313_418.wav|||Would they work together again?|
032939|313-en|en|wav/p313_419.wav|||I didn't play all that well.|
032940|313-en|en|wav/p313_420.wav|||Who can tell?|
032941|313-en|en|wav/p313_421.wav|||It appears to have been closed down.|
032942|313-en|en|wav/p313_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
032943|313-en|en|wav/p313_423.wav|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
032944|314-en|en|wav/p314_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
032945|314-en|en|wav/p314_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
032946|314-en|en|wav/p314_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
032947|314-en|en|wav/p314_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
032948|314-en|en|wav/p314_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
032949|314-en|en|wav/p314_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
032950|314-en|en|wav/p314_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032951|314-en|en|wav/p314_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032952|314-en|en|wav/p314_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032953|314-en|en|wav/p314_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032954|314-en|en|wav/p314_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
032955|314-en|en|wav/p314_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032956|314-en|en|wav/p314_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032957|314-en|en|wav/p314_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
032958|314-en|en|wav/p314_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
032959|314-en|en|wav/p314_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
032960|314-en|en|wav/p314_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032961|314-en|en|wav/p314_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032962|314-en|en|wav/p314_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032963|314-en|en|wav/p314_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
032964|314-en|en|wav/p314_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
032965|314-en|en|wav/p314_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032967|314-en|en|wav/p314_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
032968|314-en|en|wav/p314_025.wav|||The Scots are, however, in good company.|
032969|314-en|en|wav/p314_026.wav|||He was born in London of Scottish parents.|
032970|314-en|en|wav/p314_027.wav|||Her condition last night was described as critical.|
032971|314-en|en|wav/p314_028.wav|||Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|
032972|314-en|en|wav/p314_029.wav|||Four other charges were dropped.|
032973|314-en|en|wav/p314_030.wav|||I believe in the Church.|
032974|314-en|en|wav/p314_031.wav|||We are just being flooded.|
032975|314-en|en|wav/p314_032.wav|||It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|
032976|314-en|en|wav/p314_033.wav|||They tend to be easily influenced by others.|
032977|314-en|en|wav/p314_034.wav|||It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.|
032978|314-en|en|wav/p314_035.wav|||Well, what do you know?|
032979|314-en|en|wav/p314_036.wav|||But she was very human.|
032980|314-en|en|wav/p314_037.wav|||There are some serious ethical issues involved.|
032981|314-en|en|wav/p314_038.wav|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
032982|314-en|en|wav/p314_039.wav|||His concern is only for the future.|
032983|314-en|en|wav/p314_040.wav|||We have reacted well to each other.|
032984|314-en|en|wav/p314_041.wav|||Pupils and staff were sent home early.|
032985|314-en|en|wav/p314_042.wav|||It is all about people being assaulted, abused.|
032986|314-en|en|wav/p314_043.wav|||I'm delighted with how he has come through.|
032987|314-en|en|wav/p314_044.wav|||In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.|
032988|314-en|en|wav/p314_045.wav|||He will emerge as a world leader.|
032989|314-en|en|wav/p314_046.wav|||That view has not altered.|
032990|314-en|en|wav/p314_047.wav|||I only half believe it.|
032991|314-en|en|wav/p314_048.wav|||It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|
032992|314-en|en|wav/p314_049.wav|||All the oil companies are talking together.|
032993|314-en|en|wav/p314_050.wav|||We have no choice but to shut down.|
032994|314-en|en|wav/p314_051.wav|||I'm feeling pretty good.|
032995|314-en|en|wav/p314_052.wav|||The prognosis is excellent.|
032996|314-en|en|wav/p314_053.wav|||Rangers deserved to beat us.|
032997|314-en|en|wav/p314_054.wav|||That, though, is the measure of the man.|
032998|314-en|en|wav/p314_055.wav|||It was developed in the Gulf War.|
032999|314-en|en|wav/p314_056.wav|||Sub Not Used, MacKay.|
033000|314-en|en|wav/p314_057.wav|||It is not normal practice.|
033001|314-en|en|wav/p314_058.wav|||But he just carried on anyway.|
033002|314-en|en|wav/p314_059.wav|||The spirit in the squad is certainly good.|
033003|314-en|en|wav/p314_060.wav|||What happens next?|
033004|314-en|en|wav/p314_061.wav|||I would not want to be young again.|
033005|314-en|en|wav/p314_062.wav|||Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|
033006|314-en|en|wav/p314_063.wav|||I'm astonished the men were not injured.|
033007|314-en|en|wav/p314_064.wav|||There are schoolboys in uniform.|
033008|314-en|en|wav/p314_065.wav|||Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|
033009|314-en|en|wav/p314_066.wav|||They were later discharged from hospital.|
033010|314-en|en|wav/p314_067.wav|||Let's see that increase over the years.|
033011|314-en|en|wav/p314_068.wav|||I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.|
033012|314-en|en|wav/p314_069.wav|||They knew they shouldn't have been there.|
033013|314-en|en|wav/p314_070.wav|||These findings would be made public.|
033014|314-en|en|wav/p314_071.wav|||It's the most beautiful place on earth.|
033015|314-en|en|wav/p314_072.wav|||I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|
033016|314-en|en|wav/p314_073.wav|||You can't go on forever.|
033017|314-en|en|wav/p314_074.wav|||All the lads are totally focused on that.|
033018|314-en|en|wav/p314_075.wav|||So far this season this approach is working.|
033019|314-en|en|wav/p314_076.wav|||I have got a knife.|
033020|314-en|en|wav/p314_077.wav|||If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|
033021|314-en|en|wav/p314_078.wav|||What did we learn?|
033022|314-en|en|wav/p314_079.wav|||I go home only once.|
033023|314-en|en|wav/p314_080.wav|||I'm not going to answer that right now.|
033024|314-en|en|wav/p314_081.wav|||It had a gigantic effect.|
033025|314-en|en|wav/p314_082.wav|||On that basis, he would set it aside.|
033026|314-en|en|wav/p314_083.wav|||I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|
033027|314-en|en|wav/p314_084.wav|||Bin Laden was not mentioned.|
033028|314-en|en|wav/p314_085.wav|||Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|
033029|314-en|en|wav/p314_086.wav|||The team this year is going places.|
033030|314-en|en|wav/p314_087.wav|||It opens the door to the Champions League.|
033031|314-en|en|wav/p314_088.wav|||We should do everything at a stroke.|
033032|314-en|en|wav/p314_089.wav|||He had a moustache.|
033033|314-en|en|wav/p314_090.wav|||He has changed my life for ever.|
033034|314-en|en|wav/p314_091.wav|||It plans to return to this field.|
033035|314-en|en|wav/p314_092.wav|||He said because people had invited him.|
033036|314-en|en|wav/p314_093.wav|||Action must be taken urgently.|
033037|314-en|en|wav/p314_094.wav|||They are completely different from each other.|
033038|314-en|en|wav/p314_095.wav|||The money is not really our concern.|
033039|314-en|en|wav/p314_096.wav|||Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|
033040|314-en|en|wav/p314_097.wav|||Correction, knowing him, he might.|
033041|314-en|en|wav/p314_098.wav|||I came up through the ranks.|
033042|314-en|en|wav/p314_099.wav|||Why does she suddenly win everything now?|
033043|314-en|en|wav/p314_100.wav|||His team management was protective.|
033044|314-en|en|wav/p314_101.wav|||He was the deputy editor at the paper.|
033045|314-en|en|wav/p314_102.wav|||The proposal was rejected.|
033046|314-en|en|wav/p314_103.wav|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
033047|314-en|en|wav/p314_104.wav|||We wanted it left for a wee while.|
033048|314-en|en|wav/p314_105.wav|||That would be even more disastrous.|
033049|314-en|en|wav/p314_106.wav|||These guys will not lie down.|
033050|314-en|en|wav/p314_107.wav|||You can expect a hell of a fuss.|
033051|314-en|en|wav/p314_108.wav|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
033052|314-en|en|wav/p314_109.wav|||That is nearly four people every day.|
033053|314-en|en|wav/p314_110.wav|||There are nine people here now.|
033054|314-en|en|wav/p314_111.wav|||Is my wife a racist?|
033055|314-en|en|wav/p314_112.wav|||It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|
033056|314-en|en|wav/p314_113.wav|||This would not be my first choice.|
033057|314-en|en|wav/p314_114.wav|||His wife Margaret was not in court.|
033058|314-en|en|wav/p314_115.wav|||Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|
033059|314-en|en|wav/p314_116.wav|||Which perhaps is just as well.|
033060|314-en|en|wav/p314_117.wav|||It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|
033061|314-en|en|wav/p314_118.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
033062|314-en|en|wav/p314_119.wav|||They have got their position, we have got our position.|
033063|314-en|en|wav/p314_120.wav|||That's not fair to the supporters.|
033064|314-en|en|wav/p314_121.wav|||I saw military vehicles in the distance.|
033065|314-en|en|wav/p314_122.wav|||But the killer remains at large.|
033066|314-en|en|wav/p314_123.wav|||It is a great shame.|
033067|314-en|en|wav/p314_124.wav|||There are a lot of examples.|
033068|314-en|en|wav/p314_125.wav|||But it will backfire.|
033069|314-en|en|wav/p314_126.wav|||But then he changed his mind.|
033070|314-en|en|wav/p314_127.wav|||I really hope he thinks that through.|
033071|314-en|en|wav/p314_128.wav|||Police were also perplexed.|
033072|314-en|en|wav/p314_129.wav|||For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|
033073|314-en|en|wav/p314_130.wav|||It's very tragic and traumatic.|
033074|314-en|en|wav/p314_131.wav|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
033075|314-en|en|wav/p314_132.wav|||That's a huge amount.|
033076|314-en|en|wav/p314_133.wav|||The final stage is paranoia.|
033077|314-en|en|wav/p314_134.wav|||I'm not holding the club to ransom.|
033078|314-en|en|wav/p314_135.wav|||Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.|
033079|314-en|en|wav/p314_136.wav|||Folk music is in her blood.|
033080|314-en|en|wav/p314_137.wav|||Pig farmers are completely despondent.|
033081|314-en|en|wav/p314_138.wav|||They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|
033082|314-en|en|wav/p314_139.wav|||We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.|
033083|314-en|en|wav/p314_140.wav|||I would love it.|
033084|314-en|en|wav/p314_141.wav|||This is the high point of my career.|
033085|314-en|en|wav/p314_142.wav|||That's the sort of game you want.|
033086|314-en|en|wav/p314_143.wav|||My duty is to win.|
033087|314-en|en|wav/p314_144.wav|||Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|
033088|314-en|en|wav/p314_145.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
033089|314-en|en|wav/p314_146.wav|||Now we look forward to it.|
033090|314-en|en|wav/p314_147.wav|||There is no such thing.|
033091|314-en|en|wav/p314_148.wav|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
033092|314-en|en|wav/p314_149.wav|||He was telling me to keep quiet.|
033093|314-en|en|wav/p314_150.wav|||It was a moment of madness.|
033094|314-en|en|wav/p314_151.wav|||Don't even bother applying.|
033095|314-en|en|wav/p314_152.wav|||But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|
033096|314-en|en|wav/p314_153.wav|||We like being the underdogs.|
033097|314-en|en|wav/p314_154.wav|||We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.|
033098|314-en|en|wav/p314_155.wav|||But we are not immune to the problem.|
033099|314-en|en|wav/p314_156.wav|||Racism has no place in any sport.|

033350|314-en|en|wav/p314_407.wav|||The review has been conducted fairly.|

033371|316-en|en|wav/p316_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
033372|316-en|en|wav/p316_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
033373|316-en|en|wav/p316_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033374|316-en|en|wav/p316_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033375|316-en|en|wav/p316_009.wav|||There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
033376|316-en|en|wav/p316_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
033377|316-en|en|wav/p316_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033378|316-en|en|wav/p316_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033379|316-en|en|wav/p316_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
033380|316-en|en|wav/p316_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
033381|316-en|en|wav/p316_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
033382|316-en|en|wav/p316_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
033383|316-en|en|wav/p316_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033384|316-en|en|wav/p316_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033385|316-en|en|wav/p316_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033386|316-en|en|wav/p316_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033387|316-en|en|wav/p316_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.|
033388|316-en|en|wav/p316_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033390|316-en|en|wav/p316_025.wav|||We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|
033391|316-en|en|wav/p316_026.wav|||Meetings will also remain private.|

033393|316-en|en|wav/p316_028.wav|||It's not going to work out that way.|
033394|316-en|en|wav/p316_029.wav|||We have worked hard.|
033395|316-en|en|wav/p316_030.wav|||After that, it's a step into the unknown.|
033396|316-en|en|wav/p316_031.wav|||Naturally, she said yes.|
033397|316-en|en|wav/p316_032.wav|||This is not a war on terror.|
033398|316-en|en|wav/p316_033.wav|||It is not for any other purpose.|
033399|316-en|en|wav/p316_034.wav|||There will always be problems on the way.|
033400|316-en|en|wav/p316_035.wav|||Why you did it will never be known.|
033401|316-en|en|wav/p316_036.wav|||He was in his element.|
033402|316-en|en|wav/p316_037.wav|||She is believed to be in South Africa.|
033403|316-en|en|wav/p316_038.wav|||What a week he has had.|
033404|316-en|en|wav/p316_039.wav|||We just want this season to end.|
033405|316-en|en|wav/p316_040.wav|||He is looking for a sporting challenge.|
033406|316-en|en|wav/p316_041.wav|||There is a new confidence about the club.|
033407|316-en|en|wav/p316_042.wav|||I accept that, but is very upsetting.|
033408|316-en|en|wav/p316_043.wav|||We accept the challenge.|
033409|316-en|en|wav/p316_044.wav|||The question is, Will it be enough?|
033410|316-en|en|wav/p316_045.wav|||After that it is up to the boss.|
033411|316-en|en|wav/p316_046.wav|||They were taken to prove a point.|
033412|316-en|en|wav/p316_047.wav|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
033413|316-en|en|wav/p316_048.wav|||And they removed a Borderer.|
033414|316-en|en|wav/p316_049.wav|||So, why does he do it?|
033415|316-en|en|wav/p316_050.wav|||I would love to have him home.|
033416|316-en|en|wav/p316_051.wav|||It is very unfair, and something should be done.|
033417|316-en|en|wav/p316_052.wav|||He had no enemies.|
033418|316-en|en|wav/p316_053.wav|||That is not the case this time.|
033419|316-en|en|wav/p316_054.wav|||We are going to New Broomfield to win.|
033420|316-en|en|wav/p316_055.wav|||But the law is very clear on this.|
033421|316-en|en|wav/p316_056.wav|||They treated me with respect and courtesy.|
033422|316-en|en|wav/p316_057.wav|||There was only silence.|
033423|316-en|en|wav/p316_058.wav|||However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.|
033424|316-en|en|wav/p316_059.wav|||It doesn't look as pretty.|
033425|316-en|en|wav/p316_060.wav|||However, our players will fight for that.|
033426|316-en|en|wav/p316_061.wav|||Everyone was very saddened.|
033427|316-en|en|wav/p316_062.wav|||He declined to give further details.|
033428|316-en|en|wav/p316_063.wav|||He said it was for sale.|
033429|316-en|en|wav/p316_064.wav|||This is a dream come true.|
033430|316-en|en|wav/p316_065.wav|||The problem is not confined to the UK.|
033431|316-en|en|wav/p316_066.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
033432|316-en|en|wav/p316_067.wav|||What on earth is wrong with you?|
033433|316-en|en|wav/p316_068.wav|||This is far too high.|
033434|316-en|en|wav/p316_069.wav|||We are still going ahead with our plans.|
033435|316-en|en|wav/p316_070.wav|||IS Tony Blair on drugs?|
033436|316-en|en|wav/p316_071.wav|||And if he hadn't become a musician?|
033437|316-en|en|wav/p316_072.wav|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
033438|316-en|en|wav/p316_073.wav|||He was also a great man.|
033439|316-en|en|wav/p316_074.wav|||We have a major concern about the enforcement action.|
033440|316-en|en|wav/p316_075.wav|||It is clear that change is required.|
033441|316-en|en|wav/p316_076.wav|||Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.|
033442|316-en|en|wav/p316_077.wav|||This is a big step up.|
033443|316-en|en|wav/p316_078.wav|||Robin Williams is subdued.|
033444|316-en|en|wav/p316_079.wav|||The judge was very nice.|

033446|316-en|en|wav/p316_081.wav|||The company yesterday refused to comment.|
033447|316-en|en|wav/p316_082.wav|||Most of them have already gone home.|
033448|316-en|en|wav/p316_083.wav|||Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.|
033449|316-en|en|wav/p316_084.wav|||Weaknesses there are, however.|
033450|316-en|en|wav/p316_085.wav|||It is, after all, a very funny play.|
033451|316-en|en|wav/p316_086.wav|||Can you imagine a world without design?|
033452|316-en|en|wav/p316_087.wav|||He was caught and fired.|
033453|316-en|en|wav/p316_088.wav|||I feel confident about the outcome.|
033454|316-en|en|wav/p316_089.wav|||The driver escaped injury.|

033456|316-en|en|wav/p316_091.wav|||There was no bad behaviour.|
033457|316-en|en|wav/p316_092.wav|||Today she has been released.|
033458|316-en|en|wav/p316_093.wav|||It's a much bigger problem.|
033459|316-en|en|wav/p316_094.wav|||There are no problems between us at all.|
033460|316-en|en|wav/p316_095.wav|||Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.|
033461|316-en|en|wav/p316_096.wav|||I've had it for the exams.|
033462|316-en|en|wav/p316_097.wav|||I hope it comes out all right.|
033463|316-en|en|wav/p316_098.wav|||I will just have to be patient.|
033464|316-en|en|wav/p316_099.wav|||It's a sensible management decision.|
033465|316-en|en|wav/p316_100.wav|||I kept it very simple.|
033466|316-en|en|wav/p316_101.wav|||The rest was badminton.|
033467|316-en|en|wav/p316_102.wav|||It will take several days.|
033468|316-en|en|wav/p316_103.wav|||We had to push to get a goal.|
033469|316-en|en|wav/p316_104.wav|||That got me out.|

033471|316-en|en|wav/p316_106.wav|||We are making progress on waiting lists.|
033472|316-en|en|wav/p316_107.wav|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
033473|316-en|en|wav/p316_108.wav|||I did not have faith in the procedures.|
033474|316-en|en|wav/p316_109.wav|||I was not a joiner.|
033475|316-en|en|wav/p316_110.wav|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
033476|316-en|en|wav/p316_111.wav|||Until you hit the big games.|
033477|316-en|en|wav/p316_112.wav|||It has until Saturday.|
033478|316-en|en|wav/p316_113.wav|||I've tried to get on with my life.|

033480|316-en|en|wav/p316_115.wav|||We will win this tie.|
033481|316-en|en|wav/p316_116.wav|||This is totally untrue.|
033482|316-en|en|wav/p316_117.wav|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
033483|316-en|en|wav/p316_118.wav|||I think they have to change that.|
033484|316-en|en|wav/p316_119.wav|||This series is for real.|
033485|316-en|en|wav/p316_120.wav|||It's great news, isn't it.|
033486|316-en|en|wav/p316_121.wav|||It's very ingenious.|
033487|316-en|en|wav/p316_122.wav|||That would depend on the parole board.|
033488|316-en|en|wav/p316_123.wav|||It is all up to the Members.|
033489|316-en|en|wav/p316_124.wav|||The two sets are different.|
033490|316-en|en|wav/p316_125.wav|||And now the pressure is off.|
033491|316-en|en|wav/p316_126.wav|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
033492|316-en|en|wav/p316_127.wav|||Their opening was disastrous.|
033493|316-en|en|wav/p316_128.wav|||The time is up for Iraq to comply.|
033494|316-en|en|wav/p316_129.wav|||There can be no compromise on that demand.|
033495|316-en|en|wav/p316_130.wav|||The following are the principal provisions.|
033496|316-en|en|wav/p316_131.wav|||Too much has already been said.|
033497|316-en|en|wav/p316_132.wav|||Now, however, things are different.|
033498|316-en|en|wav/p316_133.wav|||It was not a beautiful game, was it?|
033499|316-en|en|wav/p316_134.wav|||She is not the world champion.|
033500|316-en|en|wav/p316_135.wav|||It would be difficult to argue with that.|
033501|316-en|en|wav/p316_136.wav|||While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.|
033502|316-en|en|wav/p316_137.wav|||He is a bully.|
033503|316-en|en|wav/p316_138.wav|||The case was taken on by his brother.|
033504|316-en|en|wav/p316_139.wav|||I've won the British.|
033505|316-en|en|wav/p316_140.wav|||And so the cycle continues.|
033506|316-en|en|wav/p316_141.wav|||I don't have many friends.|
033507|316-en|en|wav/p316_142.wav|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
033508|316-en|en|wav/p316_143.wav|||They exist in name alone.|
033509|316-en|en|wav/p316_144.wav|||I am not retiring.|
033510|316-en|en|wav/p316_145.wav|||All will be revealed in due course.|
033511|316-en|en|wav/p316_146.wav|||In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|
033512|316-en|en|wav/p316_147.wav|||And frankly, it's been a while.|
033513|316-en|en|wav/p316_148.wav|||Feel for five seconds.|
033514|316-en|en|wav/p316_149.wav|||I hope it is a good omen.|
033515|316-en|en|wav/p316_150.wav|||Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.|
033516|316-en|en|wav/p316_151.wav|||They will appear again next week.|
033517|316-en|en|wav/p316_152.wav|||Failure is not an option.|
033518|316-en|en|wav/p316_153.wav|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
033519|316-en|en|wav/p316_154.wav|||You look at that.|
033520|316-en|en|wav/p316_155.wav|||Things begin to spring to life.|
033521|316-en|en|wav/p316_156.wav|||Or was it Some kind of a ham?|
033522|316-en|en|wav/p316_157.wav|||I understood that concern.|
033523|316-en|en|wav/p316_158.wav|||The things writers and directors say!|
033524|316-en|en|wav/p316_159.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
033525|316-en|en|wav/p316_160.wav|||It was like a dream to be here.|
033526|316-en|en|wav/p316_161.wav|||The four characters could be one somebody suggested.|
033527|316-en|en|wav/p316_162.wav|||Either way, it doesn't bother me.|
033528|316-en|en|wav/p316_163.wav|||It would help to heal the wounds.|
033529|316-en|en|wav/p316_164.wav|||We did not deserve to go through.|
033530|316-en|en|wav/p316_165.wav|||It's got to be in the head.|
033531|316-en|en|wav/p316_166.wav|||It certainly sounded it at times.|
033532|316-en|en|wav/p316_167.wav|||It will be too hot.|
033533|316-en|en|wav/p316_168.wav|||That happens in boxing.|
033534|316-en|en|wav/p316_169.wav|||Consumers will also benefit.|
033535|316-en|en|wav/p316_170.wav|||None of the opinions is good.|
033536|316-en|en|wav/p316_171.wav|||We were hopeful that it would be successful.|
033537|316-en|en|wav/p316_172.wav|||They must not succeed.|
033538|316-en|en|wav/p316_173.wav|||He declined to provide a breakdown.|
033539|316-en|en|wav/p316_174.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
033540|316-en|en|wav/p316_175.wav|||I have never seen him like that.|
033541|316-en|en|wav/p316_176.wav|||And you need to be so resourceful.|
033542|316-en|en|wav/p316_177.wav|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.|
033543|316-en|en|wav/p316_178.wav|||She hopes to study in Britain one day.|
033544|316-en|en|wav/p316_179.wav|||Everything in the world was focused on London.|
033545|316-en|en|wav/p316_180.wav|||We played better after the break.|
033546|316-en|en|wav/p316_181.wav|||But this relative success has not been easy.|
033547|316-en|en|wav/p316_182.wav|||It was the same with the Dickens.|
033548|316-en|en|wav/p316_183.wav|||Of course it is still possible.|
033549|316-en|en|wav/p316_184.wav|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|
033550|316-en|en|wav/p316_185.wav|||That, in a way, is the point.|
033551|316-en|en|wav/p316_186.wav|||What is so unusual about this case?|
033552|316-en|en|wav/p316_187.wav|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
033553|316-en|en|wav/p316_188.wav|||That would end it for us.|
033554|316-en|en|wav/p316_189.wav|||Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.|
033555|316-en|en|wav/p316_190.wav|||Sure, he is the best player in the world.|
033556|316-en|en|wav/p316_191.wav|||I just love lessons.|
033557|316-en|en|wav/p316_192.wav|||Retirement is on his mind.|
033558|316-en|en|wav/p316_193.wav|||It's to do with this place.|
033559|316-en|en|wav/p316_194.wav|||The home side didn't stand a chance.|
033560|316-en|en|wav/p316_195.wav|||We shall not be moved.|
033561|316-en|en|wav/p316_196.wav|||The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|
033562|316-en|en|wav/p316_197.wav|||It is not just the agencies.|
033563|316-en|en|wav/p316_198.wav|||There must be boundaries.|
033564|316-en|en|wav/p316_199.wav|||However, he was later released without charge.|
033565|316-en|en|wav/p316_200.wav|||Arsenal refused to be evicted.|
033566|316-en|en|wav/p316_201.wav|||I watch the other visitors.|
033567|316-en|en|wav/p316_202.wav|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
033568|316-en|en|wav/p316_204.wav|||He confirmed his fitness.|
033569|316-en|en|wav/p316_205.wav|||The gap is narrowing.|
033570|316-en|en|wav/p316_206.wav|||All of us in Scotland should be viligant.|
033571|316-en|en|wav/p316_207.wav|||Both men were uninjured.|
033572|316-en|en|wav/p316_208.wav|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
033573|316-en|en|wav/p316_209.wav|||It is not a financial issue.|
033574|316-en|en|wav/p316_210.wav|||We are in this for the long haul.|
033575|316-en|en|wav/p316_211.wav|||We have a budget in March.|
033576|316-en|en|wav/p316_212.wav|||There was no respite.|
033577|316-en|en|wav/p316_213.wav|||I got very, very tired.|
033578|316-en|en|wav/p316_214.wav|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
033579|316-en|en|wav/p316_215.wav|||They will do their own thing.|
033580|316-en|en|wav/p316_216.wav|||It is too much for me.|
033581|316-en|en|wav/p316_217.wav|||But is this enough to provoke a killing?|
033582|316-en|en|wav/p316_218.wav|||I didn't just walk in and get it.|
033583|316-en|en|wav/p316_219.wav|||We've made a couple of albums.|
033584|316-en|en|wav/p316_220.wav|||We need a much wider debate.|
033585|316-en|en|wav/p316_221.wav|||My attitude is exactly the same as before.|
033586|316-en|en|wav/p316_222.wav|||Look at a computer.|
033587|316-en|en|wav/p316_223.wav|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
033588|316-en|en|wav/p316_224.wav|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
033589|316-en|en|wav/p316_225.wav|||So what could be better than becoming a captain?|
033590|316-en|en|wav/p316_226.wav|||However, it proved to be the turning point.|
033591|316-en|en|wav/p316_227.wav|||However, everyone should do it once in their life.|
033592|316-en|en|wav/p316_228.wav|||In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.|
033593|316-en|en|wav/p316_229.wav|||I waited and waited.|
033594|316-en|en|wav/p316_230.wav|||We all knew it could not be true.|
033595|316-en|en|wav/p316_231.wav|||Its future is uncertain.|
033596|316-en|en|wav/p316_232.wav|||I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.|
033597|316-en|en|wav/p316_233.wav|||It doesn't look good for her.|
033598|316-en|en|wav/p316_234.wav|||She said he did not look too happy.|
033599|316-en|en|wav/p316_235.wav|||We are aware of the problem.|
033600|316-en|en|wav/p316_236.wav|||Where will the elderly go then?|
033601|316-en|en|wav/p316_237.wav|||Then it was changed without notice.|
033602|316-en|en|wav/p316_238.wav|||He had a great game.|
033603|316-en|en|wav/p316_239.wav|||The following year, they asked him again.|
033604|316-en|en|wav/p316_240.wav|||It is the men who create the demand.|
033605|316-en|en|wav/p316_241.wav|||I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.|
033606|316-en|en|wav/p316_242.wav|||Every case is completely different.|
033607|316-en|en|wav/p316_243.wav|||It's a scandal, a disgrace.|
033608|316-en|en|wav/p316_244.wav|||Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.|
033609|316-en|en|wav/p316_245.wav|||However, he said the money had not been wasted.|
033610|316-en|en|wav/p316_246.wav|||It will be fine.|
033611|316-en|en|wav/p316_247.wav|||He should emerge as the winner.|
033612|316-en|en|wav/p316_248.wav|||They are you, the fans.|
033613|316-en|en|wav/p316_249.wav|||We're just waiting for her reaction.|
033614|316-en|en|wav/p316_250.wav|||At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|
033615|316-en|en|wav/p316_251.wav|||What a difference a game can make.|
033616|316-en|en|wav/p316_252.wav|||They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.|
033617|316-en|en|wav/p316_253.wav|||Why do it?|
033618|316-en|en|wav/p316_254.wav|||It opened last month.|
033619|316-en|en|wav/p316_255.wav|||This will be our new beginning.|
033620|316-en|en|wav/p316_256.wav|||If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|
033621|316-en|en|wav/p316_257.wav|||I have totally had enough.|
033622|316-en|en|wav/p316_258.wav|||Hopefully today will be the turning point.|
033623|316-en|en|wav/p316_259.wav|||We shall be ready for Rangers.|
033624|316-en|en|wav/p316_260.wav|||It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|
033625|316-en|en|wav/p316_261.wav|||There were no reported casualties on the ground.|
033626|316-en|en|wav/p316_262.wav|||What are you waiting for?|
033627|316-en|en|wav/p316_263.wav|||In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.|
033628|316-en|en|wav/p316_264.wav|||This is still happening in the US.|
033629|316-en|en|wav/p316_265.wav|||Another issue will be policing.|
033630|316-en|en|wav/p316_266.wav|||Today was first class.|
033631|316-en|en|wav/p316_267.wav|||This is the biggest surprise of my life.|
033632|316-en|en|wav/p316_268.wav|||On the contrary, it was actually very funny.|
033633|316-en|en|wav/p316_269.wav|||This is a good move for me.|
033634|316-en|en|wav/p316_270.wav|||Feel the heat?|
033635|316-en|en|wav/p316_271.wav|||She was so full of life.|
033636|316-en|en|wav/p316_272.wav|||I should have given him one in return.|
033637|316-en|en|wav/p316_273.wav|||I began to pray.|
033638|316-en|en|wav/p316_274.wav|||The princess has strong links with Scotland.|
033639|316-en|en|wav/p316_275.wav|||I am very confident about tomorrow night.|
033640|316-en|en|wav/p316_276.wav|||I just wanted to fly.|
033641|316-en|en|wav/p316_277.wav|||And he has a tale to tell.|
033642|316-en|en|wav/p316_278.wav|||Footballers have also been targeted.|
033643|316-en|en|wav/p316_279.wav|||The deadline is real and absolute.|
033644|316-en|en|wav/p316_280.wav|||So, how did this happen?|
033645|316-en|en|wav/p316_281.wav|||It's all a part of letting it go.|
033646|316-en|en|wav/p316_282.wav|||I just hope it's not tonight against us.|
033647|316-en|en|wav/p316_283.wav|||There are no quick fixes.|
033648|316-en|en|wav/p316_284.wav|||The change was not instant.|
033649|316-en|en|wav/p316_285.wav|||We've got the bronze.|
033650|316-en|en|wav/p316_286.wav|||They use them for everything.|
033651|316-en|en|wav/p316_287.wav|||Who is to benefit from this change?|
033652|316-en|en|wav/p316_288.wav|||We are not defeated.|
033653|316-en|en|wav/p316_289.wav|||He knows what he's got to do.|
033654|316-en|en|wav/p316_290.wav|||Clearly, the stakes are high.|
033655|316-en|en|wav/p316_291.wav|||We have been going for three years.|
033656|316-en|en|wav/p316_292.wav|||We deserved the three points.|
033657|316-en|en|wav/p316_293.wav|||It is planned for London in the spring.|
033658|316-en|en|wav/p316_294.wav|||War and force are not the only solutions.|
033659|316-en|en|wav/p316_295.wav|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
033660|316-en|en|wav/p316_296.wav|||It didn't matter who was in their way.|
033661|316-en|en|wav/p316_297.wav|||Which brings us to the point.|
033662|316-en|en|wav/p316_298.wav|||I think it's difficult for Bonnie.|
033663|316-en|en|wav/p316_299.wav|||I am quite excited about it.|
033664|316-en|en|wav/p316_300.wav|||Everyone agrees with that.|
033665|316-en|en|wav/p316_301.wav|||She had denied the charge.|
033666|316-en|en|wav/p316_302.wav|||If we live forever, can we really be said to live?|
033667|316-en|en|wav/p316_303.wav|||Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.|
033668|316-en|en|wav/p316_304.wav|||I didn't feel good.|
033669|316-en|en|wav/p316_305.wav|||It is believed that he had been stabbed.|
033670|316-en|en|wav/p316_306.wav|||It is an expensive part of their equipment.|
033671|316-en|en|wav/p316_307.wav|||Let's get to know him.|
033672|316-en|en|wav/p316_308.wav|||We have got to attack.|
033673|316-en|en|wav/p316_309.wav|||Well, they were the unlucky ones.|
033674|316-en|en|wav/p316_310.wav|||Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.|
033675|316-en|en|wav/p316_311.wav|||It divided audiences at Cannes.|
033676|316-en|en|wav/p316_312.wav|||It's a lovely, lovely film.|
033677|316-en|en|wav/p316_313.wav|||How would it work?|
033678|316-en|en|wav/p316_314.wav|||We told them in July.|
033679|316-en|en|wav/p316_315.wav|||The film was great.|
033680|316-en|en|wav/p316_316.wav|||Venus rejects the very suggestion.|
033681|316-en|en|wav/p316_317.wav|||It's a real challenge.|
033682|316-en|en|wav/p316_318.wav|||The police believe that the man was not injured.|
033683|316-en|en|wav/p316_319.wav|||Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|
033684|316-en|en|wav/p316_320.wav|||There was too much at stake.|
033685|316-en|en|wav/p316_321.wav|||I read about it in the newspapers.|
033686|316-en|en|wav/p316_322.wav|||What did they think of her voice?|
033687|316-en|en|wav/p316_323.wav|||Is that not uncanny?|
033688|316-en|en|wav/p316_324.wav|||It has to reinvent itself.|
033689|316-en|en|wav/p316_325.wav|||It is a good result for Great Britain.|
033690|316-en|en|wav/p316_326.wav|||He was happy with his form.|
033691|316-en|en|wav/p316_327.wav|||His art was not just about emotions.|
033692|316-en|en|wav/p316_328.wav|||Nato was not a love affair.|
033693|316-en|en|wav/p316_329.wav|||It's a production company.|
033694|316-en|en|wav/p316_330.wav|||But we will not be scared.|
033695|316-en|en|wav/p316_331.wav|||But that is not an issue for now.|
033696|316-en|en|wav/p316_332.wav|||It will not work in our favour.|
033697|316-en|en|wav/p316_333.wav|||It is the wealthiest in Europe.|
033698|316-en|en|wav/p316_334.wav|||He is on the wrong side.|
033699|316-en|en|wav/p316_335.wav|||That was a disgraceful performance.|
033700|316-en|en|wav/p316_336.wav|||There will be no receivers.|
033701|316-en|en|wav/p316_337.wav|||My son was too young to die.|
033702|316-en|en|wav/p316_338.wav|||The air campaign is not over yet.|
033703|316-en|en|wav/p316_339.wav|||It's a national sport.|
033704|316-en|en|wav/p316_340.wav|||But this isn't a play about The Troubles.|
033705|316-en|en|wav/p316_341.wav|||The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.|
033706|316-en|en|wav/p316_342.wav|||Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.|
033707|316-en|en|wav/p316_343.wav|||I was shocked and outraged.|
033708|316-en|en|wav/p316_344.wav|||Not many people like to do that.|
033709|316-en|en|wav/p316_345.wav|||It was extremely cold.|
033710|316-en|en|wav/p316_346.wav|||Italy would be lukewarm.|
033711|316-en|en|wav/p316_347.wav|||People are using it in their daily lives.|
033712|316-en|en|wav/p316_348.wav|||Chelsea was a great club.|
033713|316-en|en|wav/p316_349.wav|||We have to open up.|
033714|316-en|en|wav/p316_350.wav|||She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|
033715|316-en|en|wav/p316_351.wav|||There is a review outgoing at the moment.|
033716|316-en|en|wav/p316_352.wav|||The pensioners did not want to know.|

033731|316-en|en|wav/p316_367.wav|||It is based on his movement records.|
033732|316-en|en|wav/p316_368.wav|||It wasn't an easy decision.|
033733|316-en|en|wav/p316_369.wav|||It left me with sadness.|
033734|316-en|en|wav/p316_370.wav|||There is a changing of the guard.|
033735|316-en|en|wav/p316_371.wav|||The boys are very confident.|
033736|316-en|en|wav/p316_372.wav|||It was our time maybe.|
033737|316-en|en|wav/p316_373.wav|||I know we can play a lot better.|
033738|316-en|en|wav/p316_374.wav|||We said it will happen one night.|
033739|316-en|en|wav/p316_375.wav|||It is a flexible concept.|
033740|316-en|en|wav/p316_376.wav|||This election is far from over.|
033741|316-en|en|wav/p316_377.wav|||So the Government will be damaged.|

033760|316-en|en|wav/p316_396.wav|||They are taking a stand against this.|
033761|316-en|en|wav/p316_397.wav|||They are not left wing.|
033762|316-en|en|wav/p316_398.wav|||I was the sheep.|
033763|316-en|en|wav/p316_399.wav|||I think we believed the tie was won.|

033766|316-en|en|wav/p316_402.wav|||It was a great team effort.|
033767|316-en|en|wav/p316_403.wav|||In my experience, he does not do that.|
033768|316-en|en|wav/p316_404.wav|||Mr Forrester reacted angrily.|

033773|316-en|en|wav/p316_409.wav|||Taxation should be simplified.|
033774|316-en|en|wav/p316_410.wav|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|

033776|316-en|en|wav/p316_412.wav|||I have signed a contract.|
033777|316-en|en|wav/p316_413.wav|||I have never been overly ambitious.|

033779|316-en|en|wav/p316_415.wav|||I hope you don't regret it.|
033780|316-en|en|wav/p316_416.wav|||He was all blackened.|
033781|316-en|en|wav/p316_417.wav|||This is your country.|

033784|316-en|en|wav/p316_420.wav|||They responded in the most positive way.|
033785|316-en|en|wav/p316_421.wav|||The British government said she was coming home.|
033786|316-en|en|wav/p316_422.wav|||We won very easily.|

033788|317-en|en|wav/p317_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
033789|317-en|en|wav/p317_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
033790|317-en|en|wav/p317_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
033791|317-en|en|wav/p317_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
033792|317-en|en|wav/p317_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
033793|317-en|en|wav/p317_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
033794|317-en|en|wav/p317_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033795|317-en|en|wav/p317_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033796|317-en|en|wav/p317_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
033797|317-en|en|wav/p317_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
033798|317-en|en|wav/p317_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033799|317-en|en|wav/p317_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033800|317-en|en|wav/p317_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
033801|317-en|en|wav/p317_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
033802|317-en|en|wav/p317_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
033803|317-en|en|wav/p317_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
033804|317-en|en|wav/p317_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033805|317-en|en|wav/p317_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033806|317-en|en|wav/p317_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033807|317-en|en|wav/p317_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033808|317-en|en|wav/p317_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
033809|317-en|en|wav/p317_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033810|317-en|en|wav/p317_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
033811|317-en|en|wav/p317_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
033812|317-en|en|wav/p317_025.wav|||They have the cash to do that.|
033813|317-en|en|wav/p317_026.wav|||There was a fine line to tread.|
033814|317-en|en|wav/p317_027.wav|||Yet it is all for two good causes.|
033815|317-en|en|wav/p317_028.wav|||It is so elusive and light.|
033816|317-en|en|wav/p317_029.wav|||I am not a fan of stoppages.|

033818|317-en|en|wav/p317_031.wav|||Is the war over?|
033819|317-en|en|wav/p317_032.wav|||The country is in a state of chaos.|
033820|317-en|en|wav/p317_033.wav|||But don't expect an easy ride.|
033821|317-en|en|wav/p317_034.wav|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
033822|317-en|en|wav/p317_035.wav|||Some US embassy staff have left the country.|
033823|317-en|en|wav/p317_036.wav|||It was a policy they were against.|

033825|317-en|en|wav/p317_038.wav|||We see little sign of improvement.|
033826|317-en|en|wav/p317_039.wav|||The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?|
033827|317-en|en|wav/p317_040.wav|||The gaffer was great.|
033828|317-en|en|wav/p317_041.wav|||Overall, however, these were also down.|
033829|317-en|en|wav/p317_042.wav|||Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.|
033830|317-en|en|wav/p317_043.wav|||Had she enjoyed the experience?|
033831|317-en|en|wav/p317_044.wav|||I feel very sad and extremely cut up.|
033832|317-en|en|wav/p317_045.wav|||She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.|
033833|317-en|en|wav/p317_046.wav|||I would think they are just behind them.|
033834|317-en|en|wav/p317_047.wav|||We then went to see the headmaster.|
033835|317-en|en|wav/p317_048.wav|||As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.|
033836|317-en|en|wav/p317_049.wav|||There is no mandate for a regime change.|
033837|317-en|en|wav/p317_050.wav|||He did the right thing by ignoring me.|
033838|317-en|en|wav/p317_051.wav|||These men are a part of India.|
033839|317-en|en|wav/p317_052.wav|||Are we going to stay up?|

033841|317-en|en|wav/p317_054.wav|||I am going home to see my children.|
033842|317-en|en|wav/p317_055.wav|||New potential dangers were emerging.|
033843|317-en|en|wav/p317_056.wav|||That tells you something about them.|
033844|317-en|en|wav/p317_057.wav|||The father was treated like a criminal, and why?|
033845|317-en|en|wav/p317_058.wav|||I am a drug addict.|
033846|317-en|en|wav/p317_059.wav|||I've had to take time off work today.|
033847|317-en|en|wav/p317_060.wav|||The problem is the book.|

033857|317-en|en|wav/p317_070.wav|||And what does it cost, and who is paying?|

033859|317-en|en|wav/p317_072.wav|||This is not an optional extra.|
033860|317-en|en|wav/p317_073.wav|||This is not the most crucial issue.|
033861|317-en|en|wav/p317_074.wav|||We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.|
033862|317-en|en|wav/p317_075.wav|||It's that sort of night.|

033876|317-en|en|wav/p317_089.wav|||This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.|

033878|317-en|en|wav/p317_091.wav|||We could not compete with Rangers.|
033879|317-en|en|wav/p317_092.wav|||In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|
033880|317-en|en|wav/p317_093.wav|||But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.|
033881|317-en|en|wav/p317_094.wav|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
033882|317-en|en|wav/p317_095.wav|||However, it is much bigger than that.|
033883|317-en|en|wav/p317_096.wav|||One season, they might do well.|
033884|317-en|en|wav/p317_097.wav|||Our approach will be different.|
033885|317-en|en|wav/p317_098.wav|||Too much has already been said.|

033899|317-en|en|wav/p317_112.wav|||That just wasn't good enough.|
033900|317-en|en|wav/p317_113.wav|||The company has other problems with the shells.|

033904|317-en|en|wav/p317_117.wav|||We must get the three points.|
033905|317-en|en|wav/p317_118.wav|||Players were held in equally low regard.|

033907|317-en|en|wav/p317_120.wav|||It's to do with context.|

033915|317-en|en|wav/p317_128.wav|||I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.|
033916|317-en|en|wav/p317_129.wav|||You would be wrong.|

034041|317-en|en|wav/p317_254.wav|||He must have sat down, relieved it was over.|
034042|317-en|en|wav/p317_255.wav|||He will do so today in Monte Carlo.|
034043|317-en|en|wav/p317_256.wav|||The man was pronounced dead on arrival.|
034044|317-en|en|wav/p317_257.wav|||Health care workers and labourers followed.|

034053|317-en|en|wav/p317_266.wav|||There were no proposals on the table.|
034054|317-en|en|wav/p317_267.wav|||I have spoken to head office.|

034060|317-en|en|wav/p317_273.wav|||We are committed to urgent action.|
034061|317-en|en|wav/p317_274.wav|||Hopefully, now we're getting it.|
034062|317-en|en|wav/p317_275.wav|||I am totally surprised.|
034063|317-en|en|wav/p317_276.wav|||Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.|
034064|317-en|en|wav/p317_277.wav|||But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.|
034065|317-en|en|wav/p317_278.wav|||The bookies have got it about right.|
034066|317-en|en|wav/p317_279.wav|||There's not much money in cycling.|

034068|317-en|en|wav/p317_281.wav|||I think we're very different.|
034069|317-en|en|wav/p317_282.wav|||For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.|
034070|317-en|en|wav/p317_283.wav|||The way forward is working with other disciplines.|
034071|317-en|en|wav/p317_284.wav|||And that is not a bad idea.|
034072|317-en|en|wav/p317_285.wav|||He also has a house in Italy.|
034073|317-en|en|wav/p317_286.wav|||Blood samples were taken.|
034074|317-en|en|wav/p317_287.wav|||In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.|
034075|317-en|en|wav/p317_288.wav|||Scotland need to work on two key areas.|
034076|317-en|en|wav/p317_289.wav|||It's so creative and different.|
034077|317-en|en|wav/p317_290.wav|||They are in care for a reason.|
034078|317-en|en|wav/p317_291.wav|||They refused to fire on their own countrymen.|
034079|317-en|en|wav/p317_292.wav|||In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.|
034080|317-en|en|wav/p317_293.wav|||Obviously, Airbus is one of these.|
034081|317-en|en|wav/p317_294.wav|||It got no better.|
034082|317-en|en|wav/p317_295.wav|||I keep my fingers crossed.|
034083|317-en|en|wav/p317_296.wav|||Some were close to tears.|
034084|317-en|en|wav/p317_297.wav|||It would then be up to the judge.|
034085|317-en|en|wav/p317_298.wav|||Was all this really just five months ago?|
034086|317-en|en|wav/p317_299.wav|||Some reports said they had been killed.|
034087|317-en|en|wav/p317_300.wav|||This is the start of a new campaign.|
034088|317-en|en|wav/p317_301.wav|||It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.|
034089|317-en|en|wav/p317_302.wav|||The failings are serious.|
034090|317-en|en|wav/p317_303.wav|||It is like a bereavement.|
034091|317-en|en|wav/p317_304.wav|||I shouldn't have to put up with it.|
034092|317-en|en|wav/p317_305.wav|||It could have been just a quick fix.|
034093|317-en|en|wav/p317_306.wav|||I got on very well with Allan.|
034094|317-en|en|wav/p317_307.wav|||That has given me great confidence.|
034095|317-en|en|wav/p317_308.wav|||This is a dream come true for me.|

034099|317-en|en|wav/p317_312.wav|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
034100|317-en|en|wav/p317_313.wav|||Ferguson did not hesitate.|
034101|317-en|en|wav/p317_314.wav|||Managers and clinicians must work together.|
034102|317-en|en|wav/p317_315.wav|||They didn't have a care in the world.|
034103|317-en|en|wav/p317_316.wav|||I was in the zone in the morning.|
034104|317-en|en|wav/p317_317.wav|||He urged people to forgive.|
034105|317-en|en|wav/p317_318.wav|||In fact, it might just be beginning.|
034106|317-en|en|wav/p317_319.wav|||So he is open to ideas.|
034107|317-en|en|wav/p317_320.wav|||Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.|
034108|317-en|en|wav/p317_321.wav|||Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.|
034109|317-en|en|wav/p317_322.wav|||There is no right to appeal.|
034110|317-en|en|wav/p317_323.wav|||We are expected to do better than before.|
034111|317-en|en|wav/p317_324.wav|||The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.|
034112|317-en|en|wav/p317_325.wav|||I am not even thinking about that.|
034113|317-en|en|wav/p317_326.wav|||Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.|
034114|317-en|en|wav/p317_327.wav|||The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.|
034115|317-en|en|wav/p317_328.wav|||It is good for their eyesight.|
034116|317-en|en|wav/p317_329.wav|||I feel it is very irrational.|
034117|317-en|en|wav/p317_330.wav|||It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.|
034118|317-en|en|wav/p317_331.wav|||It is still with Ministers.|
034119|317-en|en|wav/p317_332.wav|||The effect was almost magical.|
034120|317-en|en|wav/p317_333.wav|||Everything is obviously in the very early stages.|
034121|317-en|en|wav/p317_334.wav|||We are not doing the Today programme.|

034123|317-en|en|wav/p317_336.wav|||She was charged with perjury.|
034124|317-en|en|wav/p317_337.wav|||I was not a joiner.|
034125|317-en|en|wav/p317_338.wav|||The sleeper was six hours late.|
034126|317-en|en|wav/p317_339.wav|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
034127|317-en|en|wav/p317_340.wav|||Stewart will travel with some confidence.|
034128|317-en|en|wav/p317_341.wav|||Sunday's game was not a trial.|
034129|317-en|en|wav/p317_342.wav|||They were average apart, together superb.|
034130|317-en|en|wav/p317_343.wav|||Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.|
034131|317-en|en|wav/p317_344.wav|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
034132|317-en|en|wav/p317_345.wav|||That never seemed likely.|
034133|317-en|en|wav/p317_346.wav|||A decision is expected next March.|
034134|317-en|en|wav/p317_347.wav|||We don't believe anything anymore.|
034135|317-en|en|wav/p317_348.wav|||I am awaiting a reply.|
034136|317-en|en|wav/p317_349.wav|||There was no need for such a hostel.|
034137|317-en|en|wav/p317_350.wav|||This comes down to a problem of arrogance.|
034138|317-en|en|wav/p317_351.wav|||Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.|
034139|317-en|en|wav/p317_352.wav|||There's no doubt about it.|
034140|317-en|en|wav/p317_353.wav|||It just came into my head that day.|
034141|317-en|en|wav/p317_354.wav|||We've always had a very positive attitude.|
034142|317-en|en|wav/p317_355.wav|||What's a boy to do?|
034143|317-en|en|wav/p317_356.wav|||We're not an employment agency.|
034144|317-en|en|wav/p317_357.wav|||The other was the tabloids.|
034145|317-en|en|wav/p317_358.wav|||They should be swept away.|
034146|317-en|en|wav/p317_359.wav|||They thought the set-up there was unfair.|
034147|317-en|en|wav/p317_360.wav|||I am saddened to hear of the accident.|
034148|317-en|en|wav/p317_361.wav|||We want to replicate that success.|
034149|317-en|en|wav/p317_362.wav|||We were lucky to have survived.|
034150|317-en|en|wav/p317_363.wav|||Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|
034151|317-en|en|wav/p317_364.wav|||I am very happy to be here.|
034152|317-en|en|wav/p317_365.wav|||He would help me with the form.|
034153|317-en|en|wav/p317_366.wav|||We could easily be cut again.|
034154|317-en|en|wav/p317_367.wav|||That meant the search was unlawful.|
034155|317-en|en|wav/p317_368.wav|||And he goes with it.|
034156|317-en|en|wav/p317_369.wav|||The actors just have to say so.|
034157|317-en|en|wav/p317_370.wav|||Someone else can do the cooking that night.|
034158|317-en|en|wav/p317_371.wav|||I am so lucky for that.|
034159|317-en|en|wav/p317_372.wav|||It broke up my marriage.|
034160|317-en|en|wav/p317_373.wav|||He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.|
034161|317-en|en|wav/p317_374.wav|||The minister is the engineer.|
034162|317-en|en|wav/p317_375.wav|||After that, it's a step into the unknown.|
034163|317-en|en|wav/p317_376.wav|||I think it was briefly considered.|
034164|317-en|en|wav/p317_377.wav|||And Rangers think they have problems.|
034165|317-en|en|wav/p317_378.wav|||We talk to each other about these matters.|
034166|317-en|en|wav/p317_379.wav|||It's a hidden problem.|
034167|317-en|en|wav/p317_380.wav|||They serve a multitude of purposes.|
034168|317-en|en|wav/p317_381.wav|||There will be two other areas of contention.|
034169|317-en|en|wav/p317_382.wav|||I lost a part of me.|
034170|317-en|en|wav/p317_383.wav|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
034171|317-en|en|wav/p317_384.wav|||Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|
034172|317-en|en|wav/p317_385.wav|||But he has strong links to Labour.|
034173|317-en|en|wav/p317_386.wav|||Bob Dylan is getting old.|
034174|317-en|en|wav/p317_387.wav|||I never thought it would take this long.|
034175|317-en|en|wav/p317_388.wav|||And he is immensely loyal.|
034176|317-en|en|wav/p317_389.wav|||It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|
034177|317-en|en|wav/p317_390.wav|||They think that it matters but it doesn't.|
034178|317-en|en|wav/p317_391.wav|||This looks like it is anything but open.|
034179|317-en|en|wav/p317_392.wav|||My only ambition is to enjoy my work.|
034180|317-en|en|wav/p317_393.wav|||She kept him on a string.|
034181|317-en|en|wav/p317_394.wav|||The committees are due to report next year.|
034182|317-en|en|wav/p317_395.wav|||It's a long-term solution.|
034183|317-en|en|wav/p317_396.wav|||That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.|
034184|317-en|en|wav/p317_397.wav|||What's the theme?|
034185|317-en|en|wav/p317_398.wav|||He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|
034186|317-en|en|wav/p317_399.wav|||It shows that painting is still relevant.|
034187|317-en|en|wav/p317_400.wav|||It's a very special unit.|
034188|317-en|en|wav/p317_401.wav|||The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|
034189|317-en|en|wav/p317_402.wav|||Davis is very supportive, as a director.|
034190|317-en|en|wav/p317_403.wav|||However, the groups denied the claims.|
034191|317-en|en|wav/p317_404.wav|||It's only tackling congestion.|
034192|317-en|en|wav/p317_405.wav|||And our game is about going forward.|
034193|317-en|en|wav/p317_406.wav|||They will have to cut through the roof.|
034194|317-en|en|wav/p317_407.wav|||Then there's one where people play for fun.|
034195|317-en|en|wav/p317_408.wav|||That's the law of the land.|
034196|317-en|en|wav/p317_409.wav|||They have enough intrusion at the time.|
034197|317-en|en|wav/p317_410.wav|||What's wrong with that?|
034198|317-en|en|wav/p317_411.wav|||This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.|
034199|317-en|en|wav/p317_412.wav|||Then one night only three people turn up.|
034200|317-en|en|wav/p317_413.wav|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
034201|317-en|en|wav/p317_414.wav|||Now we see the impact of global politics.|
034202|317-en|en|wav/p317_415.wav|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
034203|317-en|en|wav/p317_416.wav|||This was not the show for me.|
034204|317-en|en|wav/p317_417.wav|||The police have to act to help them.|
034205|317-en|en|wav/p317_418.wav|||She was extremely rigid.|
034206|317-en|en|wav/p317_419.wav|||Neither side can win this war.|
034207|317-en|en|wav/p317_420.wav|||Borrowing power was one of those improvements.|
034208|317-en|en|wav/p317_421.wav|||We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.|
034209|317-en|en|wav/p317_422.wav|||Appointments should be made on merit.|
034210|317-en|en|wav/p317_423.wav|||Manchester United are the classic example.|
034211|318-en|en|wav/p318_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
034212|318-en|en|wav/p318_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
034213|318-en|en|wav/p318_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
034214|318-en|en|wav/p318_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034215|318-en|en|wav/p318_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034216|318-en|en|wav/p318_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034217|318-en|en|wav/p318_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034218|318-en|en|wav/p318_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034219|318-en|en|wav/p318_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034220|318-en|en|wav/p318_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034221|318-en|en|wav/p318_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034222|318-en|en|wav/p318_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034223|318-en|en|wav/p318_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034224|318-en|en|wav/p318_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
034225|318-en|en|wav/p318_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034226|318-en|en|wav/p318_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034227|318-en|en|wav/p318_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034228|318-en|en|wav/p318_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034229|318-en|en|wav/p318_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034230|318-en|en|wav/p318_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034232|318-en|en|wav/p318_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034233|318-en|en|wav/p318_025.wav|||They will be dealt with.|
034234|318-en|en|wav/p318_026.wav|||It is never an easy game.|
034235|318-en|en|wav/p318_027.wav|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
034236|318-en|en|wav/p318_028.wav|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
034237|318-en|en|wav/p318_029.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
034238|318-en|en|wav/p318_030.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
034239|318-en|en|wav/p318_031.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
034240|318-en|en|wav/p318_032.wav|||It was important to win the singles.|
034241|318-en|en|wav/p318_033.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
034242|318-en|en|wav/p318_034.wav|||That is impressive by any standards.|
034243|318-en|en|wav/p318_035.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
034244|318-en|en|wav/p318_036.wav|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
034245|318-en|en|wav/p318_037.wav|||This was the performance, and the result they needed.|
034246|318-en|en|wav/p318_038.wav|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
034247|318-en|en|wav/p318_039.wav|||It helped to get me noticed.|
034248|318-en|en|wav/p318_040.wav|||They hit me in the head.|
034249|318-en|en|wav/p318_041.wav|||But he is not using them.|
034250|318-en|en|wav/p318_042.wav|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
034251|318-en|en|wav/p318_043.wav|||We are not moving in.|
034252|318-en|en|wav/p318_044.wav|||We have not had a formal request.|
034253|318-en|en|wav/p318_045.wav|||I never had a childhood.|
034254|318-en|en|wav/p318_046.wav|||Its effect on humans is not yet known.|
034255|318-en|en|wav/p318_047.wav|||We offered something different.|
034256|318-en|en|wav/p318_048.wav|||We were very much a happy family.|
034257|318-en|en|wav/p318_049.wav|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
034258|318-en|en|wav/p318_050.wav|||My brother is buried under there.|
034259|318-en|en|wav/p318_051.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
034260|318-en|en|wav/p318_052.wav|||What were they?|
034261|318-en|en|wav/p318_053.wav|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
034262|318-en|en|wav/p318_054.wav|||He will be judged by his actions.|
034263|318-en|en|wav/p318_055.wav|||Her role in it was small.|
034264|318-en|en|wav/p318_056.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
034265|318-en|en|wav/p318_057.wav|||We might be back next year.|
034266|318-en|en|wav/p318_058.wav|||In a way he was.|
034267|318-en|en|wav/p318_059.wav|||It's back to how it used to be.|
034268|318-en|en|wav/p318_060.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
034269|318-en|en|wav/p318_061.wav|||The firm was down and almost out.|
034270|318-en|en|wav/p318_062.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
034271|318-en|en|wav/p318_063.wav|||I was chosen to do this.|
034272|318-en|en|wav/p318_064.wav|||I learned a lot from that.|
034273|318-en|en|wav/p318_065.wav|||The house was so well alight.|
034274|318-en|en|wav/p318_066.wav|||He got his degree.|
034275|318-en|en|wav/p318_067.wav|||Sandy was very active.|
034276|318-en|en|wav/p318_068.wav|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
034277|318-en|en|wav/p318_069.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
034278|318-en|en|wav/p318_070.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
034279|318-en|en|wav/p318_071.wav|||There were no formal announcements.|
034280|318-en|en|wav/p318_072.wav|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
034281|318-en|en|wav/p318_073.wav|||It really has left the town in shock.|
034282|318-en|en|wav/p318_074.wav|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
034283|318-en|en|wav/p318_075.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
034284|318-en|en|wav/p318_076.wav|||This was much worse.|
034285|318-en|en|wav/p318_077.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
034286|318-en|en|wav/p318_078.wav|||We are confident of taking that back.|
034287|318-en|en|wav/p318_079.wav|||They must be kept on the ground.|
034288|318-en|en|wav/p318_080.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
034289|318-en|en|wav/p318_081.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
034290|318-en|en|wav/p318_082.wav|||This does not help.|
034291|318-en|en|wav/p318_083.wav|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
034292|318-en|en|wav/p318_084.wav|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
034293|318-en|en|wav/p318_085.wav|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
034294|318-en|en|wav/p318_086.wav|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
034295|318-en|en|wav/p318_087.wav|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
034296|318-en|en|wav/p318_088.wav|||This could be her way forward.|
034297|318-en|en|wav/p318_089.wav|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
034298|318-en|en|wav/p318_090.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
034299|318-en|en|wav/p318_091.wav|||It's a very, very special day.|
034300|318-en|en|wav/p318_092.wav|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
034301|318-en|en|wav/p318_093.wav|||There's also the point.|
034302|318-en|en|wav/p318_094.wav|||It was forced to divert.|
034303|318-en|en|wav/p318_095.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
034304|318-en|en|wav/p318_096.wav|||That's the National Grid.|
034305|318-en|en|wav/p318_097.wav|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
034306|318-en|en|wav/p318_098.wav|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|
034307|318-en|en|wav/p318_099.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
034308|318-en|en|wav/p318_100.wav|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
034309|318-en|en|wav/p318_101.wav|||This is my personal assessment.|
034310|318-en|en|wav/p318_102.wav|||There was no trouble at all.|
034311|318-en|en|wav/p318_103.wav|||Although, you never know.|
034312|318-en|en|wav/p318_104.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
034313|318-en|en|wav/p318_105.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
034314|318-en|en|wav/p318_106.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
034315|318-en|en|wav/p318_107.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
034316|318-en|en|wav/p318_108.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
034317|318-en|en|wav/p318_109.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
034318|318-en|en|wav/p318_110.wav|||I took the gun.|
034319|318-en|en|wav/p318_111.wav|||It's just one of those things.|
034320|318-en|en|wav/p318_112.wav|||A web site is planned for November.|
034321|318-en|en|wav/p318_113.wav|||We played so well at times.|
034322|318-en|en|wav/p318_114.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
034323|318-en|en|wav/p318_115.wav|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
034324|318-en|en|wav/p318_116.wav|||We act because we must.|
034325|318-en|en|wav/p318_117.wav|||They will be destroyed.|
034326|318-en|en|wav/p318_118.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
034327|318-en|en|wav/p318_119.wav|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
034328|318-en|en|wav/p318_120.wav|||The Tory party will last.|
034329|318-en|en|wav/p318_121.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
034330|318-en|en|wav/p318_122.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
034331|318-en|en|wav/p318_123.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
034332|318-en|en|wav/p318_124.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
034333|318-en|en|wav/p318_125.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
034334|318-en|en|wav/p318_126.wav|||What's the point?|
034335|318-en|en|wav/p318_127.wav|||Why is this?|
034336|318-en|en|wav/p318_128.wav|||What has changed since then?|
034337|318-en|en|wav/p318_129.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
034338|318-en|en|wav/p318_130.wav|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
034339|318-en|en|wav/p318_131.wav|||I'd love to be at the World Cup.|
034340|318-en|en|wav/p318_132.wav|||He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|
034341|318-en|en|wav/p318_133.wav|||I am sorry to hear this news.|
034342|318-en|en|wav/p318_134.wav|||At some point, the bill will be presented.|
034343|318-en|en|wav/p318_135.wav|||I mean it happens.|
034344|318-en|en|wav/p318_136.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
034345|318-en|en|wav/p318_137.wav|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
034346|318-en|en|wav/p318_138.wav|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
034347|318-en|en|wav/p318_139.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
034348|318-en|en|wav/p318_140.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
034349|318-en|en|wav/p318_141.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
034350|318-en|en|wav/p318_142.wav|||It is typical of me.|
034351|318-en|en|wav/p318_143.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
034352|318-en|en|wav/p318_144.wav|||They played it like a cup final.|
034353|318-en|en|wav/p318_145.wav|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
034354|318-en|en|wav/p318_146.wav|||But the championship is not over yet.|
034355|318-en|en|wav/p318_147.wav|||We haven't found out anything different.|
034356|318-en|en|wav/p318_148.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
034357|318-en|en|wav/p318_149.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
034358|318-en|en|wav/p318_150.wav|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
034359|318-en|en|wav/p318_151.wav|||Surely it can do better than that?|
034360|318-en|en|wav/p318_152.wav|||I am ashamed of them.|
034361|318-en|en|wav/p318_153.wav|||Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|
034362|318-en|en|wav/p318_154.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
034363|318-en|en|wav/p318_155.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
034364|318-en|en|wav/p318_156.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
034365|318-en|en|wav/p318_157.wav|||I am not blaming audiences.|
034366|318-en|en|wav/p318_158.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
034367|318-en|en|wav/p318_159.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
034368|318-en|en|wav/p318_160.wav|||He had never run the distance before.|
034369|318-en|en|wav/p318_161.wav|||I can make one further announcement.|
034370|318-en|en|wav/p318_162.wav|||The General Election is all to play for.|
034371|318-en|en|wav/p318_163.wav|||It was a fiery game.|
034372|318-en|en|wav/p318_164.wav|||Agents and coaches must be paid.|
034373|318-en|en|wav/p318_165.wav|||Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|
034374|318-en|en|wav/p318_166.wav|||Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|
034375|318-en|en|wav/p318_167.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
034376|318-en|en|wav/p318_168.wav|||This one is a special case.|
034377|318-en|en|wav/p318_169.wav|||But what are the songs about?|
034378|318-en|en|wav/p318_170.wav|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
034379|318-en|en|wav/p318_171.wav|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
034380|318-en|en|wav/p318_172.wav|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
034381|318-en|en|wav/p318_173.wav|||The stadium was full.|
034382|318-en|en|wav/p318_174.wav|||Dewar is the medium.|
034383|318-en|en|wav/p318_175.wav|||It was that kind of night.|
034384|318-en|en|wav/p318_176.wav|||It is very much a matter for them.|
034385|318-en|en|wav/p318_177.wav|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
034386|318-en|en|wav/p318_178.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
034387|318-en|en|wav/p318_179.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
034388|318-en|en|wav/p318_180.wav|||We won't do that.|
034389|318-en|en|wav/p318_181.wav|||I hope we do.|
034390|318-en|en|wav/p318_182.wav|||From now on there is no hiding place.|
034391|318-en|en|wav/p318_183.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
034392|318-en|en|wav/p318_184.wav|||He quit in October.|
034393|318-en|en|wav/p318_185.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
034394|318-en|en|wav/p318_186.wav|||Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|
034395|318-en|en|wav/p318_187.wav|||Her daughter is getting married.|
034396|318-en|en|wav/p318_188.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
034397|318-en|en|wav/p318_189.wav|||They were that poor.|
034398|318-en|en|wav/p318_190.wav|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
034399|318-en|en|wav/p318_191.wav|||We have understood the problems for some time.|
034400|318-en|en|wav/p318_192.wav|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
034401|318-en|en|wav/p318_193.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
034402|318-en|en|wav/p318_194.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
034403|318-en|en|wav/p318_195.wav|||They believed it worked.|
034404|318-en|en|wav/p318_196.wav|||After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|
034405|318-en|en|wav/p318_197.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
034406|318-en|en|wav/p318_198.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
034407|318-en|en|wav/p318_199.wav|||So they will settle again.|
034408|318-en|en|wav/p318_200.wav|||How do we get more people in?|
034409|318-en|en|wav/p318_201.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
034410|318-en|en|wav/p318_202.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
034411|318-en|en|wav/p318_203.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
034412|318-en|en|wav/p318_204.wav|||Election results are expected soon.|
034413|318-en|en|wav/p318_205.wav|||So she told him.|
034414|318-en|en|wav/p318_206.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
034415|318-en|en|wav/p318_207.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
034416|318-en|en|wav/p318_208.wav|||It was good to score the goal today.|
034417|318-en|en|wav/p318_209.wav|||The night is young.|
034418|318-en|en|wav/p318_210.wav|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
034419|318-en|en|wav/p318_211.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
034420|318-en|en|wav/p318_212.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
034421|318-en|en|wav/p318_213.wav|||The squad will be the same for France.|
034422|318-en|en|wav/p318_214.wav|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
034423|318-en|en|wav/p318_215.wav|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
034424|318-en|en|wav/p318_216.wav|||We are still paying the price for that.|
034425|318-en|en|wav/p318_217.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
034426|318-en|en|wav/p318_218.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
034427|318-en|en|wav/p318_219.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
034428|318-en|en|wav/p318_220.wav|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
034429|318-en|en|wav/p318_221.wav|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
034430|318-en|en|wav/p318_222.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
034431|318-en|en|wav/p318_223.wav|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
034432|318-en|en|wav/p318_224.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
034433|318-en|en|wav/p318_225.wav|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
034434|318-en|en|wav/p318_226.wav|||From our point of view, it is the right time.|
034435|318-en|en|wav/p318_227.wav|||That figure will always remain with me.|
034436|318-en|en|wav/p318_228.wav|||And then a funny thing happened.|
034437|318-en|en|wav/p318_229.wav|||It does not take much.|
034438|318-en|en|wav/p318_230.wav|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
034439|318-en|en|wav/p318_231.wav|||It was a stunning strike.|
034440|318-en|en|wav/p318_232.wav|||It is a technique.|
034441|318-en|en|wav/p318_233.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
034442|318-en|en|wav/p318_234.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
034443|318-en|en|wav/p318_235.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
034444|318-en|en|wav/p318_236.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
034445|318-en|en|wav/p318_237.wav|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
034446|318-en|en|wav/p318_238.wav|||There is nothing to fear.|
034447|318-en|en|wav/p318_239.wav|||I was an athlete.|
034448|318-en|en|wav/p318_240.wav|||Life was like a timetable.|
034449|318-en|en|wav/p318_241.wav|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
034450|318-en|en|wav/p318_242.wav|||I tried to push him away.|
034451|318-en|en|wav/p318_243.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
034452|318-en|en|wav/p318_244.wav|||This was done by the council staff.|
034453|318-en|en|wav/p318_245.wav|||The truth is otherwise.|
034454|318-en|en|wav/p318_246.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
034455|318-en|en|wav/p318_247.wav|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
034456|318-en|en|wav/p318_248.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
034457|318-en|en|wav/p318_249.wav|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
034458|318-en|en|wav/p318_250.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
034459|318-en|en|wav/p318_251.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
034460|318-en|en|wav/p318_252.wav|||The man became a reporter.|
034461|318-en|en|wav/p318_253.wav|||It is a memorial.|
034462|318-en|en|wav/p318_254.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
034463|318-en|en|wav/p318_255.wav|||Our people are paying high prices.|
034464|318-en|en|wav/p318_256.wav|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
034465|318-en|en|wav/p318_257.wav|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
034466|318-en|en|wav/p318_258.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
034467|318-en|en|wav/p318_259.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
034468|318-en|en|wav/p318_260.wav|||I read it every year.|
034469|318-en|en|wav/p318_261.wav|||He was in contention almost every week.|
034470|318-en|en|wav/p318_262.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
034471|318-en|en|wav/p318_263.wav|||It is up to Ann.|
034472|318-en|en|wav/p318_264.wav|||We are playing them at their own game.|
034473|318-en|en|wav/p318_265.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
034474|318-en|en|wav/p318_266.wav|||I had trouble with the producers.|
034475|318-en|en|wav/p318_267.wav|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
034476|318-en|en|wav/p318_268.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
034477|318-en|en|wav/p318_269.wav|||The conference is the first test.|
034478|318-en|en|wav/p318_270.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
034479|318-en|en|wav/p318_271.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|
034480|318-en|en|wav/p318_272.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
034481|318-en|en|wav/p318_273.wav|||There is no more money.|
034482|318-en|en|wav/p318_274.wav|||My mother is a widow.|
034483|318-en|en|wav/p318_275.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
034484|318-en|en|wav/p318_276.wav|||There have been different reports from different people.|
034485|318-en|en|wav/p318_277.wav|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
034486|318-en|en|wav/p318_278.wav|||Something was plainly wrong.|
034487|318-en|en|wav/p318_279.wav|||Why should he go anywhere?|
034488|318-en|en|wav/p318_280.wav|||One thing is sure.|
034489|318-en|en|wav/p318_281.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
034490|318-en|en|wav/p318_282.wav|||I'm confident we can do that.|
034491|318-en|en|wav/p318_283.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
034492|318-en|en|wav/p318_284.wav|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
034493|318-en|en|wav/p318_285.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
034494|318-en|en|wav/p318_286.wav|||We are talking about the outskirts of London.|
034495|318-en|en|wav/p318_287.wav|||The end result is precisely the same.|
034496|318-en|en|wav/p318_288.wav|||We have it on video.|
034497|318-en|en|wav/p318_289.wav|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
034498|318-en|en|wav/p318_290.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
034499|318-en|en|wav/p318_291.wav|||It's never over until it's over.|
034500|318-en|en|wav/p318_292.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
034501|318-en|en|wav/p318_293.wav|||This year, it was a little different.|
034502|318-en|en|wav/p318_294.wav|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
034503|318-en|en|wav/p318_295.wav|||We gave them the goal.|
034504|318-en|en|wav/p318_296.wav|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
034505|318-en|en|wav/p318_297.wav|||What's the point of staying sober?|
034506|318-en|en|wav/p318_298.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
034507|318-en|en|wav/p318_299.wav|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
034508|318-en|en|wav/p318_300.wav|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
034509|318-en|en|wav/p318_301.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
034510|318-en|en|wav/p318_302.wav|||I can feel the sound inside.|
034511|318-en|en|wav/p318_303.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
034512|318-en|en|wav/p318_304.wav|||I am not a fan of books.|
034513|318-en|en|wav/p318_305.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
034514|318-en|en|wav/p318_306.wav|||It may well have been.|
034515|318-en|en|wav/p318_307.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
034516|318-en|en|wav/p318_308.wav|||It was a simple question.|
034517|318-en|en|wav/p318_309.wav|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
034518|318-en|en|wav/p318_310.wav|||And we have beaten them before.|
034519|318-en|en|wav/p318_311.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
034520|318-en|en|wav/p318_312.wav|||I am not a paedophile.|
034521|318-en|en|wav/p318_313.wav|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
034522|318-en|en|wav/p318_314.wav|||But they had to be paid for.|
034523|318-en|en|wav/p318_315.wav|||The odds are that it will.|
034524|318-en|en|wav/p318_316.wav|||But then they scored their fourth.|
034525|318-en|en|wav/p318_317.wav|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
034526|318-en|en|wav/p318_318.wav|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
034527|318-en|en|wav/p318_319.wav|||Why is that?|
034528|318-en|en|wav/p318_320.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
034529|318-en|en|wav/p318_321.wav|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
034530|318-en|en|wav/p318_322.wav|||But will they fall in love?|
034531|318-en|en|wav/p318_323.wav|||As if they ever stopped.|
034532|318-en|en|wav/p318_324.wav|||The referee had a shocking game.|

034534|318-en|en|wav/p318_326.wav|||For a few years we had good fun.|
034535|318-en|en|wav/p318_327.wav|||Medical staff are with them at the moment.|
034536|318-en|en|wav/p318_328.wav|||It went on to become an annual event.|
034537|318-en|en|wav/p318_329.wav|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
034538|318-en|en|wav/p318_330.wav|||We are now in an election period.|
034539|318-en|en|wav/p318_331.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
034540|318-en|en|wav/p318_332.wav|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
034541|318-en|en|wav/p318_333.wav|||But when we do it is great.|
034542|318-en|en|wav/p318_334.wav|||She has nothing to say to journalists.|
034543|318-en|en|wav/p318_335.wav|||I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|
034544|318-en|en|wav/p318_336.wav|||He pleaded for caution.|
034545|318-en|en|wav/p318_337.wav|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
034546|318-en|en|wav/p318_338.wav|||They've been wonderful to me.|
034547|318-en|en|wav/p318_339.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
034548|318-en|en|wav/p318_340.wav|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
034549|318-en|en|wav/p318_341.wav|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
034550|318-en|en|wav/p318_342.wav|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
034551|318-en|en|wav/p318_343.wav|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
034552|318-en|en|wav/p318_344.wav|||It's a question of perception.|
034553|318-en|en|wav/p318_345.wav|||Staff have been informed.|
034554|318-en|en|wav/p318_346.wav|||My heart is not so sure.|
034555|318-en|en|wav/p318_347.wav|||This morning was very quiet.|
034556|318-en|en|wav/p318_348.wav|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
034557|318-en|en|wav/p318_349.wav|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
034558|318-en|en|wav/p318_350.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
034559|318-en|en|wav/p318_351.wav|||That might help a bit.|
034560|318-en|en|wav/p318_352.wav|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
034561|318-en|en|wav/p318_353.wav|||He was made redundant in February last year.|
034562|318-en|en|wav/p318_354.wav|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
034563|318-en|en|wav/p318_355.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
034564|318-en|en|wav/p318_356.wav|||You have obviously got an answer to it.|
034565|318-en|en|wav/p318_357.wav|||It seems very odd.|
034566|318-en|en|wav/p318_358.wav|||Closure is not one of them.|
034567|318-en|en|wav/p318_359.wav|||The hotel was huge.|
034568|318-en|en|wav/p318_360.wav|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
034569|318-en|en|wav/p318_361.wav|||Well, you can have a tree.|
034570|318-en|en|wav/p318_362.wav|||It was the same at Twickenham.|
034571|318-en|en|wav/p318_363.wav|||This is an internal matter.|
034572|318-en|en|wav/p318_364.wav|||I am amazed at what he's done.|
034573|318-en|en|wav/p318_365.wav|||They took a risk.|
034574|318-en|en|wav/p318_366.wav|||The idea was presented to me.|
034575|318-en|en|wav/p318_367.wav|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
034576|318-en|en|wav/p318_368.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
034577|318-en|en|wav/p318_369.wav|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
034578|318-en|en|wav/p318_370.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
034579|318-en|en|wav/p318_371.wav|||I see it as my job.|
034580|318-en|en|wav/p318_372.wav|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
034581|318-en|en|wav/p318_373.wav|||Frank Warren is a great man.|
034582|318-en|en|wav/p318_374.wav|||I am a little bit tired.|
034583|318-en|en|wav/p318_375.wav|||That was never their agenda.|
034584|318-en|en|wav/p318_376.wav|||She died at her home.|
034585|318-en|en|wav/p318_377.wav|||She is currently in foster care.|
034586|318-en|en|wav/p318_378.wav|||That's the only thing that matters.|
034587|318-en|en|wav/p318_379.wav|||I enjoy the creative process.|
034588|318-en|en|wav/p318_380.wav|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
034589|318-en|en|wav/p318_381.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
034590|318-en|en|wav/p318_382.wav|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
034591|318-en|en|wav/p318_383.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
034592|318-en|en|wav/p318_384.wav|||We have been preparing all year.|
034593|318-en|en|wav/p318_385.wav|||We could learn a lot from them.|
034594|318-en|en|wav/p318_386.wav|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
034595|318-en|en|wav/p318_387.wav|||Sure, we have problems.|
034596|318-en|en|wav/p318_388.wav|||I was released after six days.|
034597|318-en|en|wav/p318_389.wav|||That time is not far away.|
034598|318-en|en|wav/p318_390.wav|||I may think about performing it.|
034599|318-en|en|wav/p318_391.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
034600|318-en|en|wav/p318_392.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
034601|318-en|en|wav/p318_393.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
034602|318-en|en|wav/p318_394.wav|||You can't go back and change things.|
034603|318-en|en|wav/p318_395.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
034604|318-en|en|wav/p318_396.wav|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
034605|318-en|en|wav/p318_397.wav|||Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|
034606|318-en|en|wav/p318_398.wav|||He says it often enough.|
034607|318-en|en|wav/p318_399.wav|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
034608|318-en|en|wav/p318_400.wav|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
034609|318-en|en|wav/p318_401.wav|||I found that much more challenging.|
034610|318-en|en|wav/p318_402.wav|||This fight is not going to go away.|
034611|318-en|en|wav/p318_403.wav|||It would have been very easily done.|
034612|318-en|en|wav/p318_404.wav|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
034613|318-en|en|wav/p318_405.wav|||The Open champion is back.|
034614|318-en|en|wav/p318_406.wav|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
034615|318-en|en|wav/p318_407.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
034616|318-en|en|wav/p318_408.wav|||I want to keep him.|
034617|318-en|en|wav/p318_409.wav|||He deserves a top team.|
034618|318-en|en|wav/p318_410.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
034619|318-en|en|wav/p318_411.wav|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
034620|318-en|en|wav/p318_412.wav|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
034621|318-en|en|wav/p318_413.wav|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
034622|318-en|en|wav/p318_414.wav|||We never agreed to it.|
034623|318-en|en|wav/p318_415.wav|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
034624|318-en|en|wav/p318_416.wav|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
034625|318-en|en|wav/p318_417.wav|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
034626|318-en|en|wav/p318_418.wav|||Would they work together again?|
034627|318-en|en|wav/p318_419.wav|||I didn't play all that well.|
034628|318-en|en|wav/p318_420.wav|||Who can tell?|
034629|318-en|en|wav/p318_421.wav|||It appears to have been closed down.|
034630|318-en|en|wav/p318_422.wav|||Now, that is a good deal.|
034631|318-en|en|wav/p318_423.wav|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
034632|318-en|en|wav/p318_424.wav|||We have no plans for direct action.|
034633|323-en|en|wav/p323_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
034634|323-en|en|wav/p323_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
034635|323-en|en|wav/p323_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
034636|323-en|en|wav/p323_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
034637|323-en|en|wav/p323_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
034638|323-en|en|wav/p323_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034639|323-en|en|wav/p323_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034640|323-en|en|wav/p323_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034641|323-en|en|wav/p323_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034642|323-en|en|wav/p323_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034643|323-en|en|wav/p323_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034644|323-en|en|wav/p323_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034645|323-en|en|wav/p323_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034646|323-en|en|wav/p323_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034647|323-en|en|wav/p323_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034648|323-en|en|wav/p323_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
034649|323-en|en|wav/p323_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034650|323-en|en|wav/p323_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034651|323-en|en|wav/p323_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034652|323-en|en|wav/p323_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034654|323-en|en|wav/p323_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034656|323-en|en|wav/p323_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034657|323-en|en|wav/p323_025.wav|||We've made a couple of albums.|
034658|323-en|en|wav/p323_026.wav|||Film music was never the same again.|
034659|323-en|en|wav/p323_027.wav|||It was a deeply moving musical experience.|
034660|323-en|en|wav/p323_028.wav|||Now it is much easier.|
034661|323-en|en|wav/p323_029.wav|||However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.|
034662|323-en|en|wav/p323_030.wav|||This is the best way to do it.|
034663|323-en|en|wav/p323_031.wav|||Its role is not to interfere.|
034664|323-en|en|wav/p323_032.wav|||Leisure centres were also affected.|
034665|323-en|en|wav/p323_033.wav|||Something happened on that island.|
034666|323-en|en|wav/p323_034.wav|||Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.|
034667|323-en|en|wav/p323_035.wav|||Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|
034668|323-en|en|wav/p323_036.wav|||It is misleading to compare the two.|
034669|323-en|en|wav/p323_037.wav|||They discussed how he might get involved.|
034670|323-en|en|wav/p323_038.wav|||And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.|
034671|323-en|en|wav/p323_039.wav|||And it had two seats.|
034672|323-en|en|wav/p323_040.wav|||They were not up to speed.|
034673|323-en|en|wav/p323_041.wav|||We know the quality of life goes up.|
034674|323-en|en|wav/p323_042.wav|||What is next?|
034675|323-en|en|wav/p323_043.wav|||Now they have found out the truth.|
034676|323-en|en|wav/p323_044.wav|||We've still got a say in this.|
034677|323-en|en|wav/p323_045.wav|||The first was excluding Sinn Fein.|
034678|323-en|en|wav/p323_046.wav|||Horses are drawn by ballot.|
034679|323-en|en|wav/p323_047.wav|||We have our supporters and our enemies.|
034680|323-en|en|wav/p323_048.wav|||Mackie was at home, unable to watch.|
034681|323-en|en|wav/p323_049.wav|||So, what's it about?|
034682|323-en|en|wav/p323_050.wav|||We have been let down by these people.|
034683|323-en|en|wav/p323_051.wav|||What's it for?|
034684|323-en|en|wav/p323_052.wav|||Nor does he have any desire to be.|
034685|323-en|en|wav/p323_053.wav|||How well did they get on?|
034686|323-en|en|wav/p323_054.wav|||I don't think it is a drawback.|
034687|323-en|en|wav/p323_055.wav|||He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|
034688|323-en|en|wav/p323_056.wav|||They may have been murdered.|
034689|323-en|en|wav/p323_057.wav|||However this weekend it will be different.|
034690|323-en|en|wav/p323_058.wav|||We didn't try hard enough, that is all.|
034691|323-en|en|wav/p323_059.wav|||It also condemned the suicide bombers.|
034692|323-en|en|wav/p323_060.wav|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
034693|323-en|en|wav/p323_061.wav|||It is very difficult.|
034694|323-en|en|wav/p323_062.wav|||This is the place to play football.|
034695|323-en|en|wav/p323_063.wav|||But it was a great decision he joked.|
034696|323-en|en|wav/p323_064.wav|||Then they killed another three.|
034697|323-en|en|wav/p323_065.wav|||What the Department of Transport will make clear.|
034698|323-en|en|wav/p323_066.wav|||The six others were injured.|
034699|323-en|en|wav/p323_067.wav|||Most of the others were in their twenties.|
034700|323-en|en|wav/p323_068.wav|||We were beaten by the better team today.|
034701|323-en|en|wav/p323_069.wav|||You need a long-term strategy in football.|
034702|323-en|en|wav/p323_070.wav|||They are not the answer to staff shortages.|
034703|323-en|en|wav/p323_071.wav|||The law has got to be upheld.|
034704|323-en|en|wav/p323_072.wav|||Advice and counselling will be offered.|
034705|323-en|en|wav/p323_073.wav|||I mean they have just been a disaster.|
034706|323-en|en|wav/p323_074.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
034707|323-en|en|wav/p323_075.wav|||That is my personal view.|
034708|323-en|en|wav/p323_076.wav|||He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.|
034709|323-en|en|wav/p323_077.wav|||I saw the explosion and panicked.|
034710|323-en|en|wav/p323_078.wav|||The protest will go ahead as planned.|
034711|323-en|en|wav/p323_079.wav|||The punishment was swift.|
034712|323-en|en|wav/p323_080.wav|||Who will run the bigger show?|
034713|323-en|en|wav/p323_081.wav|||General, You didn't get a modified.|
034714|323-en|en|wav/p323_082.wav|||It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.|
034715|323-en|en|wav/p323_083.wav|||These things just happen.|
034716|323-en|en|wav/p323_084.wav|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
034717|323-en|en|wav/p323_085.wav|||Are you up for business?|
034718|323-en|en|wav/p323_086.wav|||It's an interesting debate to get going.|
034719|323-en|en|wav/p323_087.wav|||Who does he think will win?|
034720|323-en|en|wav/p323_088.wav|||I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.|
034721|323-en|en|wav/p323_089.wav|||An announcement will follow in due course.|
034722|323-en|en|wav/p323_090.wav|||You are not in any kind of trouble.|
034723|323-en|en|wav/p323_091.wav|||It also makes for interesting viewing.|
034724|323-en|en|wav/p323_092.wav|||Will they fall out?|
034725|323-en|en|wav/p323_093.wav|||Scotland came very close in the second Test.|
034726|323-en|en|wav/p323_094.wav|||He was not able to talk to us.|
034727|323-en|en|wav/p323_095.wav|||Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|
034728|323-en|en|wav/p323_096.wav|||There is no conflict of interest.|
034729|323-en|en|wav/p323_097.wav|||They want to shut the Scottish Office.|
034730|323-en|en|wav/p323_098.wav|||They are not suitable.|
034731|323-en|en|wav/p323_099.wav|||It does seem a mystery.|
034732|323-en|en|wav/p323_100.wav|||But he is something special, is he not?|
034733|323-en|en|wav/p323_101.wav|||Club rugby refuses to die.|
034734|323-en|en|wav/p323_102.wav|||That respect is missing in the Netherlands.|
034735|323-en|en|wav/p323_103.wav|||He could look after himself, but didn't.|
034736|323-en|en|wav/p323_104.wav|||The decision was designed to shock investors.|

035257|326-en|en|wav/p326_201.wav|||It was worth a photograph.|

035259|326-en|en|wav/p326_203.wav|||For the moment, our position remains the same.|

035276|326-en|en|wav/p326_220.wav|||He was then replaced by Ross.|
035277|326-en|en|wav/p326_221.wav|||It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.|
035278|326-en|en|wav/p326_222.wav|||I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|
035279|326-en|en|wav/p326_223.wav|||She did not attend the courtroom.|

035287|326-en|en|wav/p326_231.wav|||They made it very difficult for us.|
035288|326-en|en|wav/p326_232.wav|||Well, there is a bed.|

035313|326-en|en|wav/p326_257.wav|||We would expect it to disappear in time.|
035314|326-en|en|wav/p326_258.wav|||Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.|
035315|326-en|en|wav/p326_259.wav|||I'd love to have been on the pitch.|
035316|326-en|en|wav/p326_260.wav|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
035317|326-en|en|wav/p326_261.wav|||I didn't know what he was capable of.|

035325|326-en|en|wav/p326_269.wav|||It will not be a long campaign.|

035327|326-en|en|wav/p326_271.wav|||Maybe it helps us.|
035328|326-en|en|wav/p326_272.wav|||Three bystanders were killed.|
035329|326-en|en|wav/p326_273.wav|||We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.|
035330|326-en|en|wav/p326_274.wav|||However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.|
035331|326-en|en|wav/p326_275.wav|||Was it just negligent.|

035336|326-en|en|wav/p326_280.wav|||There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.|
035337|326-en|en|wav/p326_281.wav|||Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.|
035338|326-en|en|wav/p326_282.wav|||That was enough for the committee.|

035340|326-en|en|wav/p326_284.wav|||Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.|
035341|326-en|en|wav/p326_285.wav|||In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.|
035342|326-en|en|wav/p326_286.wav|||Sure, this is a very important event for me.|
035343|326-en|en|wav/p326_287.wav|||We have to focus on what is important.|

035462|329-en|en|wav/p329_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035463|329-en|en|wav/p329_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

035711|329-en|en|wav/p329_256.wav|||And how he kept his word.|
035712|329-en|en|wav/p329_257.wav|||This is a wonderful honour for me.|
035713|329-en|en|wav/p329_258.wav|||In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.|

035886|330-en|en|wav/p330_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035887|330-en|en|wav/p330_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

035899|330-en|en|wav/p330_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
035900|330-en|en|wav/p330_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

036308|333-en|en|wav/p333_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
036309|333-en|en|wav/p333_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
036310|333-en|en|wav/p333_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

036313|333-en|en|wav/p333_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
036314|333-en|en|wav/p333_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
036315|333-en|en|wav/p333_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

036320|333-en|en|wav/p333_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
036321|333-en|en|wav/p333_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
036322|333-en|en|wav/p333_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
036323|333-en|en|wav/p333_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
036324|333-en|en|wav/p333_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
036325|333-en|en|wav/p333_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

036571|333-en|en|wav/p333_271.wav|||I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.|
036572|333-en|en|wav/p333_272.wav|||That's a very strong element.|
036573|333-en|en|wav/p333_273.wav|||How much of a cop out is that?|
036574|333-en|en|wav/p333_274.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
036575|333-en|en|wav/p333_275.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
036576|333-en|en|wav/p333_276.wav|||It's a way of making a mark.|
036577|333-en|en|wav/p333_277.wav|||Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.|
036578|333-en|en|wav/p333_278.wav|||You were the kidnappers.|
036579|333-en|en|wav/p333_279.wav|||It is a very interesting subject.|
036580|333-en|en|wav/p333_280.wav|||We know we can't rely on you.|
036581|333-en|en|wav/p333_281.wav|||Arguably, they have already done it.|
036582|333-en|en|wav/p333_282.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
036583|333-en|en|wav/p333_283.wav|||It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.|
036584|333-en|en|wav/p333_284.wav|||There is something in this.|
036585|333-en|en|wav/p333_285.wav|||I could feel the blood on my face.|
036586|333-en|en|wav/p333_286.wav|||That's why he plays for Scotland.|
036587|333-en|en|wav/p333_287.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
036588|333-en|en|wav/p333_288.wav|||It's too big a risk to take.|
036589|333-en|en|wav/p333_289.wav|||It's going to be quite a challenge.|
036590|333-en|en|wav/p333_290.wav|||I have heard the stories from Scotland.|
036591|333-en|en|wav/p333_291.wav|||It is just too long since the war.|
036592|333-en|en|wav/p333_292.wav|||My wife is totally behind me on this.|
036593|333-en|en|wav/p333_293.wav|||Debbie Harry was cool.|
036594|333-en|en|wav/p333_294.wav|||Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|
036595|333-en|en|wav/p333_295.wav|||We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.|
036596|333-en|en|wav/p333_296.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
036597|333-en|en|wav/p333_297.wav|||And sooner than we may think.|
036598|333-en|en|wav/p333_298.wav|||Raised the way you want it.|
036599|333-en|en|wav/p333_299.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
036600|333-en|en|wav/p333_300.wav|||I know you went back this morning.|
036601|333-en|en|wav/p333_301.wav|||I will carry on.|
036602|333-en|en|wav/p333_302.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
036603|333-en|en|wav/p333_303.wav|||I made a mistake.|
036604|333-en|en|wav/p333_304.wav|||It is a very special city.|
036605|333-en|en|wav/p333_305.wav|||A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|
036606|333-en|en|wav/p333_306.wav|||They certainly do not socialise.|
036607|333-en|en|wav/p333_307.wav|||It's my favourite place to hang out.|
036608|333-en|en|wav/p333_308.wav|||I think that could work to our advantage.|
036609|333-en|en|wav/p333_309.wav|||Was that not awful?|
036610|333-en|en|wav/p333_310.wav|||That was him under pressure.|
036611|333-en|en|wav/p333_311.wav|||Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|
036612|333-en|en|wav/p333_312.wav|||He will make an excellent chief inspector.|

036614|333-en|en|wav/p333_315.wav|||The Government has to grasp the nettle.|
036615|333-en|en|wav/p333_316.wav|||Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|
036616|333-en|en|wav/p333_317.wav|||I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|
036617|333-en|en|wav/p333_318.wav|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
036618|333-en|en|wav/p333_319.wav|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
036619|333-en|en|wav/p333_320.wav|||We will just get on with it.|
036620|333-en|en|wav/p333_321.wav|||We are worried about casualties.|
036621|333-en|en|wav/p333_322.wav|||This is my music.|
036622|333-en|en|wav/p333_323.wav|||I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.|
036623|333-en|en|wav/p333_324.wav|||I haven't won the world title.|
036624|333-en|en|wav/p333_325.wav|||After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|
036625|333-en|en|wav/p333_326.wav|||It's fantastic to have finally won.|
036626|333-en|en|wav/p333_327.wav|||But she's also beautiful behind the face.|
036627|333-en|en|wav/p333_328.wav|||And now he tells us.|
036628|333-en|en|wav/p333_329.wav|||I am not changing my event.|
036629|333-en|en|wav/p333_330.wav|||Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.|
036630|333-en|en|wav/p333_331.wav|||This Patton will also return.|
036631|333-en|en|wav/p333_332.wav|||That is as it may be.|
036632|333-en|en|wav/p333_333.wav|||They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|
036633|333-en|en|wav/p333_334.wav|||He came in an army uniform.|
036634|333-en|en|wav/p333_335.wav|||Eleven events are required.|
036635|333-en|en|wav/p333_336.wav|||It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|
036636|333-en|en|wav/p333_337.wav|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
036637|333-en|en|wav/p333_338.wav|||The winner will be announced by early summer.|
036638|333-en|en|wav/p333_339.wav|||I always said No.|
036639|333-en|en|wav/p333_340.wav|||The stadium was full.|
036640|333-en|en|wav/p333_341.wav|||Cinema is a communal experience.|
036641|333-en|en|wav/p333_342.wav|||So, how will it be received in the US?|
036642|333-en|en|wav/p333_343.wav|||He was different from the rest of us.|
036643|333-en|en|wav/p333_344.wav|||His name is Michael Owen.|
036644|333-en|en|wav/p333_345.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
036645|333-en|en|wav/p333_346.wav|||Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.|
036646|333-en|en|wav/p333_347.wav|||For now, we must take one game at a time.|
036647|333-en|en|wav/p333_348.wav|||So now you know.|
036648|333-en|en|wav/p333_349.wav|||But, at the same time, they made you think about life.|
036649|333-en|en|wav/p333_350.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
036650|333-en|en|wav/p333_351.wav|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|
036651|333-en|en|wav/p333_352.wav|||The feeling is awesome.|
036652|333-en|en|wav/p333_353.wav|||By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|
036653|333-en|en|wav/p333_354.wav|||Smith has not let him down.|
036654|333-en|en|wav/p333_355.wav|||We have obviously got some work to do.|
036655|333-en|en|wav/p333_356.wav|||Which he can do.|
036656|333-en|en|wav/p333_357.wav|||No, it's actually in a block of flats.|
036657|333-en|en|wav/p333_358.wav|||It has been recorded twice.|
036658|333-en|en|wav/p333_359.wav|||They were that poor.|
036659|333-en|en|wav/p333_360.wav|||And we're talking Big Money.|
036660|333-en|en|wav/p333_361.wav|||His silence on the issue is interesting.|
036661|333-en|en|wav/p333_362.wav|||They have two children.|
036662|333-en|en|wav/p333_363.wav|||With Pierre, you can never be sure.|
036663|333-en|en|wav/p333_364.wav|||Here is a tale of devotion to duty.|
036664|333-en|en|wav/p333_365.wav|||I'm really proud of my young players.|
036665|333-en|en|wav/p333_366.wav|||People buy everything with cash.|
036666|333-en|en|wav/p333_367.wav|||There was a great support all round the route.|
036667|333-en|en|wav/p333_368.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
036668|333-en|en|wav/p333_369.wav|||I felt we had fallen back a little.|
036669|333-en|en|wav/p333_370.wav|||Both managements are very supportive.|
036670|333-en|en|wav/p333_371.wav|||In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.|
036671|333-en|en|wav/p333_372.wav|||I'll go out and be aggressive.|
036672|333-en|en|wav/p333_373.wav|||This is important for two reasons.|
036673|333-en|en|wav/p333_374.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
036674|333-en|en|wav/p333_375.wav|||Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|
036675|333-en|en|wav/p333_376.wav|||You will not feel a thing.|
036676|333-en|en|wav/p333_377.wav|||It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.|
036677|333-en|en|wav/p333_378.wav|||It's not just for classical music.|
036678|333-en|en|wav/p333_379.wav|||This must be kept in total perspective.|
036679|333-en|en|wav/p333_380.wav|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
036680|333-en|en|wav/p333_381.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
036681|333-en|en|wav/p333_382.wav|||Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|
036682|333-en|en|wav/p333_383.wav|||Is that where we are?|
036683|333-en|en|wav/p333_384.wav|||We used to keep our business rates.|
036684|333-en|en|wav/p333_385.wav|||It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|
036685|333-en|en|wav/p333_386.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
036686|333-en|en|wav/p333_387.wav|||There was no energy behind it.|
036687|333-en|en|wav/p333_388.wav|||They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|
036688|333-en|en|wav/p333_389.wav|||Have we not had the rainy season already?|
036689|333-en|en|wav/p333_390.wav|||We have chosen for the patients.|
036690|333-en|en|wav/p333_391.wav|||They have not allowed them to defend themselves.|
036691|333-en|en|wav/p333_392.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
036692|333-en|en|wav/p333_393.wav|||He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.|
036693|333-en|en|wav/p333_394.wav|||If not, he should go home.|
036694|333-en|en|wav/p333_395.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
036695|333-en|en|wav/p333_396.wav|||Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|
036696|333-en|en|wav/p333_397.wav|||I get very excited by that.|
036697|333-en|en|wav/p333_398.wav|||Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.|
036698|333-en|en|wav/p333_399.wav|||In the end, it will mean an awful lot.|
036699|333-en|en|wav/p333_400.wav|||Which means it matters.|
036700|333-en|en|wav/p333_401.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
036701|333-en|en|wav/p333_402.wav|||There is a great potential on this river.|
036702|333-en|en|wav/p333_403.wav|||This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|
036703|333-en|en|wav/p333_404.wav|||She said he showed no remorse.|
036704|333-en|en|wav/p333_405.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
036705|333-en|en|wav/p333_406.wav|||After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.|
036706|333-en|en|wav/p333_407.wav|||However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.|
036707|333-en|en|wav/p333_408.wav|||There's nothing for you here.|
036708|333-en|en|wav/p333_409.wav|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
036709|333-en|en|wav/p333_410.wav|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
036710|333-en|en|wav/p333_411.wav|||It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|
036711|333-en|en|wav/p333_412.wav|||I have not come in to take over.|
036712|333-en|en|wav/p333_413.wav|||Is this accurate?|
036713|333-en|en|wav/p333_414.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
036714|333-en|en|wav/p333_415.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
036715|333-en|en|wav/p333_416.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
036716|333-en|en|wav/p333_417.wav|||The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.|
036717|333-en|en|wav/p333_418.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
036718|333-en|en|wav/p333_419.wav|||They were in good humour, too.|
036719|333-en|en|wav/p333_420.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
036720|333-en|en|wav/p333_421.wav|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
036721|333-en|en|wav/p333_422.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
036722|333-en|en|wav/p333_423.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
036723|333-en|en|wav/p333_424.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|
036724|334-en|en|wav/p334_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
036725|334-en|en|wav/p334_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
036726|334-en|en|wav/p334_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
036727|334-en|en|wav/p334_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
036728|334-en|en|wav/p334_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
036729|334-en|en|wav/p334_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
036730|334-en|en|wav/p334_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
036731|334-en|en|wav/p334_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
036732|334-en|en|wav/p334_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
036733|334-en|en|wav/p334_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
036734|334-en|en|wav/p334_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
036735|334-en|en|wav/p334_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
036736|334-en|en|wav/p334_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
036737|334-en|en|wav/p334_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
036738|334-en|en|wav/p334_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
036739|334-en|en|wav/p334_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
036740|334-en|en|wav/p334_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
036741|334-en|en|wav/p334_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
036742|334-en|en|wav/p334_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
036743|334-en|en|wav/p334_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
036744|334-en|en|wav/p334_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
036745|334-en|en|wav/p334_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
036746|334-en|en|wav/p334_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
036747|334-en|en|wav/p334_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
036748|334-en|en|wav/p334_025.wav|||A judicial review is also being considered.|
036749|334-en|en|wav/p334_026.wav|||I want to win this thing.|
036750|334-en|en|wav/p334_027.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
036751|334-en|en|wav/p334_028.wav|||I'd just like to play.|
036752|334-en|en|wav/p334_029.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
036753|334-en|en|wav/p334_030.wav|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
036754|334-en|en|wav/p334_031.wav|||It was no surprise.|
036755|334-en|en|wav/p334_032.wav|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
036756|334-en|en|wav/p334_033.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
036757|334-en|en|wav/p334_034.wav|||Appointed general secretary last September.|

036759|334-en|en|wav/p334_036.wav|||We could feel the heat.|
036760|334-en|en|wav/p334_037.wav|||Darrell was, however, adamant.|
036761|334-en|en|wav/p334_038.wav|||He was a member of the Tartan Army.|
036762|334-en|en|wav/p334_039.wav|||I think it can count against you now.|
036763|334-en|en|wav/p334_040.wav|||I wanted to win so badly.|
036764|334-en|en|wav/p334_041.wav|||It was an accounting error.|
036765|334-en|en|wav/p334_042.wav|||I had enough on.|
036766|334-en|en|wav/p334_043.wav|||The offer of help is there for anyone.|
036767|334-en|en|wav/p334_044.wav|||There were no passengers on board.|
036768|334-en|en|wav/p334_045.wav|||And we're not there yet.|
036769|334-en|en|wav/p334_046.wav|||No meaningful response was issued.|
036770|334-en|en|wav/p334_047.wav|||And the funny thing is, they usually do.|
036771|334-en|en|wav/p334_048.wav|||Times have changed, but have they improved?|
036772|334-en|en|wav/p334_049.wav|||Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|
036773|334-en|en|wav/p334_050.wav|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
036774|334-en|en|wav/p334_051.wav|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
036775|334-en|en|wav/p334_052.wav|||It is a form of physical exercise.|
036776|334-en|en|wav/p334_053.wav|||plays in dark blue.|
036777|334-en|en|wav/p334_054.wav|||But, by that time, of course, it is again.|
036778|334-en|en|wav/p334_055.wav|||It is something that we will put right.|
036779|334-en|en|wav/p334_056.wav|||Why do it?|
036780|334-en|en|wav/p334_057.wav|||It could take three days.|
036781|334-en|en|wav/p334_058.wav|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
036782|334-en|en|wav/p334_059.wav|||It was totally my fault.|
036783|334-en|en|wav/p334_060.wav|||Or so everyone believed.|
036784|334-en|en|wav/p334_061.wav|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
036785|334-en|en|wav/p334_062.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
036786|334-en|en|wav/p334_063.wav|||Tomorrow night is the important game.|
036787|334-en|en|wav/p334_064.wav|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
036788|334-en|en|wav/p334_065.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
036789|334-en|en|wav/p334_066.wav|||Every aspect of our play was first class.|
036790|334-en|en|wav/p334_067.wav|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
036791|334-en|en|wav/p334_068.wav|||It was a move which appealed to him.|
036792|334-en|en|wav/p334_069.wav|||There is a tunnel after the tunnel.|
036793|334-en|en|wav/p334_070.wav|||He will need that machine.|
036794|334-en|en|wav/p334_071.wav|||But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.|
036795|334-en|en|wav/p334_072.wav|||We are looking for volunteers.|
036796|334-en|en|wav/p334_073.wav|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
036797|334-en|en|wav/p334_074.wav|||It was very personal and very intimate.|
036798|334-en|en|wav/p334_075.wav|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
036799|334-en|en|wav/p334_076.wav|||I was inspired by two things.|
036800|334-en|en|wav/p334_077.wav|||They follow him everywhere.|
036801|334-en|en|wav/p334_078.wav|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
036802|334-en|en|wav/p334_079.wav|||Maybe that was the whole point.|
036803|334-en|en|wav/p334_080.wav|||The feeling between the two men was mutual.|
036804|334-en|en|wav/p334_081.wav|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
036805|334-en|en|wav/p334_082.wav|||So we said, no, we're not going to do that.|
036806|334-en|en|wav/p334_083.wav|||This must be really short of ideas.|
036807|334-en|en|wav/p334_084.wav|||It was extremely cold.|
036808|334-en|en|wav/p334_085.wav|||They use them for everything.|
036809|334-en|en|wav/p334_086.wav|||We have the easy part.|
036810|334-en|en|wav/p334_087.wav|||I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.|
036811|334-en|en|wav/p334_088.wav|||They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.|
036812|334-en|en|wav/p334_089.wav|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
036813|334-en|en|wav/p334_090.wav|||Mr Miller is married with three children.|
036814|334-en|en|wav/p334_091.wav|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
036815|334-en|en|wav/p334_092.wav|||We already have them, all over Europe.|
036816|334-en|en|wav/p334_093.wav|||There are a lot of unanswered questions.|
036817|334-en|en|wav/p334_094.wav|||Libya is an easy target.|
036818|334-en|en|wav/p334_095.wav|||I thought they played very well.|
036819|334-en|en|wav/p334_096.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
036820|334-en|en|wav/p334_097.wav|||It means they actually control the programme.|
036821|334-en|en|wav/p334_098.wav|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
036822|334-en|en|wav/p334_099.wav|||They chose to side with terror.|
036823|334-en|en|wav/p334_100.wav|||Justice was not seen today.|
036824|334-en|en|wav/p334_101.wav|||I would never even consider it.|
036825|334-en|en|wav/p334_102.wav|||Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.|
036826|334-en|en|wav/p334_103.wav|||We should just say no.|
036827|334-en|en|wav/p334_104.wav|||We are not out of touch with politics.|
036828|334-en|en|wav/p334_105.wav|||That was a gold medal for certain.|
036829|334-en|en|wav/p334_106.wav|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
036830|334-en|en|wav/p334_107.wav|||I didn't make those adjustments.|
036831|334-en|en|wav/p334_108.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
036832|334-en|en|wav/p334_109.wav|||We have it on video.|
036833|334-en|en|wav/p334_110.wav|||Sounds like The Sixth Sense?|
036834|334-en|en|wav/p334_111.wav|||There is an element of racism in Scotland.|
036835|334-en|en|wav/p334_112.wav|||It didn't take long.|
036836|334-en|en|wav/p334_113.wav|||This meeting is the path to salvation.|
036837|334-en|en|wav/p334_114.wav|||Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.|
036838|334-en|en|wav/p334_115.wav|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
036839|334-en|en|wav/p334_116.wav|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
036840|334-en|en|wav/p334_117.wav|||He told the conference.|
036841|334-en|en|wav/p334_118.wav|||The sanctions are about collective punishment.|
036842|334-en|en|wav/p334_119.wav|||We tend to come good at the end.|
036843|334-en|en|wav/p334_120.wav|||He also received a medal of honour.|
036844|334-en|en|wav/p334_121.wav|||It's not one for the purist.|
036845|334-en|en|wav/p334_122.wav|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
036846|334-en|en|wav/p334_123.wav|||For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.|
036847|334-en|en|wav/p334_124.wav|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
036848|334-en|en|wav/p334_125.wav|||There is bound to be a formal complaint.|
036849|334-en|en|wav/p334_126.wav|||It is a time bomb.|
036850|334-en|en|wav/p334_127.wav|||It's a matter of huge concern.|
036851|334-en|en|wav/p334_128.wav|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
036852|334-en|en|wav/p334_129.wav|||We are taking advice on this.|
036853|334-en|en|wav/p334_130.wav|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
036854|334-en|en|wav/p334_131.wav|||It was just an accident of birth.|
036855|334-en|en|wav/p334_132.wav|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
036856|334-en|en|wav/p334_133.wav|||It was a simple question.|
036857|334-en|en|wav/p334_134.wav|||Some of his family still live there.|
036858|334-en|en|wav/p334_135.wav|||I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.|
036859|334-en|en|wav/p334_136.wav|||By that time, however, it was already too late.|
036860|334-en|en|wav/p334_137.wav|||Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?|
036861|334-en|en|wav/p334_138.wav|||Could you put it in writing?|
036862|334-en|en|wav/p334_139.wav|||This is the New Edinburgh.|
036863|334-en|en|wav/p334_140.wav|||We all thought we were going to die.|
036864|334-en|en|wav/p334_141.wav|||And that's good news for the magpies.|
036865|334-en|en|wav/p334_142.wav|||That will come after the game on Saturday.|
036866|334-en|en|wav/p334_143.wav|||Our offer will remain on the table.|
036867|334-en|en|wav/p334_144.wav|||The world is split into two.|
036868|334-en|en|wav/p334_145.wav|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
036869|334-en|en|wav/p334_146.wav|||I would ask the fans to be patient.|
036870|334-en|en|wav/p334_147.wav|||It was so physical.|
036871|334-en|en|wav/p334_148.wav|||Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.|
036872|334-en|en|wav/p334_149.wav|||He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.|
036873|334-en|en|wav/p334_150.wav|||Why is that?|
036874|334-en|en|wav/p334_151.wav|||It is extremely sad.|
036875|334-en|en|wav/p334_153.wav|||Europe is a hugely contentious issue.|
036876|334-en|en|wav/p334_154.wav|||It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.|
036877|334-en|en|wav/p334_155.wav|||And therein lies the whole problem.|
036878|334-en|en|wav/p334_156.wav|||He was not deterred.|
036879|334-en|en|wav/p334_157.wav|||This commitment should be built upon.|
036880|334-en|en|wav/p334_158.wav|||This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.|
036881|334-en|en|wav/p334_159.wav|||The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|
036882|334-en|en|wav/p334_160.wav|||That is not just my personal view.|
036883|334-en|en|wav/p334_161.wav|||The investment will be in the food.|
036884|334-en|en|wav/p334_162.wav|||But he was a full, working member of our staff.|
036885|334-en|en|wav/p334_163.wav|||The problem is the pitch.|
036886|334-en|en|wav/p334_164.wav|||That's as it should be.|
036887|334-en|en|wav/p334_165.wav|||It does seem a mystery.|
036888|334-en|en|wav/p334_166.wav|||Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|
036889|334-en|en|wav/p334_167.wav|||He looked very sharp.|
036890|334-en|en|wav/p334_168.wav|||The fate of large numbers remains unknown.|
036891|334-en|en|wav/p334_169.wav|||Two of the team became ill.|
036892|334-en|en|wav/p334_170.wav|||We have taken steps to rectify it.|
036893|334-en|en|wav/p334_171.wav|||I see no need for change.|
036894|334-en|en|wav/p334_172.wav|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
036895|334-en|en|wav/p334_173.wav|||But the Premiership is everything to us.|
036896|334-en|en|wav/p334_174.wav|||Do yourselves a favour.|
036897|334-en|en|wav/p334_175.wav|||Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.|
036898|334-en|en|wav/p334_176.wav|||But we have come under attack.|
036899|334-en|en|wav/p334_177.wav|||The new system will be marketed this summer.|
036900|334-en|en|wav/p334_178.wav|||What do they do, anyway?|
036901|334-en|en|wav/p334_179.wav|||He was just like a godfather to it.|
036902|334-en|en|wav/p334_180.wav|||I'd love to be like Peter.|
036903|334-en|en|wav/p334_181.wav|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
036904|334-en|en|wav/p334_182.wav|||Lord Johnston will give a decision later.|
036905|334-en|en|wav/p334_183.wav|||That is his attitude to things.|
036906|334-en|en|wav/p334_184.wav|||Then came the collision with Sergio.|
036907|334-en|en|wav/p334_185.wav|||And what was that like, as an experience?|
036908|334-en|en|wav/p334_186.wav|||Thirteen people will be made redundant.|
036909|334-en|en|wav/p334_187.wav|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
036910|334-en|en|wav/p334_188.wav|||No finals are to be contested today.|
036911|334-en|en|wav/p334_189.wav|||This is not a struggle against Islam.|
036912|334-en|en|wav/p334_190.wav|||That night was a terrible muddle.|
036913|334-en|en|wav/p334_191.wav|||His English counterpart agreed.|
036914|334-en|en|wav/p334_192.wav|||Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.|
036915|334-en|en|wav/p334_193.wav|||It is in our own hands.|
036916|334-en|en|wav/p334_194.wav|||This is a step backwards.|
036917|334-en|en|wav/p334_195.wav|||We may make a short-term appointment.|
036918|334-en|en|wav/p334_196.wav|||He will address the nation this evening.|
036919|334-en|en|wav/p334_197.wav|||Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.|
036920|334-en|en|wav/p334_198.wav|||I'm not changing my mind.|
036921|334-en|en|wav/p334_199.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
036922|334-en|en|wav/p334_200.wav|||We believe that the reason is poverty.|
036923|334-en|en|wav/p334_201.wav|||Tony Blair is obviously panicking.|
036924|334-en|en|wav/p334_202.wav|||We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.|
036925|334-en|en|wav/p334_203.wav|||The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.|
036926|334-en|en|wav/p334_204.wav|||I'm trying to stay open on that.|
036927|334-en|en|wav/p334_205.wav|||They serve a multitude of purposes.|
036928|334-en|en|wav/p334_206.wav|||We'll have to work hard today.|
036929|334-en|en|wav/p334_207.wav|||The frustration was showing.|
036930|334-en|en|wav/p334_208.wav|||Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.|
036931|334-en|en|wav/p334_209.wav|||It is the stop-gap before extinction.|
036932|334-en|en|wav/p334_210.wav|||You have obviously got an answer to it.|
036933|334-en|en|wav/p334_211.wav|||My friends were very envious.|
036934|334-en|en|wav/p334_212.wav|||But who cares?|
036935|334-en|en|wav/p334_213.wav|||The house was full of smoke.|
036936|334-en|en|wav/p334_214.wav|||The approval system will be changed.|
036937|334-en|en|wav/p334_215.wav|||So the European elections are extremely important.|
036938|334-en|en|wav/p334_216.wav|||Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.|
036939|334-en|en|wav/p334_217.wav|||That period was a struggle.|
036940|334-en|en|wav/p334_218.wav|||We are determined to establish the facts.|
036941|334-en|en|wav/p334_219.wav|||You just have to accept.|
036942|334-en|en|wav/p334_220.wav|||We must improve our relations with government.|
036943|334-en|en|wav/p334_221.wav|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
036944|334-en|en|wav/p334_222.wav|||The list is too long for this piece.|
036945|334-en|en|wav/p334_223.wav|||If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|
036946|334-en|en|wav/p334_224.wav|||I can't blame the fans.|
036947|334-en|en|wav/p334_225.wav|||That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|
036948|334-en|en|wav/p334_226.wav|||Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.|
036949|334-en|en|wav/p334_227.wav|||But that attachment took a lot of growing.|
036950|334-en|en|wav/p334_228.wav|||This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.|
036951|334-en|en|wav/p334_229.wav|||However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|
036952|334-en|en|wav/p334_230.wav|||So far they have refused.|
036953|334-en|en|wav/p334_231.wav|||He is adamant that he is innocent.|
036954|334-en|en|wav/p334_232.wav|||To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.|
036955|334-en|en|wav/p334_233.wav|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
036956|334-en|en|wav/p334_234.wav|||He took my breath away.|
036957|334-en|en|wav/p334_235.wav|||It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.|
036958|334-en|en|wav/p334_236.wav|||I will have to order its destruction.|
036959|334-en|en|wav/p334_237.wav|||After that it is up to the boss.|
036960|334-en|en|wav/p334_238.wav|||I never wanted a legal battle.|
036961|334-en|en|wav/p334_239.wav|||This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.|
036962|334-en|en|wav/p334_240.wav|||Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.|
036963|334-en|en|wav/p334_241.wav|||It had won an investors in people award.|
036964|334-en|en|wav/p334_242.wav|||A venue was found.|
036965|334-en|en|wav/p334_243.wav|||They are not an item.|

037090|334-en|en|wav/p334_368.wav|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
037091|334-en|en|wav/p334_369.wav|||This gives a financial incentive to switch.|

037151|335-en|en|wav/p335_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
037152|335-en|en|wav/p335_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037153|335-en|en|wav/p335_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037154|335-en|en|wav/p335_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037155|335-en|en|wav/p335_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037156|335-en|en|wav/p335_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

037163|335-en|en|wav/p335_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
037164|335-en|en|wav/p335_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
037165|335-en|en|wav/p335_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|

037578|336-en|en|wav/p336_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037579|336-en|en|wav/p336_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037580|336-en|en|wav/p336_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037581|336-en|en|wav/p336_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
037582|336-en|en|wav/p336_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
037583|336-en|en|wav/p336_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
037584|336-en|en|wav/p336_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
037585|336-en|en|wav/p336_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
037586|336-en|en|wav/p336_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
037587|336-en|en|wav/p336_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
037588|336-en|en|wav/p336_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
037589|336-en|en|wav/p336_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
037590|336-en|en|wav/p336_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
037592|336-en|en|wav/p336_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
037593|336-en|en|wav/p336_025.wav|||I am very happy with the result.|
037594|336-en|en|wav/p336_026.wav|||She took them for a term.|
037595|336-en|en|wav/p336_027.wav|||It is deeply worrying.|
037596|336-en|en|wav/p336_028.wav|||This is a very interesting move.|
037597|336-en|en|wav/p336_029.wav|||Are we not men?|
037598|336-en|en|wav/p336_030.wav|||How could it not?|
037599|336-en|en|wav/p336_031.wav|||It is sending the wrong message to people.|
037600|336-en|en|wav/p336_032.wav|||Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.|
037601|336-en|en|wav/p336_033.wav|||We are proud of them.|
037602|336-en|en|wav/p336_034.wav|||We had a really good experience with David.|
037603|336-en|en|wav/p336_035.wav|||It was another good idea.|
037604|336-en|en|wav/p336_036.wav|||I want to make a vigorous defence.|
037605|336-en|en|wav/p336_037.wav|||That incident altered the pattern of the game.|
037606|336-en|en|wav/p336_038.wav|||IT is a terrible equation.|
037607|336-en|en|wav/p336_039.wav|||That gives us something to kick against.|
037608|336-en|en|wav/p336_040.wav|||It was pretty special.|
037609|336-en|en|wav/p336_041.wav|||Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.|
037610|336-en|en|wav/p336_042.wav|||I should say so.|
037611|336-en|en|wav/p336_043.wav|||Yet therein is the problem.|
037612|336-en|en|wav/p336_044.wav|||This isn't a new problem.|
037613|336-en|en|wav/p336_045.wav|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
037614|336-en|en|wav/p336_046.wav|||My office is down there.|
037615|336-en|en|wav/p336_047.wav|||There can be no dispute about our history.|
037616|336-en|en|wav/p336_048.wav|||The crowd was waiting.|
037617|336-en|en|wav/p336_049.wav|||It was a joy.|
037618|336-en|en|wav/p336_050.wav|||It's the same with cinema.|
037619|336-en|en|wav/p336_051.wav|||It was the climax of the thing.|
037620|336-en|en|wav/p336_052.wav|||He died from multiple injuries.|
037621|336-en|en|wav/p336_053.wav|||It is nearly there.|
037622|336-en|en|wav/p336_054.wav|||I'm going to buy a car.|
037623|336-en|en|wav/p336_055.wav|||We said, What do you mean?|
037624|336-en|en|wav/p336_056.wav|||I have been there many times.|
037625|336-en|en|wav/p336_057.wav|||The crackdown is launched today by the government.|
037626|336-en|en|wav/p336_058.wav|||This ruling is a farce.|
037627|336-en|en|wav/p336_059.wav|||They enjoy playing the game.|
037628|336-en|en|wav/p336_060.wav|||It was rather a distorted image of Islam.|
037629|336-en|en|wav/p336_061.wav|||It is not standing army.|
037630|336-en|en|wav/p336_062.wav|||It was a crucial moment.|
037631|336-en|en|wav/p336_063.wav|||Someone else has now got them.|
037632|336-en|en|wav/p336_064.wav|||The second is freedom.|
037633|336-en|en|wav/p336_065.wav|||I let go the telephone and ran.|
037634|336-en|en|wav/p336_066.wav|||Get used to it.|
037635|336-en|en|wav/p336_067.wav|||For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.|
037636|336-en|en|wav/p336_068.wav|||Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.|
037637|336-en|en|wav/p336_069.wav|||After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.|
037638|336-en|en|wav/p336_070.wav|||Sadly, in this case, that was not so.|
037639|336-en|en|wav/p336_071.wav|||The hearing was continued until a later date.|
037640|336-en|en|wav/p336_072.wav|||Still, some additions are inspired.|
037641|336-en|en|wav/p336_073.wav|||Any error is severely punished.|
037642|336-en|en|wav/p336_074.wav|||Yet what is supposed to be said?|
037643|336-en|en|wav/p336_075.wav|||But we will learn from that.|
037644|336-en|en|wav/p336_076.wav|||He has not created a Festival resource.|
037645|336-en|en|wav/p336_077.wav|||We couldn't afford it.|
037646|336-en|en|wav/p336_078.wav|||I get the bus.|
037647|336-en|en|wav/p336_079.wav|||I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.|
037648|336-en|en|wav/p336_080.wav|||Frankly, we should all have such problems.|
037649|336-en|en|wav/p336_081.wav|||The issues are not going to change.|
037650|336-en|en|wav/p336_082.wav|||Four minutes later, the show was over.|
037651|336-en|en|wav/p336_083.wav|||Would you have ever believed that was possible?|
037652|336-en|en|wav/p336_084.wav|||It will be easier for us.|
037653|336-en|en|wav/p336_085.wav|||I don't think it is.|
037654|336-en|en|wav/p336_086.wav|||There are no other contenders.|
037655|336-en|en|wav/p336_087.wav|||On that they agree.|
037656|336-en|en|wav/p336_088.wav|||They failed to reach agreement yesterday.|
037657|336-en|en|wav/p336_089.wav|||But who was driving it?|
037658|336-en|en|wav/p336_090.wav|||We have to get this sorted out.|
037659|336-en|en|wav/p336_091.wav|||It was very fast.|
037660|336-en|en|wav/p336_092.wav|||Singing is my first love.|
037661|336-en|en|wav/p336_093.wav|||When is it ever anything else?|
037662|336-en|en|wav/p336_094.wav|||It's hard to see it.|
037663|336-en|en|wav/p336_095.wav|||I believe in trade unions.|
037664|336-en|en|wav/p336_096.wav|||Sub Not Used, Mackay.|
037665|336-en|en|wav/p336_097.wav|||This is in a league of its own.|
037666|336-en|en|wav/p336_098.wav|||The partnership was set up during the summer.|
037667|336-en|en|wav/p336_099.wav|||That statement has never been withdrawn.|
037668|336-en|en|wav/p336_100.wav|||The supporters gave us a lot of passion.|
037669|336-en|en|wav/p336_101.wav|||That is unlikely to happen.|
037670|336-en|en|wav/p336_102.wav|||That is a mark of what you are.|
037671|336-en|en|wav/p336_103.wav|||This is not finished.|
037672|336-en|en|wav/p336_104.wav|||It was one of the firemen.|
037673|336-en|en|wav/p336_105.wav|||Now, she has completed a family tradition.|
037674|336-en|en|wav/p336_106.wav|||Don't you believe it.|
037675|336-en|en|wav/p336_107.wav|||There is another important factor.|
037676|336-en|en|wav/p336_108.wav|||Most people know that.|
037677|336-en|en|wav/p336_109.wav|||I want to keep playing.|
037678|336-en|en|wav/p336_110.wav|||At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.|
037679|336-en|en|wav/p336_111.wav|||The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.|
037680|336-en|en|wav/p336_112.wav|||That is how we will be judged.|
037681|336-en|en|wav/p336_113.wav|||It's there for people to look at.|
037682|336-en|en|wav/p336_114.wav|||We are getting there.|
037683|336-en|en|wav/p336_115.wav|||I just couldn't believe what had happened.|
037684|336-en|en|wav/p336_116.wav|||They never got into the show this time.|
037685|336-en|en|wav/p336_117.wav|||He, too, is keen to redress the balance.|
037686|336-en|en|wav/p336_118.wav|||But no, it's not funny.|
037687|336-en|en|wav/p336_119.wav|||We just try to make great records.|
037688|336-en|en|wav/p336_120.wav|||It's almost certainly not going to help.|
037689|336-en|en|wav/p336_121.wav|||Why does it come out now?|
037690|336-en|en|wav/p336_122.wav|||In that case, the children were not missing.|
037691|336-en|en|wav/p336_123.wav|||These figures are truly awful.|
037692|336-en|en|wav/p336_124.wav|||The whole thing was just unreal.|
037693|336-en|en|wav/p336_125.wav|||They haven't been thought through.|
037694|336-en|en|wav/p336_126.wav|||They have their own audience in Edinburgh.|
037695|336-en|en|wav/p336_127.wav|||It's better than that, it's fantastic.|
037696|336-en|en|wav/p336_128.wav|||The criteria have changed.|
037697|336-en|en|wav/p336_129.wav|||Everyone in front of me was dead.|
037698|336-en|en|wav/p336_130.wav|||Audacious decisions were taken early on.|
037699|336-en|en|wav/p336_131.wav|||I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
037700|336-en|en|wav/p336_132.wav|||I just have no maternal instincts.|
037701|336-en|en|wav/p336_133.wav|||It has been declared.|
037702|336-en|en|wav/p336_134.wav|||His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.|
037703|336-en|en|wav/p336_135.wav|||Clearly, audiences are unsettled.|
037704|336-en|en|wav/p336_136.wav|||It's very hard to plan for it.|
037705|336-en|en|wav/p336_137.wav|||There is nothing like this back home.|
037706|336-en|en|wav/p336_138.wav|||They are declining elsewhere in the UK.|
037707|336-en|en|wav/p336_139.wav|||He is that good.|
037708|336-en|en|wav/p336_140.wav|||We did not have a clue.|
037709|336-en|en|wav/p336_141.wav|||We need to be more specific.|
037710|336-en|en|wav/p336_142.wav|||This is the man who provides the hope.|
037711|336-en|en|wav/p336_143.wav|||This is a war over our home.|
037712|336-en|en|wav/p336_144.wav|||He's got me very well.|
037713|336-en|en|wav/p336_145.wav|||He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.|
037714|336-en|en|wav/p336_146.wav|||He was always nice to me.|
037715|336-en|en|wav/p336_147.wav|||He looked at me before replying.|
037716|336-en|en|wav/p336_148.wav|||Then there is the Mini itself.|
037717|336-en|en|wav/p336_149.wav|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
037718|336-en|en|wav/p336_150.wav|||It's good for the city.|
037719|336-en|en|wav/p336_151.wav|||The only answer is a public inquiry.|
037720|336-en|en|wav/p336_152.wav|||Controllers major concern is safety.|
037721|336-en|en|wav/p336_153.wav|||It's like an extension of your body.|
037722|336-en|en|wav/p336_154.wav|||Because he usually is.|
037723|336-en|en|wav/p336_155.wav|||It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.|
037724|336-en|en|wav/p336_156.wav|||We have waited a long time for this.|
037725|336-en|en|wav/p336_157.wav|||I want my audience to be challenged.|
037726|336-en|en|wav/p336_158.wav|||This is the culture change in medicine.|
037727|336-en|en|wav/p336_159.wav|||Who do you think you are?|
037728|336-en|en|wav/p336_160.wav|||Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.|
037729|336-en|en|wav/p336_161.wav|||I have no battle with the Scots.|
037730|336-en|en|wav/p336_162.wav|||I hope he gets it.|
037731|336-en|en|wav/p336_163.wav|||Everything has its place and purpose.|
037732|336-en|en|wav/p336_164.wav|||Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.|
037733|336-en|en|wav/p336_165.wav|||I am here to work for Scottish Labour.|
037734|336-en|en|wav/p336_166.wav|||Nobody could survive on that.|
037735|336-en|en|wav/p336_167.wav|||I can't do anything before nine.|
037736|336-en|en|wav/p336_168.wav|||Their vision was not impeded.|
037737|336-en|en|wav/p336_169.wav|||He is married with three children.|
037738|336-en|en|wav/p336_170.wav|||These days will be back.|
037739|336-en|en|wav/p336_171.wav|||However, they should not come as a surprise.|
037740|336-en|en|wav/p336_172.wav|||It could last five months.|
037741|336-en|en|wav/p336_173.wav|||Everything is accounted for.|
037742|336-en|en|wav/p336_174.wav|||The support from the general public was astounding.|
037743|336-en|en|wav/p336_175.wav|||About time too, you might think.|
037744|336-en|en|wav/p336_176.wav|||However, it does not tell the full story.|
037745|336-en|en|wav/p336_177.wav|||We have made mistakes and were badly punished.|
037746|336-en|en|wav/p336_178.wav|||The bombing has had a huge influence.|
037747|336-en|en|wav/p336_179.wav|||We've got a mixture of both.|
037748|336-en|en|wav/p336_180.wav|||I'm very happy to be here.|
037749|336-en|en|wav/p336_181.wav|||This is not the case.|
037750|336-en|en|wav/p336_182.wav|||This one was supposed to be so different.|
037751|336-en|en|wav/p336_183.wav|||I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|
037752|336-en|en|wav/p336_184.wav|||It has been difficult for her to do, he says.|
037753|336-en|en|wav/p336_185.wav|||They are now out in the cold.|
037754|336-en|en|wav/p336_186.wav|||However, planners should be taking the lead.|
037755|336-en|en|wav/p336_187.wav|||Cloning is not ready.|
037756|336-en|en|wav/p336_188.wav|||New Labour are running scared.|
037757|336-en|en|wav/p336_189.wav|||It is a good result for Great Britain.|
037758|336-en|en|wav/p336_190.wav|||The weekly average was three hours.|
037759|336-en|en|wav/p336_191.wav|||Is there a new way forward?|
037760|336-en|en|wav/p336_192.wav|||Don't hold your breath!|
037761|336-en|en|wav/p336_193.wav|||This is the start of a slippery slope.|
037762|336-en|en|wav/p336_194.wav|||Where do you think she is going?|
037763|336-en|en|wav/p336_195.wav|||Safety is our first concern.|
037764|336-en|en|wav/p336_196.wav|||In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|
037765|336-en|en|wav/p336_197.wav|||Inspections are not the problem.|
037766|336-en|en|wav/p336_198.wav|||But who will buy it?|
037767|336-en|en|wav/p336_199.wav|||And it's more subversive.|
037768|336-en|en|wav/p336_200.wav|||Openness is always the best way.|
037769|336-en|en|wav/p336_201.wav|||It wouldn't go off.|
037770|336-en|en|wav/p336_202.wav|||I've been enjoying it, though.|
037771|336-en|en|wav/p336_203.wav|||The professor said the results were positive.|
037772|336-en|en|wav/p336_204.wav|||I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|
037773|336-en|en|wav/p336_205.wav|||It's part of the end game.|
037774|336-en|en|wav/p336_206.wav|||Do they play for the money?|
037775|336-en|en|wav/p336_207.wav|||The train was on time.|
037776|336-en|en|wav/p336_208.wav|||So, where do we go from here?|
037777|336-en|en|wav/p336_209.wav|||The claim was denied by the first minister.|
037778|336-en|en|wav/p336_210.wav|||More than that, it's a vicious circle.|
037779|336-en|en|wav/p336_211.wav|||And how much of a compliment is that?|
037780|336-en|en|wav/p336_213.wav|||Politics is a tough game.|
037781|336-en|en|wav/p336_214.wav|||I have friends in Glasgow.|
037782|336-en|en|wav/p336_215.wav|||What has changed?|
037783|336-en|en|wav/p336_216.wav|||There's nothing to be gained by it.|
037784|336-en|en|wav/p336_217.wav|||Chambers said he would accept the place.|
037785|336-en|en|wav/p336_218.wav|||We have been through this with the lawyers.|
037786|336-en|en|wav/p336_219.wav|||I'm not interested in the job.|
037787|336-en|en|wav/p336_220.wav|||His contract was then not renewed.|
037788|336-en|en|wav/p336_221.wav|||Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|
037789|336-en|en|wav/p336_222.wav|||The warnings were a good reminder.|
037790|336-en|en|wav/p336_223.wav|||I came here this week to work.|
037791|336-en|en|wav/p336_224.wav|||It's the last thing on my mind.|
037792|336-en|en|wav/p336_225.wav|||Barry Ferguson is one of them.|
037793|336-en|en|wav/p336_226.wav|||The biggest resource is our staff.|
037794|336-en|en|wav/p336_227.wav|||We have big ideas.|
037795|336-en|en|wav/p336_228.wav|||How will we get there?|
037796|336-en|en|wav/p336_229.wav|||She told me to stop.|
037797|336-en|en|wav/p336_230.wav|||I wish him well for the future.|
037798|336-en|en|wav/p336_231.wav|||Cars are great for going long distances.|
037799|336-en|en|wav/p336_232.wav|||It's not a party, no, no.|
037800|336-en|en|wav/p336_233.wav|||The lads are having a tour.|
037801|336-en|en|wav/p336_234.wav|||It may not be life long.|
037802|336-en|en|wav/p336_235.wav|||Everyone was in tears.|
037803|336-en|en|wav/p336_236.wav|||It was just above the roof.|
037804|336-en|en|wav/p336_237.wav|||These were the dreams.|
037805|336-en|en|wav/p336_238.wav|||But we must work in harmony.|
037806|336-en|en|wav/p336_239.wav|||It's a bit like a bereavement.|
037807|336-en|en|wav/p336_240.wav|||There is no other way.|
037808|336-en|en|wav/p336_241.wav|||Everyone must be focused on the league.|
037809|336-en|en|wav/p336_242.wav|||The English are coming.|
037810|336-en|en|wav/p336_243.wav|||You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.|
037811|336-en|en|wav/p336_244.wav|||I believe in theatre.|
037812|336-en|en|wav/p336_245.wav|||Only four of his passengers were uninjured.|
037813|336-en|en|wav/p336_246.wav|||It's time to say enough is enough.|
037814|336-en|en|wav/p336_247.wav|||He has to pull back from the brink.|
037815|336-en|en|wav/p336_248.wav|||She has insisted she did nothing wrong.|
037816|336-en|en|wav/p336_249.wav|||I don't have any regrets about the edit.|
037817|336-en|en|wav/p336_250.wav|||That does not mean we have failed.|
037818|336-en|en|wav/p336_251.wav|||The family baton is handed on.|
037819|336-en|en|wav/p336_252.wav|||She has a little boy.|
037820|336-en|en|wav/p336_253.wav|||Our policy is very clear on this issue.|
037821|336-en|en|wav/p336_254.wav|||He has refused to do that.|
037822|336-en|en|wav/p336_255.wav|||I can understand why they have gone.|
037823|336-en|en|wav/p336_256.wav|||All my training is for Athens.|
037824|336-en|en|wav/p336_257.wav|||This is a personal decision for me.|
037825|336-en|en|wav/p336_258.wav|||When will you listen?|
037826|336-en|en|wav/p336_259.wav|||I'm happy that we have agreed.|
037827|336-en|en|wav/p336_260.wav|||All of them were killed.|
037828|336-en|en|wav/p336_261.wav|||All the children on the roll are genuine.|
037829|336-en|en|wav/p336_262.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
037830|336-en|en|wav/p336_263.wav|||You can spend money on housing.|
037831|336-en|en|wav/p336_264.wav|||Ferguson must take the blame.|
037832|336-en|en|wav/p336_265.wav|||There is no point in denying that.|
037833|336-en|en|wav/p336_266.wav|||The kids are paying the price.|
037834|336-en|en|wav/p336_267.wav|||Not that it is unique.|
037835|336-en|en|wav/p336_268.wav|||We're all going to take a holiday.|
037836|336-en|en|wav/p336_269.wav|||I've got three other ideas for the day.|
037837|336-en|en|wav/p336_270.wav|||Some injustice was committed.|
037838|336-en|en|wav/p336_271.wav|||I've had a wonderful career.|
037839|336-en|en|wav/p336_272.wav|||The BBC was a disgrace.|
037840|336-en|en|wav/p336_273.wav|||I didn't expect to be in.|
037841|336-en|en|wav/p336_274.wav|||The Cabinet is split over the issue.|
037842|336-en|en|wav/p336_275.wav|||I reckon he won't make the mistake again.|
037843|336-en|en|wav/p336_276.wav|||I should think so, too.|
037844|336-en|en|wav/p336_277.wav|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
037845|336-en|en|wav/p336_278.wav|||It's not covered by the insurance.|
037846|336-en|en|wav/p336_279.wav|||He denied the charge.|
037847|336-en|en|wav/p336_280.wav|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
037848|336-en|en|wav/p336_281.wav|||There is no easy answer.|
037849|336-en|en|wav/p336_282.wav|||I watch the other visitors.|
037850|336-en|en|wav/p336_283.wav|||Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|
037851|336-en|en|wav/p336_284.wav|||I am not a liar.|
037852|336-en|en|wav/p336_285.wav|||The cause remained a mystery last night.|
037853|336-en|en|wav/p336_286.wav|||He had no problem with alcohol.|
037854|336-en|en|wav/p336_287.wav|||I had no experience at all.|
037855|336-en|en|wav/p336_288.wav|||Yet he remains confident enough.|
037856|336-en|en|wav/p336_289.wav|||It has become very confused.|
037857|336-en|en|wav/p336_290.wav|||Fame and money followed.|
037858|336-en|en|wav/p336_291.wav|||It's a national sport.|
037859|336-en|en|wav/p336_292.wav|||I just made it.|
037860|336-en|en|wav/p336_293.wav|||There was no secrecy.|
037861|336-en|en|wav/p336_294.wav|||A wide range of restrictions are in place.|
037862|336-en|en|wav/p336_295.wav|||Even then it might be difficult.|
037863|336-en|en|wav/p336_296.wav|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
037864|336-en|en|wav/p336_297.wav|||Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.|
037865|336-en|en|wav/p336_299.wav|||Relief was beyond belief.|
037866|336-en|en|wav/p336_300.wav|||Beyond that would have been outrageous.|
037867|336-en|en|wav/p336_301.wav|||It was complete nonsense.|
037868|336-en|en|wav/p336_302.wav|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
037869|336-en|en|wav/p336_303.wav|||It is three years.|
037870|336-en|en|wav/p336_304.wav|||They are not always the same person.|
037871|336-en|en|wav/p336_305.wav|||We meet again in Berlin.|
037872|336-en|en|wav/p336_306.wav|||This is a very special moment for me.|
037873|336-en|en|wav/p336_307.wav|||It is a daunting task.|
037874|336-en|en|wav/p336_308.wav|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
037875|336-en|en|wav/p336_309.wav|||We have chosen for the patients.|
037876|336-en|en|wav/p336_310.wav|||That was me today.|
037877|336-en|en|wav/p336_311.wav|||That is when we are really effective.|
037878|336-en|en|wav/p336_312.wav|||They just would not have run away.|
037879|336-en|en|wav/p336_313.wav|||But this isn't a play about The Troubles.|
037880|336-en|en|wav/p336_314.wav|||This idea has been around for four years.|
037881|336-en|en|wav/p336_315.wav|||But he made a mistake in picking it.|
037882|336-en|en|wav/p336_316.wav|||This is an appealing record.|
037883|336-en|en|wav/p336_317.wav|||They are a perfectly good thing in principle.|
037884|336-en|en|wav/p336_318.wav|||Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.|
037885|336-en|en|wav/p336_319.wav|||This is a problem we have to tackle.|
037886|336-en|en|wav/p336_320.wav|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
037887|336-en|en|wav/p336_321.wav|||Nobody should believe this story.|
037888|336-en|en|wav/p336_322.wav|||No person has been charged.|
037889|336-en|en|wav/p336_323.wav|||One paper was not returned.|
037890|336-en|en|wav/p336_324.wav|||I don't want to do too much.|
037891|336-en|en|wav/p336_325.wav|||We don't have money to get to town.|
037892|336-en|en|wav/p336_326.wav|||We have great support.|
037893|336-en|en|wav/p336_327.wav|||One would not want to go there anyway.|
037894|336-en|en|wav/p336_328.wav|||And it's difficult to argue.|
037895|336-en|en|wav/p336_329.wav|||We'll see what happens.|
037896|336-en|en|wav/p336_330.wav|||That could be in place by next year.|
037897|336-en|en|wav/p336_331.wav|||That's not part of the deal.|
037898|336-en|en|wav/p336_332.wav|||There is a problem.|
037899|336-en|en|wav/p336_333.wav|||He pretended not to care.|
037900|336-en|en|wav/p336_334.wav|||They are very concerned, and you can understand that.|
037901|336-en|en|wav/p336_335.wav|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
037902|336-en|en|wav/p336_336.wav|||Was it too obvious?|
037903|336-en|en|wav/p336_337.wav|||Wouldn't it be nice?|
037904|336-en|en|wav/p336_338.wav|||I was in tears in the street.|
037905|336-en|en|wav/p336_339.wav|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
037906|336-en|en|wav/p336_340.wav|||It is a terrible thing to have happened.|
037907|336-en|en|wav/p336_343.wav|||The work was suspended following the kidnap.|
037908|336-en|en|wav/p336_344.wav|||Fifteen minutes later, they were found.|
037909|336-en|en|wav/p336_345.wav|||That is why we are here.|
037910|336-en|en|wav/p336_346.wav|||He wouldn't do it.|
037911|336-en|en|wav/p336_347.wav|||She becomes a mother.|
037912|336-en|en|wav/p336_348.wav|||He is very much respected within the group.|
037913|336-en|en|wav/p336_349.wav|||People want to learn.|
037914|336-en|en|wav/p336_350.wav|||Bomber was not amused.|
037915|336-en|en|wav/p336_351.wav|||I am not a happy man.|
037916|336-en|en|wav/p336_352.wav|||But it was fun.|
037917|336-en|en|wav/p336_353.wav|||Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|
037918|336-en|en|wav/p336_354.wav|||No decisions have been made in this respect.|
037919|336-en|en|wav/p336_355.wav|||It's been such a waste of money.|
037920|336-en|en|wav/p336_356.wav|||Not so, it transpires.|
037921|336-en|en|wav/p336_357.wav|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
037922|336-en|en|wav/p336_358.wav|||Inside, there is a kind of madness.|
037923|336-en|en|wav/p336_359.wav|||I'd like to run.|
037924|336-en|en|wav/p336_360.wav|||Its future is no longer in question.|
037925|336-en|en|wav/p336_361.wav|||But this relative success has not been easy.|
037926|336-en|en|wav/p336_362.wav|||I am a player.|
037927|336-en|en|wav/p336_363.wav|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
037928|336-en|en|wav/p336_364.wav|||He was not alone.|
037929|336-en|en|wav/p336_365.wav|||There was too much at stake.|
037930|336-en|en|wav/p336_366.wav|||Who wouldn't do it?|
037931|336-en|en|wav/p336_368.wav|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
037932|336-en|en|wav/p336_369.wav|||Eriksson would have approved.|
037933|336-en|en|wav/p336_370.wav|||We are all in the frontline.|
037934|336-en|en|wav/p336_371.wav|||It looked like a war zone.|
037935|336-en|en|wav/p336_372.wav|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
037936|336-en|en|wav/p336_373.wav|||Further expansion is possible.|
037937|336-en|en|wav/p336_374.wav|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|
037938|336-en|en|wav/p336_375.wav|||I'm interested in all kinds of history.|
037939|336-en|en|wav/p336_376.wav|||At this point we can only speculate.|
037940|336-en|en|wav/p336_377.wav|||We know we have the quality.|
037941|336-en|en|wav/p336_378.wav|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
037942|336-en|en|wav/p336_379.wav|||It may be the first of many.|
037943|336-en|en|wav/p336_380.wav|||It runs in cycles.|
037944|336-en|en|wav/p336_381.wav|||It is already making a difference.|
037945|336-en|en|wav/p336_382.wav|||I spoke to him yesterday.|
037946|336-en|en|wav/p336_383.wav|||We are looking very hard at ourselves.|
037947|336-en|en|wav/p336_384.wav|||This is the stuff of live music.|
037948|336-en|en|wav/p336_385.wav|||We were beaten by the better team today.|
037949|336-en|en|wav/p336_386.wav|||Taxes may need to rise.|
037950|336-en|en|wav/p336_387.wav|||It's unusual to say the least.|
037951|336-en|en|wav/p336_388.wav|||I was quietly confident about getting the win.|
037952|336-en|en|wav/p336_389.wav|||I am not going to sit back.|
037953|336-en|en|wav/p336_390.wav|||But this is even worse.|
037954|336-en|en|wav/p336_391.wav|||It left me with a sadness.|
037955|336-en|en|wav/p336_392.wav|||I was living with my mum.|
037956|336-en|en|wav/p336_393.wav|||The truth is he probably doesn't.|
037957|336-en|en|wav/p336_394.wav|||There were few surprises.|
037958|336-en|en|wav/p336_395.wav|||He is a one-off.|
037959|336-en|en|wav/p336_396.wav|||And then he laughs.|
037960|336-en|en|wav/p336_397.wav|||She is having an affair with his partner.|
037961|336-en|en|wav/p336_398.wav|||He put a lot of effort into it.|
037962|336-en|en|wav/p336_399.wav|||The pressure is enormous.|
037963|336-en|en|wav/p336_400.wav|||I am not that sadistic.|
037964|336-en|en|wav/p336_401.wav|||Are you all right?|
037965|336-en|en|wav/p336_402.wav|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
037966|336-en|en|wav/p336_403.wav|||I'm certainly thinking about retirement.|
037967|336-en|en|wav/p336_404.wav|||But we say Yes - and we are the people.|
037968|336-en|en|wav/p336_405.wav|||Is it any good?|
037969|336-en|en|wav/p336_406.wav|||The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|
037970|336-en|en|wav/p336_407.wav|||It would be that absurd.|
037971|336-en|en|wav/p336_408.wav|||As if he would.|
037972|336-en|en|wav/p336_409.wav|||I just carry on with my work.|
037973|336-en|en|wav/p336_410.wav|||She made no further comment.|
037974|336-en|en|wav/p336_411.wav|||His attacker has been a Rangers fan.|
037975|336-en|en|wav/p336_412.wav|||He wants the festival to make a difference.|
037976|336-en|en|wav/p336_413.wav|||He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.|
037977|336-en|en|wav/p336_415.wav|||The auction has seven days to run.|
037978|336-en|en|wav/p336_416.wav|||It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|
037979|336-en|en|wav/p336_417.wav|||They want to prove a point.|
037980|336-en|en|wav/p336_418.wav|||It is my decision and my decision alone.|
037981|336-en|en|wav/p336_419.wav|||Would he ever go back to the beginning?|
037982|336-en|en|wav/p336_420.wav|||What is going on?|
037983|336-en|en|wav/p336_421.wav|||Let that be their memorial.|
037984|336-en|en|wav/p336_422.wav|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
037985|336-en|en|wav/p336_423.wav|||Tonight is very special.|
037986|336-en|en|wav/p336_424.wav|||This is a matter of life and death.|
037987|339-en|en|wav/p339_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
037988|339-en|en|wav/p339_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|

037992|339-en|en|wav/p339_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037993|339-en|en|wav/p339_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037994|339-en|en|wav/p339_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037995|339-en|en|wav/p339_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
037996|339-en|en|wav/p339_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037997|339-en|en|wav/p339_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037998|339-en|en|wav/p339_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037999|339-en|en|wav/p339_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038000|339-en|en|wav/p339_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038001|339-en|en|wav/p339_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038002|339-en|en|wav/p339_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038003|339-en|en|wav/p339_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038004|339-en|en|wav/p339_018.wav|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038005|339-en|en|wav/p339_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
038006|339-en|en|wav/p339_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038007|339-en|en|wav/p339_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038008|339-en|en|wav/p339_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038010|339-en|en|wav/p339_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038011|339-en|en|wav/p339_025.wav|||They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|
038012|339-en|en|wav/p339_026.wav|||The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.|

038016|339-en|en|wav/p339_030.wav|||It was really good in the first week.|
038017|339-en|en|wav/p339_031.wav|||It's about the balance.|
038018|339-en|en|wav/p339_032.wav|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
038019|339-en|en|wav/p339_033.wav|||It really has not been their season.|
038020|339-en|en|wav/p339_034.wav|||I want somebody with something to prove.|

038025|339-en|en|wav/p339_039.wav|||We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.|
038026|339-en|en|wav/p339_040.wav|||What will happen to them today?|
038027|339-en|en|wav/p339_041.wav|||I didn't expect to get one.|
038028|339-en|en|wav/p339_042.wav|||It was electric, amazing.|
038029|339-en|en|wav/p339_043.wav|||I said to him.|
038030|339-en|en|wav/p339_044.wav|||Labour has been found out on public spending.|
038031|339-en|en|wav/p339_045.wav|||he told a producer.|
038032|339-en|en|wav/p339_046.wav|||That is not the place for her.|
038033|339-en|en|wav/p339_047.wav|||The jury is still out on this one.|
038034|339-en|en|wav/p339_048.wav|||We have to work together.|
038035|339-en|en|wav/p339_049.wav|||I don't think that he won't be released.|
038036|339-en|en|wav/p339_050.wav|||It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|
038037|339-en|en|wav/p339_051.wav|||It means it is difficult.|
038038|339-en|en|wav/p339_052.wav|||But they were true stories.|
038039|339-en|en|wav/p339_053.wav|||I needed to get away.|
038040|339-en|en|wav/p339_054.wav|||I will make that point tonight.|
038041|339-en|en|wav/p339_055.wav|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|
038042|339-en|en|wav/p339_056.wav|||There are two things we have to do.|
038043|339-en|en|wav/p339_057.wav|||Are they going to work together again?|
038044|339-en|en|wav/p339_058.wav|||We need to do that every week.|
038045|339-en|en|wav/p339_059.wav|||It gives us something to work on.|
038046|339-en|en|wav/p339_060.wav|||But what did it matter?|
038047|339-en|en|wav/p339_061.wav|||A government is a government is a government.|
038048|339-en|en|wav/p339_062.wav|||Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.|
038049|339-en|en|wav/p339_063.wav|||I am not retaining him.|
038050|339-en|en|wav/p339_064.wav|||The police are not the target.|
038051|339-en|en|wav/p339_065.wav|||It has affected it, obviously.|
038052|339-en|en|wav/p339_066.wav|||But that title is a mistake.|
038053|339-en|en|wav/p339_067.wav|||And he's not a bigot.|
038054|339-en|en|wav/p339_068.wav|||But summer is spent.|
038055|339-en|en|wav/p339_069.wav|||Services are being expanded, too.|
038056|339-en|en|wav/p339_070.wav|||It has only been rumours.|
038057|339-en|en|wav/p339_071.wav|||It is extremely fortunate.|
038058|339-en|en|wav/p339_072.wav|||Today is the first step in that process.|
038059|339-en|en|wav/p339_073.wav|||Several others were absent.|
038060|339-en|en|wav/p339_074.wav|||It is surprising to come back this way.|
038061|339-en|en|wav/p339_075.wav|||But there was no time for that.|
038062|339-en|en|wav/p339_076.wav|||A review is under way.|
038063|339-en|en|wav/p339_077.wav|||That should be fun.|
038064|339-en|en|wav/p339_078.wav|||Maybe he will act again.|
038065|339-en|en|wav/p339_079.wav|||What we were doing.|
038066|339-en|en|wav/p339_080.wav|||What is the Barnett formula?|
038067|339-en|en|wav/p339_081.wav|||It all happened so suddenly.|
038068|339-en|en|wav/p339_082.wav|||I won't let that happen.|
038069|339-en|en|wav/p339_083.wav|||Or have they?|
038070|339-en|en|wav/p339_084.wav|||There is no change in the strategy.|
038071|339-en|en|wav/p339_085.wav|||I had a fortunate war.|
038072|339-en|en|wav/p339_086.wav|||It will probably be my last, too.|
038073|339-en|en|wav/p339_087.wav|||I am not completely insane.|
038074|339-en|en|wav/p339_088.wav|||We spoke about a few people.|
038075|339-en|en|wav/p339_089.wav|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
038076|339-en|en|wav/p339_090.wav|||In fact, he took it very well.|
038077|339-en|en|wav/p339_091.wav|||I decided to take my time.|
038078|339-en|en|wav/p339_092.wav|||Quite a lot of people know that, actually.|
038079|339-en|en|wav/p339_093.wav|||We did it in one take.|
038080|339-en|en|wav/p339_094.wav|||He doesn't even know who he is.|
038081|339-en|en|wav/p339_095.wav|||It is hard to understand.|
038082|339-en|en|wav/p339_096.wav|||What will it be?|
038083|339-en|en|wav/p339_097.wav|||The search is due to be completed today.|
038084|339-en|en|wav/p339_098.wav|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
038085|339-en|en|wav/p339_099.wav|||What you sow, you have to reap.|
038086|339-en|en|wav/p339_100.wav|||He is a one-off.|
038087|339-en|en|wav/p339_101.wav|||Six men will take the decision.|
038088|339-en|en|wav/p339_102.wav|||To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.|
038089|339-en|en|wav/p339_103.wav|||We should not be surprised at that.|
038090|339-en|en|wav/p339_104.wav|||It was a disaster.|
038091|339-en|en|wav/p339_105.wav|||We have been so lucky.|
038092|339-en|en|wav/p339_107.wav|||It was a bit of a tightrope.|
038093|339-en|en|wav/p339_108.wav|||I don't know what we're doing wrong.|
038094|339-en|en|wav/p339_109.wav|||It was all over now.|
038095|339-en|en|wav/p339_110.wav|||But it was only a matter of time.|
038096|339-en|en|wav/p339_111.wav|||I always liked to get a laugh.|
038097|339-en|en|wav/p339_112.wav|||I still hope to go.|
038098|339-en|en|wav/p339_113.wav|||Sometimes they come off.|
038099|339-en|en|wav/p339_114.wav|||We're not that bad.|
038100|339-en|en|wav/p339_115.wav|||Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.|
038101|339-en|en|wav/p339_116.wav|||I feel strongly about it.|
038102|339-en|en|wav/p339_117.wav|||There are exciting days ahead.|
038103|339-en|en|wav/p339_118.wav|||We have to put this behind us.|
038104|339-en|en|wav/p339_119.wav|||I thought it was quite good.|
038105|339-en|en|wav/p339_120.wav|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
038106|339-en|en|wav/p339_121.wav|||We're very, very happy.|
038107|339-en|en|wav/p339_122.wav|||There could be a possible connection.|
038108|339-en|en|wav/p339_123.wav|||But there was everything!|
038109|339-en|en|wav/p339_124.wav|||We are doing very well as we are.|
038110|339-en|en|wav/p339_125.wav|||The Scots are great.|
038111|339-en|en|wav/p339_126.wav|||That imbalance was evident in their play.|
038112|339-en|en|wav/p339_127.wav|||However, the drama was not over.|
038113|339-en|en|wav/p339_128.wav|||But it was not just the land.|
038114|339-en|en|wav/p339_129.wav|||I don't think the referees are against us.|
038115|339-en|en|wav/p339_130.wav|||It is too much for me.|
038116|339-en|en|wav/p339_131.wav|||It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|
038117|339-en|en|wav/p339_132.wav|||We are still waiting.|
038118|339-en|en|wav/p339_133.wav|||It happened again yesterday.|
038119|339-en|en|wav/p339_134.wav|||He will be a major challenger next year.|
038120|339-en|en|wav/p339_135.wav|||That question was never asked.|
038121|339-en|en|wav/p339_136.wav|||I am not inclined to believe it.|
038122|339-en|en|wav/p339_137.wav|||It was on fire.|
038123|339-en|en|wav/p339_138.wav|||I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|
038124|339-en|en|wav/p339_139.wav|||How can they tell?|
038125|339-en|en|wav/p339_140.wav|||My ambition is to make the cut.|
038126|339-en|en|wav/p339_141.wav|||It will be for the committee to decide.|
038127|339-en|en|wav/p339_142.wav|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
038128|339-en|en|wav/p339_143.wav|||Rangers must be winners, it says.|
038129|339-en|en|wav/p339_144.wav|||He was part of the family.|
038130|339-en|en|wav/p339_145.wav|||I certainly think it should be there.|
038131|339-en|en|wav/p339_146.wav|||But it does not matter.|
038132|339-en|en|wav/p339_147.wav|||Hopefully we can put in a performance.|
038133|339-en|en|wav/p339_148.wav|||Sadly, he has a point.|
038134|339-en|en|wav/p339_149.wav|||It was so sad.|
038135|339-en|en|wav/p339_150.wav|||Mind you, all was not lost.|
038136|339-en|en|wav/p339_151.wav|||We were extremely lucky.|
038137|339-en|en|wav/p339_152.wav|||It was an amazing time.|
038138|339-en|en|wav/p339_153.wav|||In fact, the reasons are simple.|
038139|339-en|en|wav/p339_154.wav|||The hearing is expected to continue today.|
038140|339-en|en|wav/p339_155.wav|||It is just a matter of time.|
038141|339-en|en|wav/p339_156.wav|||This news is really depressing.|
038142|339-en|en|wav/p339_157.wav|||I'm not fit for anything else.|
038143|339-en|en|wav/p339_158.wav|||The day may come, but not for a while.|
038144|339-en|en|wav/p339_159.wav|||The enemy was time.|
038145|339-en|en|wav/p339_160.wav|||He would have done the same to me.|
038146|339-en|en|wav/p339_161.wav|||What were they told?|
038147|339-en|en|wav/p339_162.wav|||More cases are expected.|
038148|339-en|en|wav/p339_163.wav|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
038149|339-en|en|wav/p339_164.wav|||It would be very dangerous.|
038150|339-en|en|wav/p339_165.wav|||How can they say that?|
038151|339-en|en|wav/p339_166.wav|||My condition is not bad.|
038152|339-en|en|wav/p339_167.wav|||Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.|
038153|339-en|en|wav/p339_168.wav|||I would like to make an impact, of course.|
038154|339-en|en|wav/p339_169.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
038155|339-en|en|wav/p339_170.wav|||The goal is clear.|
038156|339-en|en|wav/p339_171.wav|||Just think about the lines.|
038157|339-en|en|wav/p339_172.wav|||It all depends on the wind.|
038158|339-en|en|wav/p339_173.wav|||I was very influenced by him.|
038159|339-en|en|wav/p339_174.wav|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
038160|339-en|en|wav/p339_175.wav|||This was much worse.|
038161|339-en|en|wav/p339_176.wav|||This was certainly not about money.|
038162|339-en|en|wav/p339_177.wav|||It is simple, but profound.|
038163|339-en|en|wav/p339_178.wav|||The funding is now there.|
038164|339-en|en|wav/p339_179.wav|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
038165|339-en|en|wav/p339_180.wav|||A film is different from a book.|
038166|339-en|en|wav/p339_181.wav|||Within three days he was dead.|
038167|339-en|en|wav/p339_182.wav|||You'll find out on Saturday.|
038168|339-en|en|wav/p339_183.wav|||Did they give any good advice?|
038169|339-en|en|wav/p339_184.wav|||We know that from recent experience.|
038170|339-en|en|wav/p339_185.wav|||From day one, we were a family.|
038171|339-en|en|wav/p339_186.wav|||It separates the men from the boys.|
038172|339-en|en|wav/p339_187.wav|||This could be wonderful.|
038173|339-en|en|wav/p339_188.wav|||He loved it, and so did they.|
038174|339-en|en|wav/p339_189.wav|||The other was a football match.|
038175|339-en|en|wav/p339_190.wav|||They have the players to do it.|
038176|339-en|en|wav/p339_191.wav|||Which is worse?|
038177|339-en|en|wav/p339_192.wav|||He has made a step forward.|
038178|339-en|en|wav/p339_193.wav|||That was very important.|
038179|339-en|en|wav/p339_194.wav|||This will have to change.|
038180|339-en|en|wav/p339_195.wav|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
038181|339-en|en|wav/p339_196.wav|||It was a very strong metaphor.|
038182|339-en|en|wav/p339_197.wav|||We are going to have a party.|
038183|339-en|en|wav/p339_198.wav|||I have no problem with that.|
038184|339-en|en|wav/p339_199.wav|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
038185|339-en|en|wav/p339_200.wav|||I'm very happy that it exploded.|
038186|339-en|en|wav/p339_201.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
038187|339-en|en|wav/p339_202.wav|||Lester was like that.|
038188|339-en|en|wav/p339_203.wav|||Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.|
038189|339-en|en|wav/p339_204.wav|||That's a matter for them.|
038190|339-en|en|wav/p339_205.wav|||We were never told it was already decided.|
038191|339-en|en|wav/p339_206.wav|||It is part of our heritage.|
038192|339-en|en|wav/p339_207.wav|||It is not a road of life.|
038193|339-en|en|wav/p339_208.wav|||It is not as simple as that.|
038194|339-en|en|wav/p339_209.wav|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
038195|339-en|en|wav/p339_210.wav|||Find them somebody they deserve.|
038196|339-en|en|wav/p339_211.wav|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
038197|339-en|en|wav/p339_212.wav|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
038198|339-en|en|wav/p339_213.wav|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
038199|339-en|en|wav/p339_214.wav|||We're not getting involved.|
038200|339-en|en|wav/p339_215.wav|||The lottery has helped.|
038201|339-en|en|wav/p339_216.wav|||They know the language.|
038202|339-en|en|wav/p339_217.wav|||The acting left a lot to be desired.|
038203|339-en|en|wav/p339_218.wav|||We shall be victorious.|
038204|339-en|en|wav/p339_219.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
038205|339-en|en|wav/p339_220.wav|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
038206|339-en|en|wav/p339_221.wav|||You cannot do that in a lobby.|
038207|339-en|en|wav/p339_222.wav|||We will all suffer as a result.|
038208|339-en|en|wav/p339_223.wav|||Without doubt, they can win the title.|
038209|339-en|en|wav/p339_224.wav|||What's it about?|
038210|339-en|en|wav/p339_225.wav|||We are looking to the future.|
038211|339-en|en|wav/p339_226.wav|||The signs are positive.|
038212|339-en|en|wav/p339_227.wav|||I called it right.|
038213|339-en|en|wav/p339_228.wav|||I see it as my job.|
038214|339-en|en|wav/p339_229.wav|||I have always believed in myself.|
038215|339-en|en|wav/p339_230.wav|||It has to be put in context.|
038216|339-en|en|wav/p339_231.wav|||I think we can get there.|
038217|339-en|en|wav/p339_232.wav|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
038218|339-en|en|wav/p339_233.wav|||No, they have played well.|
038219|339-en|en|wav/p339_234.wav|||The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|
038220|339-en|en|wav/p339_235.wav|||The answer is obviously no.|
038221|339-en|en|wav/p339_236.wav|||I'll take it as it comes.|
038222|339-en|en|wav/p339_237.wav|||I think we're the better side.|
038223|339-en|en|wav/p339_238.wav|||We act because we must.|
038224|339-en|en|wav/p339_239.wav|||There are two mysteries.|
038225|339-en|en|wav/p339_240.wav|||The teacher would have approved.|
038226|339-en|en|wav/p339_241.wav|||Are you going to win?|
038227|339-en|en|wav/p339_242.wav|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
038228|339-en|en|wav/p339_243.wav|||I could have been killed on that day.|
038229|339-en|en|wav/p339_244.wav|||They have to come up with a solution.|
038230|339-en|en|wav/p339_245.wav|||It is very enjoyable.|
038231|339-en|en|wav/p339_246.wav|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
038232|339-en|en|wav/p339_247.wav|||Did it work?|
038233|339-en|en|wav/p339_248.wav|||But that is for another day.|
038234|339-en|en|wav/p339_249.wav|||There is a great carry over value.|
038235|339-en|en|wav/p339_250.wav|||It was not like that at all.|
038236|339-en|en|wav/p339_251.wav|||Police are appealing for witnesses.|
038237|339-en|en|wav/p339_252.wav|||I was very surprised.|
038238|339-en|en|wav/p339_253.wav|||We all knew they could do it.|
038239|339-en|en|wav/p339_254.wav|||It's about taking risks.|
038240|339-en|en|wav/p339_255.wav|||Why is this?|
038241|339-en|en|wav/p339_256.wav|||He is due in Israel tomorrow.|
038242|339-en|en|wav/p339_257.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
038243|339-en|en|wav/p339_258.wav|||There are not too many like him.|
038244|339-en|en|wav/p339_259.wav|||The memory is there.|
038245|339-en|en|wav/p339_260.wav|||It was an amazing experience.|
038246|339-en|en|wav/p339_261.wav|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
038247|339-en|en|wav/p339_262.wav|||He will go on the bench.|
038248|339-en|en|wav/p339_263.wav|||The police are hopeless.|
038249|339-en|en|wav/p339_264.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
038250|339-en|en|wav/p339_265.wav|||We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|
038251|339-en|en|wav/p339_266.wav|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
038252|339-en|en|wav/p339_267.wav|||That's the important thing.|
038253|339-en|en|wav/p339_268.wav|||Should he resign?|
038254|339-en|en|wav/p339_269.wav|||They have to live with the risk.|
038255|339-en|en|wav/p339_270.wav|||It is, but that's not the point.|
038256|339-en|en|wav/p339_271.wav|||It was my whole life.|
038257|339-en|en|wav/p339_272.wav|||It was a classic.|
038258|339-en|en|wav/p339_273.wav|||This week is a perfect example.|
038259|339-en|en|wav/p339_274.wav|||However, it is going to happen.|
038260|339-en|en|wav/p339_275.wav|||This time it really could happen.|
038261|339-en|en|wav/p339_276.wav|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
038262|339-en|en|wav/p339_277.wav|||That includes the equipment?|
038263|339-en|en|wav/p339_278.wav|||It does nothing for me.|
038264|339-en|en|wav/p339_279.wav|||That has been lost.|
038265|339-en|en|wav/p339_280.wav|||But that's another story.|
038266|339-en|en|wav/p339_281.wav|||I think it has worked.|
038267|339-en|en|wav/p339_282.wav|||No other family members could be contacted.|
038268|339-en|en|wav/p339_283.wav|||There is nothing to be gained from that.|
038269|339-en|en|wav/p339_284.wav|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
038270|339-en|en|wav/p339_285.wav|||But do not rely on it.|
038271|339-en|en|wav/p339_286.wav|||I made a mistake.|
038272|339-en|en|wav/p339_287.wav|||What do you want.|
038273|339-en|en|wav/p339_288.wav|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
038274|339-en|en|wav/p339_289.wav|||I think we could do well in Europe.|
038275|339-en|en|wav/p339_290.wav|||And yet, there has been no great impact.|
038276|339-en|en|wav/p339_291.wav|||Was that not awful?|
038277|339-en|en|wav/p339_292.wav|||Yesterday was a statement of intent.|
038278|339-en|en|wav/p339_293.wav|||I'm not there yet but it is close.|
038279|339-en|en|wav/p339_294.wav|||But it will not work again.|
038280|339-en|en|wav/p339_295.wav|||Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|
038281|339-en|en|wav/p339_296.wav|||I have nothing to say on that.|
038282|339-en|en|wav/p339_297.wav|||The rest is his own.|
038283|339-en|en|wav/p339_298.wav|||I have no worry about that.|
038284|339-en|en|wav/p339_299.wav|||There has been a fair bit in between, too.|
038285|339-en|en|wav/p339_300.wav|||Who was on the panel?|
038286|339-en|en|wav/p339_301.wav|||It turned out to have been three hours.|
038287|339-en|en|wav/p339_302.wav|||That is exactly right.|
038288|339-en|en|wav/p339_303.wav|||That is not good for golf!|
038289|339-en|en|wav/p339_304.wav|||He had planned to sell it.|
038290|339-en|en|wav/p339_305.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
038291|339-en|en|wav/p339_306.wav|||But it did not last.|
038292|339-en|en|wav/p339_307.wav|||They need to look after themselves.|
038293|339-en|en|wav/p339_308.wav|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
038294|339-en|en|wav/p339_309.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
038295|339-en|en|wav/p339_310.wav|||We have nothing to lose.|
038296|339-en|en|wav/p339_311.wav|||The first time it was rejected.|
038297|339-en|en|wav/p339_312.wav|||He did not report it.|
038298|339-en|en|wav/p339_313.wav|||No-one can take it in.|
038299|339-en|en|wav/p339_314.wav|||They were following his orders.|
038300|339-en|en|wav/p339_315.wav|||That is an entirely different discipline.|
038301|339-en|en|wav/p339_316.wav|||It was an insult.|
038302|339-en|en|wav/p339_317.wav|||Yet there is hope.|
038303|339-en|en|wav/p339_318.wav|||Referees in Scotland are very weak.|
038304|339-en|en|wav/p339_319.wav|||It will not be easy for him.|
038305|339-en|en|wav/p339_320.wav|||That was a fairy tale.|
038306|339-en|en|wav/p339_321.wav|||I would love to do that.|
038307|339-en|en|wav/p339_322.wav|||You'll have to wait and see.|
038308|339-en|en|wav/p339_323.wav|||It wasn't the issue.|
038309|339-en|en|wav/p339_324.wav|||The number never came.|
038310|339-en|en|wav/p339_325.wav|||I really have to go now.|
038311|339-en|en|wav/p339_326.wav|||We are going to listen to Britain.|
038312|339-en|en|wav/p339_327.wav|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
038313|339-en|en|wav/p339_328.wav|||Words are not enough.|
038314|339-en|en|wav/p339_329.wav|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
038315|339-en|en|wav/p339_330.wav|||We have expected it.|
038316|339-en|en|wav/p339_331.wav|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
038317|339-en|en|wav/p339_332.wav|||Well, that was the plan.|
038318|339-en|en|wav/p339_333.wav|||The problem is fairly serious.|
038319|339-en|en|wav/p339_334.wav|||No decisions have been taken.|
038320|339-en|en|wav/p339_335.wav|||We won't do that.|
038321|339-en|en|wav/p339_336.wav|||It's the body that counts.|
038322|339-en|en|wav/p339_337.wav|||Sprinters are not fit.|
038323|339-en|en|wav/p339_338.wav|||This has been coming for weeks and weeks.|
038324|339-en|en|wav/p339_339.wav|||It's a double whammy.|
038325|339-en|en|wav/p339_340.wav|||Charges against the pair were found not proven.|
038326|339-en|en|wav/p339_341.wav|||Let's not make that mistake again.|
038327|339-en|en|wav/p339_342.wav|||That's why he is the prime minister.|
038328|339-en|en|wav/p339_343.wav|||Only injury has prevented that happening before.|
038329|339-en|en|wav/p339_344.wav|||They have to be dealt with.|
038330|339-en|en|wav/p339_345.wav|||His manager blamed the referee.|
038331|339-en|en|wav/p339_346.wav|||So what was he really doing?|
038332|339-en|en|wav/p339_347.wav|||I don't want to go anywhere.|
038333|339-en|en|wav/p339_348.wav|||How do we get a bigger stage?|
038334|339-en|en|wav/p339_349.wav|||We're very close to being a good team.|
038335|339-en|en|wav/p339_350.wav|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
038336|339-en|en|wav/p339_351.wav|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
038337|339-en|en|wav/p339_352.wav|||My mind is the most important thing now.|
038338|339-en|en|wav/p339_353.wav|||I had nothing to lose.|
038339|339-en|en|wav/p339_354.wav|||This is a really serious issue.|
038340|339-en|en|wav/p339_355.wav|||I thought to myself.|
038341|339-en|en|wav/p339_356.wav|||Could it be?|
038342|339-en|en|wav/p339_357.wav|||We're talking to the US.|
038343|339-en|en|wav/p339_358.wav|||Thereafter they were again in control.|
038344|339-en|en|wav/p339_359.wav|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
038345|339-en|en|wav/p339_360.wav|||You have to keep the focus alive.|
038346|339-en|en|wav/p339_361.wav|||It could have been a ceilidh.|
038347|339-en|en|wav/p339_362.wav|||I cannot really commit.|
038348|339-en|en|wav/p339_363.wav|||There are many questions to be answered.|
038349|339-en|en|wav/p339_364.wav|||Sadly, so did a couple of errors.|
038350|339-en|en|wav/p339_365.wav|||This is a new beginning.|
038351|339-en|en|wav/p339_366.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
038352|339-en|en|wav/p339_367.wav|||They will fight for everything.|
038353|339-en|en|wav/p339_368.wav|||He is doing just that.|
038354|339-en|en|wav/p339_369.wav|||The night is young.|
038355|339-en|en|wav/p339_370.wav|||But there are signs of a revival.|
038356|339-en|en|wav/p339_371.wav|||I thought it was a great game.|
038357|339-en|en|wav/p339_372.wav|||Just get on with it.|
038358|339-en|en|wav/p339_373.wav|||Germany also said it was unimpressed.|
038359|339-en|en|wav/p339_374.wav|||It shows the Government is listening.|
038360|339-en|en|wav/p339_375.wav|||She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|
038361|339-en|en|wav/p339_376.wav|||They want it to work.|
038362|339-en|en|wav/p339_377.wav|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
038363|339-en|en|wav/p339_378.wav|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
038364|339-en|en|wav/p339_379.wav|||It decided to blame the media.|
038365|339-en|en|wav/p339_380.wav|||We have chosen for the patients.|
038366|339-en|en|wav/p339_381.wav|||He was at the outset of his career.|
038367|339-en|en|wav/p339_382.wav|||Our position is quite clear.|
038368|339-en|en|wav/p339_383.wav|||It could now be up to the courts.|
038369|339-en|en|wav/p339_384.wav|||We can make a difference.|
038370|339-en|en|wav/p339_385.wav|||This was not a contest.|
038371|339-en|en|wav/p339_386.wav|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038372|339-en|en|wav/p339_387.wav|||Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|
038373|339-en|en|wav/p339_388.wav|||I cannot describe it.|
038374|339-en|en|wav/p339_389.wav|||It is not designed to kill.|
038375|339-en|en|wav/p339_390.wav|||He has run a hell of a race.|
038376|339-en|en|wav/p339_391.wav|||We'll have to be satisfied with it.|
038377|339-en|en|wav/p339_392.wav|||Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.|
038378|339-en|en|wav/p339_393.wav|||It is good football in Scotland.|
038379|339-en|en|wav/p339_394.wav|||There is no other option.|
038380|339-en|en|wav/p339_395.wav|||You can feel the tension in the air.|
038381|339-en|en|wav/p339_396.wav|||It is a technique.|
038382|339-en|en|wav/p339_397.wav|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
038383|339-en|en|wav/p339_398.wav|||My body is exhausted.|
038384|339-en|en|wav/p339_399.wav|||It is about more than Scotland.|
038385|339-en|en|wav/p339_400.wav|||It's not just going to be busy.|
038386|339-en|en|wav/p339_401.wav|||She was on the edge of breaking point.|
038387|339-en|en|wav/p339_402.wav|||The first appeared to be successful.|
038388|339-en|en|wav/p339_403.wav|||She was so supportive.|
038389|339-en|en|wav/p339_404.wav|||I'm delighted with our performance.|
038390|339-en|en|wav/p339_405.wav|||We await a decision.|
038391|339-en|en|wav/p339_406.wav|||It's a matter of balance.|
038392|339-en|en|wav/p339_407.wav|||It is an investment in our product.|
038393|339-en|en|wav/p339_408.wav|||Everyone can have their opinion.|
038394|339-en|en|wav/p339_409.wav|||What would you ask?|
038395|339-en|en|wav/p339_410.wav|||We have got to deal with it.|
038396|339-en|en|wav/p339_411.wav|||Where do we spend it?|
038397|339-en|en|wav/p339_412.wav|||I don't know how she does it.|
038398|339-en|en|wav/p339_413.wav|||I saw it later in the news.|
038399|339-en|en|wav/p339_414.wav|||Now we must look to the future.|
038400|339-en|en|wav/p339_415.wav|||I didn't play badly.|
038401|339-en|en|wav/p339_416.wav|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
038402|339-en|en|wav/p339_417.wav|||They are looking for partners.|
038403|339-en|en|wav/p339_418.wav|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
038404|339-en|en|wav/p339_419.wav|||We should have been rewarded for producing.|
038405|339-en|en|wav/p339_420.wav|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
038406|339-en|en|wav/p339_421.wav|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
038407|339-en|en|wav/p339_422.wav|||There is no shortage of questions.|
038408|339-en|en|wav/p339_423.wav|||Couldn't see the point.|
038409|339-en|en|wav/p339_424.wav|||Which, in effect, it is.|
038410|340-en|en|wav/p340_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
038411|340-en|en|wav/p340_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
038412|340-en|en|wav/p340_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
038413|340-en|en|wav/p340_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
038414|340-en|en|wav/p340_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
038415|340-en|en|wav/p340_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
038416|340-en|en|wav/p340_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038417|340-en|en|wav/p340_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038418|340-en|en|wav/p340_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038419|340-en|en|wav/p340_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038420|340-en|en|wav/p340_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038421|340-en|en|wav/p340_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038422|340-en|en|wav/p340_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038423|340-en|en|wav/p340_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038424|340-en|en|wav/p340_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038425|340-en|en|wav/p340_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038426|340-en|en|wav/p340_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.|
038427|340-en|en|wav/p340_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038428|340-en|en|wav/p340_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
038429|340-en|en|wav/p340_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038430|340-en|en|wav/p340_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038431|340-en|en|wav/p340_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038432|340-en|en|wav/p340_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038433|340-en|en|wav/p340_025.wav|||It would be nice.|
038434|340-en|en|wav/p340_026.wav|||We are not prepared to do that.|
038435|340-en|en|wav/p340_027.wav|||We've just decided to do something about it.|
038436|340-en|en|wav/p340_028.wav|||It's a horrific incident.|
038437|340-en|en|wav/p340_029.wav|||But it's not just about that.|
038438|340-en|en|wav/p340_030.wav|||We've not won anything yet.|
038439|340-en|en|wav/p340_031.wav|||He was very close.|
038440|340-en|en|wav/p340_032.wav|||But someone has to take them.|
038441|340-en|en|wav/p340_033.wav|||We don't find any danger from them.|
038442|340-en|en|wav/p340_034.wav|||Do you think they would do any better?|
038443|340-en|en|wav/p340_035.wav|||They were appalling, disgraceful.|
038444|340-en|en|wav/p340_036.wav|||Who was that?|
038445|340-en|en|wav/p340_037.wav|||There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|
038446|340-en|en|wav/p340_038.wav|||This is my personal assessment.|
038447|340-en|en|wav/p340_039.wav|||It is a recipe for success.|
038448|340-en|en|wav/p340_040.wav|||You've got to have everything inside with you.|
038449|340-en|en|wav/p340_041.wav|||We didn't deserve to win.|
038450|340-en|en|wav/p340_042.wav|||This is great news.|
038451|340-en|en|wav/p340_043.wav|||We can hardly talk about it.|
038452|340-en|en|wav/p340_044.wav|||That was a month ago.|
038453|340-en|en|wav/p340_045.wav|||I have lost all confidence.|
038454|340-en|en|wav/p340_046.wav|||It would be another reason to live.|
038455|340-en|en|wav/p340_047.wav|||I felt under a lot of pressure.|
038456|340-en|en|wav/p340_048.wav|||None of the pieces was commissioned.|
038457|340-en|en|wav/p340_049.wav|||It is somewhere to be.|
038458|340-en|en|wav/p340_050.wav|||But it was no problem.|
038459|340-en|en|wav/p340_051.wav|||This has been a difficult time for me.|
038460|340-en|en|wav/p340_052.wav|||These people are not big names.|
038461|340-en|en|wav/p340_053.wav|||Don't you believe it.|
038462|340-en|en|wav/p340_054.wav|||I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|
038463|340-en|en|wav/p340_055.wav|||We did something about it.|
038464|340-en|en|wav/p340_056.wav|||Where is the money coming from?|
038465|340-en|en|wav/p340_057.wav|||It needs a rethink.|
038466|340-en|en|wav/p340_058.wav|||Why does it work?|
038467|340-en|en|wav/p340_059.wav|||He would have been wrong.|
038468|340-en|en|wav/p340_060.wav|||He played really, really well.|
038469|340-en|en|wav/p340_061.wav|||He was right of course.|
038470|340-en|en|wav/p340_062.wav|||It's there for people to look at.|
038471|340-en|en|wav/p340_063.wav|||Together, we can make a difference.|
038472|340-en|en|wav/p340_064.wav|||That, however, was the exception.|
038473|340-en|en|wav/p340_065.wav|||This has been a long process.|
038474|340-en|en|wav/p340_066.wav|||It's a lovely, lovely film.|
038475|340-en|en|wav/p340_067.wav|||It's probably just as well.|
038476|340-en|en|wav/p340_068.wav|||It is time for the talking to stop.|
038477|340-en|en|wav/p340_069.wav|||We were very close.|
038478|340-en|en|wav/p340_070.wav|||If only it were so.|
038479|340-en|en|wav/p340_071.wav|||They do not deliver.|
038480|340-en|en|wav/p340_072.wav|||However, that is just for starters.|
038481|340-en|en|wav/p340_073.wav|||This can be extreme.|
038482|340-en|en|wav/p340_074.wav|||I'm sure that they will learn.|
038483|340-en|en|wav/p340_075.wav|||Would she remember the music?|
038484|340-en|en|wav/p340_076.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
038485|340-en|en|wav/p340_077.wav|||Two options are being proposed.|
038486|340-en|en|wav/p340_078.wav|||Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.|
038487|340-en|en|wav/p340_079.wav|||He is now back in Britain.|
038488|340-en|en|wav/p340_080.wav|||There was no commission.|
038489|340-en|en|wav/p340_081.wav|||There was a vacuum.|
038490|340-en|en|wav/p340_082.wav|||It is time to be realistic.|
038491|340-en|en|wav/p340_083.wav|||Everyone in front of me was dead.|
038492|340-en|en|wav/p340_084.wav|||Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|
038493|340-en|en|wav/p340_085.wav|||It is a potential danger.|
038494|340-en|en|wav/p340_086.wav|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
038495|340-en|en|wav/p340_087.wav|||But we never wanted to do that here.|
038496|340-en|en|wav/p340_088.wav|||There was no hint of scandal.|
038497|340-en|en|wav/p340_089.wav|||The money will go straight to the headteacher.|
038498|340-en|en|wav/p340_090.wav|||He said, we're delighted by the vote.|
038499|340-en|en|wav/p340_091.wav|||It could be to do with the location.|
038500|340-en|en|wav/p340_092.wav|||This is a terrible tragedy.|
038501|340-en|en|wav/p340_093.wav|||The teenager had been missing for six months.|
038502|340-en|en|wav/p340_094.wav|||I'm delighted to be coming back home.|
038503|340-en|en|wav/p340_095.wav|||He said he never saw it.|
038504|340-en|en|wav/p340_096.wav|||It is a matter of clarity.|
038505|340-en|en|wav/p340_097.wav|||You will never get a conviction.|
038506|340-en|en|wav/p340_098.wav|||He did not have to stop and think.|
038507|340-en|en|wav/p340_099.wav|||We deserved to win it.|
038508|340-en|en|wav/p340_100.wav|||Or did it?|
038509|340-en|en|wav/p340_101.wav|||It's just not funny!|
038510|340-en|en|wav/p340_102.wav|||His own excitement is never difficult to detect.|
038511|340-en|en|wav/p340_103.wav|||He almost admitted as much.|
038512|340-en|en|wav/p340_104.wav|||So what is the problem?|
038513|340-en|en|wav/p340_105.wav|||We believe it to be completely without merit.|
038514|340-en|en|wav/p340_106.wav|||He didn't bother a soul.|
038515|340-en|en|wav/p340_107.wav|||That was my first reaction.|
038516|340-en|en|wav/p340_108.wav|||Fishing is a declining industry.|
038517|340-en|en|wav/p340_109.wav|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
038518|340-en|en|wav/p340_110.wav|||That's the way it goes.|
038519|340-en|en|wav/p340_111.wav|||But we still don't know.|
038520|340-en|en|wav/p340_112.wav|||Are there any he wants to play?|
038521|340-en|en|wav/p340_113.wav|||The film is on a tightrope.|
038522|340-en|en|wav/p340_114.wav|||It was a question of patience.|
038523|340-en|en|wav/p340_115.wav|||I have never been in anything like that.|
038524|340-en|en|wav/p340_116.wav|||I have done ever since it was published.|
038525|340-en|en|wav/p340_117.wav|||We have got to the top.|
038526|340-en|en|wav/p340_118.wav|||In fact, they have the opposite effect.|
038527|340-en|en|wav/p340_119.wav|||And it worked, so we kept it.|
038528|340-en|en|wav/p340_120.wav|||The king is delighted by the honour.|
038529|340-en|en|wav/p340_121.wav|||Johnsen is equally concerned.|
038530|340-en|en|wav/p340_122.wav|||My body is clearly capable.|
038531|340-en|en|wav/p340_123.wav|||Yes, we can beat them.|
038532|340-en|en|wav/p340_124.wav|||She was not hard done by.|
038533|340-en|en|wav/p340_125.wav|||They said they were only young men.|
038534|340-en|en|wav/p340_126.wav|||We are in the end game.|
038535|340-en|en|wav/p340_127.wav|||This is not the case.|
038536|340-en|en|wav/p340_128.wav|||There may be some resistance.|
038537|340-en|en|wav/p340_129.wav|||It is the same old story.|
038538|340-en|en|wav/p340_130.wav|||You need that freedom in society.|
038539|340-en|en|wav/p340_131.wav|||It is a strong case.|
038540|340-en|en|wav/p340_132.wav|||Who do you think will win?|
038541|340-en|en|wav/p340_133.wav|||I certainly would not accept this decision.|
038542|340-en|en|wav/p340_134.wav|||That was one very hard game.|
038543|340-en|en|wav/p340_135.wav|||He said something in his work.|
038544|340-en|en|wav/p340_136.wav|||I recommend a tour.|
038545|340-en|en|wav/p340_137.wav|||This research is extremely promising.|
038546|340-en|en|wav/p340_138.wav|||I was invited to work in Germany.|
038547|340-en|en|wav/p340_139.wav|||Weather conditions were good, he added.|
038548|340-en|en|wav/p340_140.wav|||Don't hold your breath.|
038549|340-en|en|wav/p340_141.wav|||He was shaking like a leaf.|
038550|340-en|en|wav/p340_142.wav|||I have a moral dilemma.|
038551|340-en|en|wav/p340_143.wav|||It looks like a hit.|
038552|340-en|en|wav/p340_144.wav|||How did he know?|
038553|340-en|en|wav/p340_145.wav|||He will have to live with his words.|
038554|340-en|en|wav/p340_146.wav|||Openness is always the best way.|
038555|340-en|en|wav/p340_147.wav|||It added to the spectacle.|
038556|340-en|en|wav/p340_148.wav|||They are working very well.|
038557|340-en|en|wav/p340_149.wav|||And he listens to his artists as well.|
038558|340-en|en|wav/p340_150.wav|||He is advised that he has done so.|
038559|340-en|en|wav/p340_151.wav|||Annika is very, very fit.|
038560|340-en|en|wav/p340_152.wav|||This is not quite right.|
038561|340-en|en|wav/p340_153.wav|||It really is tremendous.|
038562|340-en|en|wav/p340_154.wav|||I've never regretted my decision.|
038563|340-en|en|wav/p340_155.wav|||This is a recipe for disaster.|
038564|340-en|en|wav/p340_156.wav|||The wind was coming from all directions.|
038565|340-en|en|wav/p340_157.wav|||So we started building a home.|
038566|340-en|en|wav/p340_158.wav|||He was as good as his word.|
038567|340-en|en|wav/p340_159.wav|||It will not happen overnight.|
038568|340-en|en|wav/p340_160.wav|||Surely it can't get any worse.|
038569|340-en|en|wav/p340_161.wav|||He has to learn.|
038570|340-en|en|wav/p340_162.wav|||He, too, will return.|
038571|340-en|en|wav/p340_163.wav|||What then is wrong?|
038572|340-en|en|wav/p340_164.wav|||My brother is not like that.|
038573|340-en|en|wav/p340_165.wav|||He was very fit.|
038574|340-en|en|wav/p340_166.wav|||It was very exciting.|
038575|340-en|en|wav/p340_167.wav|||It is clear that change is required.|
038576|340-en|en|wav/p340_168.wav|||They did a very good job.|
038577|340-en|en|wav/p340_169.wav|||It has been a waste of time.|
038578|340-en|en|wav/p340_170.wav|||As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.|
038579|340-en|en|wav/p340_171.wav|||He had no previous convictions.|
038580|340-en|en|wav/p340_172.wav|||It is no more than a shell.|
038581|340-en|en|wav/p340_173.wav|||And did they have sex?|
038582|340-en|en|wav/p340_174.wav|||But he was a really nice man.|
038583|340-en|en|wav/p340_175.wav|||It was very close.|
038584|340-en|en|wav/p340_176.wav|||It should be scrapped.|
038585|340-en|en|wav/p340_177.wav|||It gives us hope.|
038586|340-en|en|wav/p340_178.wav|||We can't determine that clearly.|
038587|340-en|en|wav/p340_179.wav|||They are just trying to cover up.|
038588|340-en|en|wav/p340_180.wav|||Are you the man from The Herald?|
038589|340-en|en|wav/p340_181.wav|||And that's it?|
038590|340-en|en|wav/p340_182.wav|||I came here this week to work.|
038591|340-en|en|wav/p340_183.wav|||We are really good friends.|
038592|340-en|en|wav/p340_184.wav|||But that is not an issue for now.|
038593|340-en|en|wav/p340_185.wav|||Of course the ending was fantastic.|
038594|340-en|en|wav/p340_186.wav|||I want to be frank.|
038595|340-en|en|wav/p340_187.wav|||This was an option from the beginning.|
038596|340-en|en|wav/p340_188.wav|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
038597|340-en|en|wav/p340_189.wav|||Yet it seemed to work.|
038598|340-en|en|wav/p340_190.wav|||I think it was just a tragic accident.|
038599|340-en|en|wav/p340_191.wav|||We haven't been able to go and see.|
038600|340-en|en|wav/p340_192.wav|||It works, as well.|
038601|340-en|en|wav/p340_193.wav|||I can't say anything.|
038602|340-en|en|wav/p340_194.wav|||I would be interested in another attempt.|
038603|340-en|en|wav/p340_195.wav|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
038604|340-en|en|wav/p340_196.wav|||There is no other way.|
038605|340-en|en|wav/p340_197.wav|||This was all well and good.|
038606|340-en|en|wav/p340_198.wav|||This is a disaster for us.|
038607|340-en|en|wav/p340_199.wav|||What does that mean?|
038608|340-en|en|wav/p340_200.wav|||This is your life.|
038609|340-en|en|wav/p340_201.wav|||He has seen the past.|
038610|340-en|en|wav/p340_202.wav|||He can be beaten.|
038611|340-en|en|wav/p340_203.wav|||He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.|
038612|340-en|en|wav/p340_204.wav|||Why does he do it?|
038613|340-en|en|wav/p340_205.wav|||That's my daughter acting.|
038614|340-en|en|wav/p340_206.wav|||They are very clever and very dangerous.|
038615|340-en|en|wav/p340_207.wav|||It wouldn't matter if he had.|
038616|340-en|en|wav/p340_208.wav|||We lost out a little bit.|
038617|340-en|en|wav/p340_209.wav|||Hollywood comedy is having a good week.|
038618|340-en|en|wav/p340_210.wav|||I had just taken it off.|
038619|340-en|en|wav/p340_211.wav|||The family baton is handed on.|
038620|340-en|en|wav/p340_212.wav|||We have to put pressure on Rangers.|
038621|340-en|en|wav/p340_213.wav|||It was properly reported to us.|
038622|340-en|en|wav/p340_214.wav|||He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.|
038623|340-en|en|wav/p340_215.wav|||The seller was not revealed.|
038624|340-en|en|wav/p340_216.wav|||Everything happened so quickly.|
038625|340-en|en|wav/p340_217.wav|||How can this be?|
038626|340-en|en|wav/p340_218.wav|||I am feeling a bit better.|
038627|340-en|en|wav/p340_219.wav|||Everyone here is heartbroken.|
038628|340-en|en|wav/p340_220.wav|||Not so, it seems.|
038629|340-en|en|wav/p340_221.wav|||He was also a great man.|
038630|340-en|en|wav/p340_222.wav|||We have no further comment to make.|
038631|340-en|en|wav/p340_223.wav|||This produces exactly the opposite effect.|
038632|340-en|en|wav/p340_224.wav|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
038633|340-en|en|wav/p340_225.wav|||You have to keep it on the fairways.|
038634|340-en|en|wav/p340_226.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
038635|340-en|en|wav/p340_227.wav|||So there, we won.|
038636|340-en|en|wav/p340_228.wav|||I don't like to fail.|
038637|340-en|en|wav/p340_229.wav|||I really didn't think he would.|
038638|340-en|en|wav/p340_230.wav|||He may have a long wait.|
038639|340-en|en|wav/p340_231.wav|||They have already done that.|
038640|340-en|en|wav/p340_232.wav|||Later, a very different story emerged.|
038641|340-en|en|wav/p340_233.wav|||So it should be.|
038642|340-en|en|wav/p340_234.wav|||They didn't find any substance.|
038643|340-en|en|wav/p340_235.wav|||It's hard to say.|
038644|340-en|en|wav/p340_236.wav|||Her heart was not in it.|
038645|340-en|en|wav/p340_237.wav|||After all, he is the King of Scotland.|
038646|340-en|en|wav/p340_238.wav|||Is there any prospect of this happening?|
038647|340-en|en|wav/p340_239.wav|||They are now collapsing.|
038648|340-en|en|wav/p340_240.wav|||He had been surprised by the local reaction.|
038649|340-en|en|wav/p340_241.wav|||Government funding is not a problem.|
038650|340-en|en|wav/p340_242.wav|||I'm still an amateur in that sense.|
038651|340-en|en|wav/p340_243.wav|||We just did not want to believe it.|
038652|340-en|en|wav/p340_244.wav|||The medal itself is not that important.|
038653|340-en|en|wav/p340_245.wav|||I should think so, too.|
038654|340-en|en|wav/p340_246.wav|||The time for change is now.|
038655|340-en|en|wav/p340_247.wav|||They deserved to beat us in the replay.|
038656|340-en|en|wav/p340_248.wav|||Can they be serious?|
038657|340-en|en|wav/p340_249.wav|||We've got to get this right.|
038658|340-en|en|wav/p340_250.wav|||The film was great.|
038659|340-en|en|wav/p340_251.wav|||I'm just enjoying every match.|
038660|340-en|en|wav/p340_252.wav|||They set up to win the hole.|
038661|340-en|en|wav/p340_253.wav|||I am not a liar.|
038662|340-en|en|wav/p340_254.wav|||Let's make this clear.|
038663|340-en|en|wav/p340_255.wav|||We also hope to meet the men.|
038664|340-en|en|wav/p340_256.wav|||It was quite simply, delicious.|
038665|340-en|en|wav/p340_257.wav|||I can't believe it happened.|
038666|340-en|en|wav/p340_258.wav|||Thankfully it was cleared up.|
038667|340-en|en|wav/p340_259.wav|||The game will be at a football stadium.|
038668|340-en|en|wav/p340_260.wav|||They were his words.|
038669|340-en|en|wav/p340_261.wav|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
038670|340-en|en|wav/p340_262.wav|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
038671|340-en|en|wav/p340_263.wav|||People were very confused.|
038672|340-en|en|wav/p340_264.wav|||We've had a lot of adjusting to do.|
038673|340-en|en|wav/p340_265.wav|||I am very relieved.|
038674|340-en|en|wav/p340_266.wav|||The people have been really friendly.|
038675|340-en|en|wav/p340_267.wav|||It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|
038676|340-en|en|wav/p340_268.wav|||Aberdeen were difficult to break down.|
038677|340-en|en|wav/p340_269.wav|||That, though, is not true.|
038678|340-en|en|wav/p340_270.wav|||I hope he comes back.|
038679|340-en|en|wav/p340_271.wav|||They made up for it on Saturday.|
038680|340-en|en|wav/p340_272.wav|||That was our mission.|
038681|340-en|en|wav/p340_273.wav|||I am delighted for them.|
038682|340-en|en|wav/p340_274.wav|||The second half was a different affair.|
038683|340-en|en|wav/p340_275.wav|||The scheme has been funded by the Government.|
038684|340-en|en|wav/p340_276.wav|||They might be surprised by the response.|
038685|340-en|en|wav/p340_277.wav|||I've done it all.|
038686|340-en|en|wav/p340_278.wav|||We have worked well with them for years.|
038687|340-en|en|wav/p340_279.wav|||They've had a good start as well.|
038688|340-en|en|wav/p340_280.wav|||The director's a genius.|
038689|340-en|en|wav/p340_281.wav|||One thing is clear.|
038690|340-en|en|wav/p340_282.wav|||We might never see him again.|
038691|340-en|en|wav/p340_283.wav|||Such as it is.|
038692|340-en|en|wav/p340_284.wav|||The car was just there.|
038693|340-en|en|wav/p340_285.wav|||They were very unfair to him.|
038694|340-en|en|wav/p340_286.wav|||I have spoken to my brother.|
038695|340-en|en|wav/p340_287.wav|||And that is very good indeed.|
038696|340-en|en|wav/p340_288.wav|||We could have had no new money.|
038697|340-en|en|wav/p340_289.wav|||It wasn't an easy decision.|
038698|340-en|en|wav/p340_290.wav|||It wasn't really like that at all.|
038699|340-en|en|wav/p340_291.wav|||What will happen to them now?|
038700|340-en|en|wav/p340_292.wav|||It is set in Paris.|
038701|340-en|en|wav/p340_293.wav|||The Dream is as hard as they come.|
038702|340-en|en|wav/p340_294.wav|||We are not collecting.|
038703|340-en|en|wav/p340_295.wav|||It shows the right amount of progress.|
038704|340-en|en|wav/p340_296.wav|||I thought the dancing was over.|
038705|340-en|en|wav/p340_297.wav|||I think they have got it completely right.|
038706|340-en|en|wav/p340_298.wav|||This is excellent news for Glasgow.|
038707|340-en|en|wav/p340_299.wav|||He's already made history.|
038708|340-en|en|wav/p340_300.wav|||Police have appealed for witnesses.|
038709|340-en|en|wav/p340_301.wav|||There is a lot of fear.|
038710|340-en|en|wav/p340_302.wav|||They are not left wing.|
038711|340-en|en|wav/p340_303.wav|||I've heard it all before.|
038712|340-en|en|wav/p340_304.wav|||We are not there yet.|
038713|340-en|en|wav/p340_305.wav|||We will not give up on the truth.|
038714|340-en|en|wav/p340_306.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCall.|
038715|340-en|en|wav/p340_307.wav|||Now they had it.|
038716|340-en|en|wav/p340_308.wav|||She died a few days later.|
038717|340-en|en|wav/p340_309.wav|||What is their concern?|
038718|340-en|en|wav/p340_310.wav|||The difference was amazing.|
038719|340-en|en|wav/p340_311.wav|||That is why we are here.|
038720|340-en|en|wav/p340_312.wav|||But it is historic.|
038721|340-en|en|wav/p340_313.wav|||You have to feel for the guy.|
038722|340-en|en|wav/p340_314.wav|||I have still to hear about that.|
038723|340-en|en|wav/p340_315.wav|||I'm going to win the next two.|
038724|340-en|en|wav/p340_316.wav|||You know it was good fun.|
038725|340-en|en|wav/p340_317.wav|||They want that school.|
038726|340-en|en|wav/p340_318.wav|||They have not changed at all.|
038727|340-en|en|wav/p340_319.wav|||One is investment, one is reform.|
038728|340-en|en|wav/p340_320.wav|||The last few weeks have been really bad.|
038729|340-en|en|wav/p340_321.wav|||Structural changes will never be enough.|
038730|340-en|en|wav/p340_322.wav|||I am extremely cautious.|
038731|340-en|en|wav/p340_323.wav|||That was always the danger.|
038732|340-en|en|wav/p340_324.wav|||Will they fall in love?|
038733|340-en|en|wav/p340_325.wav|||There was nothing sinister in that.|
038734|340-en|en|wav/p340_326.wav|||But don't just take my word for it.|
038735|340-en|en|wav/p340_327.wav|||Is that what it's about?|
038736|340-en|en|wav/p340_328.wav|||And the audience is a surprise.|
038737|340-en|en|wav/p340_329.wav|||They worked on it for three hours.|
038738|340-en|en|wav/p340_330.wav|||Let's make him a show.|
038739|340-en|en|wav/p340_331.wav|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
038740|340-en|en|wav/p340_332.wav|||People are using it in their daily lives.|
038741|340-en|en|wav/p340_333.wav|||It seemed so personal.|
038742|340-en|en|wav/p340_334.wav|||Would that be for men and women?|
038743|340-en|en|wav/p340_335.wav|||The government agreed to pay.|
038744|340-en|en|wav/p340_336.wav|||I think we have got the balance right.|
038745|340-en|en|wav/p340_337.wav|||It was a very terrible thing.|
038746|340-en|en|wav/p340_338.wav|||Let's not take too much for granted.|
038747|340-en|en|wav/p340_339.wav|||It has been an extremely long haul.|
038748|340-en|en|wav/p340_340.wav|||I'll need to discuss it with my family.|
038749|340-en|en|wav/p340_341.wav|||She is deeply distressed.|
038750|340-en|en|wav/p340_342.wav|||They should have listened to me.|
038751|340-en|en|wav/p340_343.wav|||Well, there can be no complaints about this one.|
038752|340-en|en|wav/p340_344.wav|||They said they would.|
038753|340-en|en|wav/p340_345.wav|||When will this change?|
038754|340-en|en|wav/p340_346.wav|||You know the score.|
038755|340-en|en|wav/p340_347.wav|||It was like someone had died.|
038756|340-en|en|wav/p340_348.wav|||I am an innocent man.|
038757|340-en|en|wav/p340_349.wav|||The improvement today was fantastic.|
038758|340-en|en|wav/p340_350.wav|||He has been under great pressure.|
038759|340-en|en|wav/p340_351.wav|||I'm looking forward to coming home.|
038760|340-en|en|wav/p340_352.wav|||She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|
038761|340-en|en|wav/p340_353.wav|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|
038762|340-en|en|wav/p340_354.wav|||He was elected as a councillor last year.|
038763|340-en|en|wav/p340_355.wav|||I just did not cope with the pressure.|
038764|340-en|en|wav/p340_356.wav|||But he did not appear.|
038765|340-en|en|wav/p340_357.wav|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
038766|340-en|en|wav/p340_358.wav|||The time was right.|
038767|340-en|en|wav/p340_359.wav|||It all happened so quickly.|
038768|340-en|en|wav/p340_360.wav|||It is working well.|
038769|340-en|en|wav/p340_361.wav|||They really want to do it.|
038770|340-en|en|wav/p340_362.wav|||He said nothing of the sort.|
038771|340-en|en|wav/p340_363.wav|||Governments will have to respond.|
038772|340-en|en|wav/p340_364.wav|||It simply doesn't happen.|
038773|340-en|en|wav/p340_365.wav|||We wanted to do something different.|
038774|340-en|en|wav/p340_366.wav|||The past is history, not destiny.|
038775|340-en|en|wav/p340_367.wav|||I love it here.|
038776|340-en|en|wav/p340_368.wav|||Things are on track.|
038777|340-en|en|wav/p340_369.wav|||Frankly it was disgusting.|
038778|340-en|en|wav/p340_370.wav|||It is a tragedy for the area.|
038779|340-en|en|wav/p340_371.wav|||He was not entirely correct.|
038780|340-en|en|wav/p340_372.wav|||I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.|
038781|340-en|en|wav/p340_373.wav|||War is not the action.|
038782|340-en|en|wav/p340_374.wav|||There are not enough of them.|
038783|340-en|en|wav/p340_375.wav|||It has been a frustrating one.|
038784|340-en|en|wav/p340_376.wav|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
038785|340-en|en|wav/p340_377.wav|||But we wouldn't want them any other way.|
038786|340-en|en|wav/p340_378.wav|||What's in a name?|
038787|340-en|en|wav/p340_379.wav|||It feels like a winner already.|
038788|340-en|en|wav/p340_380.wav|||They are expected to be released today.|
038789|340-en|en|wav/p340_381.wav|||There was no question of him not impressing.|
038790|340-en|en|wav/p340_382.wav|||We were all afraid.|
038791|340-en|en|wav/p340_383.wav|||I hadn't had that before.|
038792|340-en|en|wav/p340_384.wav|||We have a plan in place.|
038793|340-en|en|wav/p340_385.wav|||That is to miss the point.|
038794|340-en|en|wav/p340_386.wav|||It will be a new experience.|
038795|340-en|en|wav/p340_387.wav|||I didn't see it.|
038796|340-en|en|wav/p340_388.wav|||Scotland has lost a great religious leader.|
038797|340-en|en|wav/p340_389.wav|||IT had to happen.|
038798|340-en|en|wav/p340_390.wav|||It is a challenge for all of us.|
038799|340-en|en|wav/p340_391.wav|||The children are fine.|
038800|340-en|en|wav/p340_392.wav|||I don't believe in God.|
038801|340-en|en|wav/p340_393.wav|||There's also the point.|
038802|340-en|en|wav/p340_394.wav|||It's good to be back.|
038803|340-en|en|wav/p340_395.wav|||It wasn't the second one.|
038804|340-en|en|wav/p340_396.wav|||He got his degree.|
038805|340-en|en|wav/p340_397.wav|||And rugby fans can help.|
038806|340-en|en|wav/p340_398.wav|||Detectives are still working on the case.|
038807|340-en|en|wav/p340_399.wav|||I reported it but nothing was done.|
038808|340-en|en|wav/p340_400.wav|||They were not defeated.|
038809|340-en|en|wav/p340_401.wav|||There was much to be positive about.|
038810|340-en|en|wav/p340_402.wav|||It wants them to go home.|
038811|340-en|en|wav/p340_403.wav|||I had a ball today.|
038812|340-en|en|wav/p340_404.wav|||Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.|
038813|340-en|en|wav/p340_405.wav|||He said no survivors had been found.|
038814|340-en|en|wav/p340_406.wav|||It is the end of an era.|
038815|340-en|en|wav/p340_407.wav|||We shall not do that.|
038816|340-en|en|wav/p340_408.wav|||My daughter was really, really innocent.|
038817|340-en|en|wav/p340_409.wav|||It will not be easy.|
038818|340-en|en|wav/p340_410.wav|||Once again, he refused.|
038819|340-en|en|wav/p340_411.wav|||And it will be a challenge.|
038820|340-en|en|wav/p340_412.wav|||And Scotland is no different.|

039044|341-en|en|wav/p341_212.wav|||I asked why he had come.|
039045|341-en|en|wav/p341_213.wav|||He was a soldier.|

039066|341-en|en|wav/p341_234.wav|||I would have dropped out otherwise.|

039073|341-en|en|wav/p341_242.wav|||I think he has undergone a sea change.|
039074|341-en|en|wav/p341_243.wav|||One must hope not!|
039075|341-en|en|wav/p341_244.wav|||It was a big day.|

039088|341-en|en|wav/p341_257.wav|||That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?|
039089|341-en|en|wav/p341_258.wav|||He loves the big occasions.|
039090|341-en|en|wav/p341_259.wav|||Our system is archaic.|

039102|341-en|en|wav/p341_271.wav|||And we still have to pay his salary.|
039103|341-en|en|wav/p341_272.wav|||Also, he was flawed.|
039104|341-en|en|wav/p341_273.wav|||Having guidelines in advance is helpful.|

039111|341-en|en|wav/p341_280.wav|||I hope my successor will do the same.|
039112|341-en|en|wav/p341_281.wav|||The manager knew me very well.|
039113|341-en|en|wav/p341_282.wav|||I have been totally taken aback by this.|
039114|341-en|en|wav/p341_283.wav|||Are you in this movie?|

039128|341-en|en|wav/p341_297.wav|||But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.|
039129|341-en|en|wav/p341_298.wav|||It's the curse of our time, irony.|
039130|341-en|en|wav/p341_299.wav|||That was enough for the committee.|
039131|341-en|en|wav/p341_300.wav|||It's a source of deep concern.|

039133|341-en|en|wav/p341_302.wav|||But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.|

039141|341-en|en|wav/p341_310.wav|||What are you going to do exactly?|
039142|341-en|en|wav/p341_311.wav|||We have lost the round, but not the fight.|
039143|341-en|en|wav/p341_312.wav|||There is nothing like a fresh start.|

039152|341-en|en|wav/p341_321.wav|||No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.|
039153|341-en|en|wav/p341_322.wav|||I stayed away from the defence.|
039154|341-en|en|wav/p341_323.wav|||We do need to get the message across.|
039155|341-en|en|wav/p341_324.wav|||Instead, she just went away.|
039156|341-en|en|wav/p341_325.wav|||That did not go down well.|

039175|341-en|en|wav/p341_344.wav|||We have to go for it.|
039176|341-en|en|wav/p341_345.wav|||I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.|
039177|341-en|en|wav/p341_346.wav|||Barry will be able to handle this.|
039178|341-en|en|wav/p341_347.wav|||This is entirely appropriate and overdue.|
039179|341-en|en|wav/p341_348.wav|||The urgency is real.|
039180|341-en|en|wav/p341_349.wav|||I've already got them in.|

039229|341-en|en|wav/p341_398.wav|||We've still got a say in this.|
039230|341-en|en|wav/p341_399.wav|||Things are going very well.|
039231|341-en|en|wav/p341_400.wav|||She can't say where she was, what she did.|
039232|341-en|en|wav/p341_401.wav|||I'll take what comes along.|
039233|341-en|en|wav/p341_402.wav|||Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.|
039234|341-en|en|wav/p341_403.wav|||She will just have wanted her baby.|
039235|341-en|en|wav/p341_404.wav|||Golf has lost a great character.|
039236|341-en|en|wav/p341_405.wav|||You have to have some hope and faith.|
039237|341-en|en|wav/p341_406.wav|||They hold on for many years.|
039238|341-en|en|wav/p341_407.wav|||However, the report was incorrect.|
039239|341-en|en|wav/p341_408.wav|||Women reported more depression than men.|
039240|341-en|en|wav/p341_409.wav|||He needs to be.|
039241|341-en|en|wav/p341_410.wav|||The euro is your money, it is our money.|
039242|343-en|en|wav/p343_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
039243|343-en|en|wav/p343_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
039244|343-en|en|wav/p343_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
039245|343-en|en|wav/p343_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
039246|343-en|en|wav/p343_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
039247|343-en|en|wav/p343_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
039248|343-en|en|wav/p343_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
039249|343-en|en|wav/p343_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
039250|343-en|en|wav/p343_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
039251|343-en|en|wav/p343_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
039252|343-en|en|wav/p343_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039253|343-en|en|wav/p343_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
039254|343-en|en|wav/p343_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
039255|343-en|en|wav/p343_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
039256|343-en|en|wav/p343_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
039257|343-en|en|wav/p343_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
039258|343-en|en|wav/p343_019.wav|||Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
039259|343-en|en|wav/p343_020.wav|||Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039260|343-en|en|wav/p343_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039261|343-en|en|wav/p343_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
039263|343-en|en|wav/p343_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
039264|343-en|en|wav/p343_025.wav|||I've got a long way to go.|
039265|343-en|en|wav/p343_026.wav|||I'll go to the races.|
039266|343-en|en|wav/p343_027.wav|||We will be back next year.|
039267|343-en|en|wav/p343_028.wav|||I was very, very pleased with our display.|
039268|343-en|en|wav/p343_029.wav|||It is a crucial award.|
039269|343-en|en|wav/p343_030.wav|||People don't feel safe, including me.|
039270|343-en|en|wav/p343_031.wav|||Survival is our aim.|
039271|343-en|en|wav/p343_032.wav|||But it might have done.|
039272|343-en|en|wav/p343_033.wav|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
039273|343-en|en|wav/p343_034.wav|||What can you do?|
039274|343-en|en|wav/p343_035.wav|||I read it every year.|
039275|343-en|en|wav/p343_036.wav|||I go in for the parts.|
039276|343-en|en|wav/p343_037.wav|||It should be the reverse.|
039277|343-en|en|wav/p343_038.wav|||We are a team of hard workers.|
039278|343-en|en|wav/p343_039.wav|||It is up to Ann.|
039279|343-en|en|wav/p343_040.wav|||And you know something?|
039280|343-en|en|wav/p343_041.wav|||We were with him the whole time.|
039281|343-en|en|wav/p343_042.wav|||That was the theory, anyway.|
039282|343-en|en|wav/p343_043.wav|||We've all been here before.|
039283|343-en|en|wav/p343_044.wav|||I had troubles with the producers.|
039284|343-en|en|wav/p343_045.wav|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
039285|343-en|en|wav/p343_046.wav|||He died the following year.|
039286|343-en|en|wav/p343_047.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
039287|343-en|en|wav/p343_048.wav|||He is trying really hard.|
039288|343-en|en|wav/p343_049.wav|||I have no doubt about that.|
039289|343-en|en|wav/p343_050.wav|||It is a beautiful country.|
039290|343-en|en|wav/p343_051.wav|||I expect a rapid response.|
039291|343-en|en|wav/p343_052.wav|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
039292|343-en|en|wav/p343_053.wav|||This was never a support group.|
039293|343-en|en|wav/p343_054.wav|||I must take a seat.|
039294|343-en|en|wav/p343_055.wav|||My mother is a widow.|
039295|343-en|en|wav/p343_056.wav|||Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.|
039296|343-en|en|wav/p343_057.wav|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
039297|343-en|en|wav/p343_058.wav|||The matter will come up again.|
039298|343-en|en|wav/p343_059.wav|||I don't believe in gesture politics.|
039299|343-en|en|wav/p343_060.wav|||The decision is purely down to the clinic.|
039300|343-en|en|wav/p343_061.wav|||He should be a great asset.|
039301|343-en|en|wav/p343_062.wav|||But that's another story for another day.|
039302|343-en|en|wav/p343_063.wav|||One thing is sure.|
039303|343-en|en|wav/p343_064.wav|||He has really done well.|
039304|343-en|en|wav/p343_065.wav|||I'm just delighted to take it.|
039305|343-en|en|wav/p343_066.wav|||This happened on three days inside a week.|
039306|343-en|en|wav/p343_067.wav|||Funding needs to be long term.|
039307|343-en|en|wav/p343_068.wav|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
039308|343-en|en|wav/p343_069.wav|||It was just awful.|
039309|343-en|en|wav/p343_070.wav|||That is really all.|
039310|343-en|en|wav/p343_071.wav|||We played too deeply.|
039311|343-en|en|wav/p343_072.wav|||We could have got three medals.|
039312|343-en|en|wav/p343_073.wav|||I am ready to go.|
039313|343-en|en|wav/p343_074.wav|||We are still suffering from that.|
039314|343-en|en|wav/p343_075.wav|||The script was funny.|
039315|343-en|en|wav/p343_076.wav|||We are at the crossroads.|
039316|343-en|en|wav/p343_077.wav|||I am about protecting the state pension.|
039317|343-en|en|wav/p343_078.wav|||They were at school together.|
039318|343-en|en|wav/p343_079.wav|||I am looking forward to getting home.|
039319|343-en|en|wav/p343_080.wav|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
039320|343-en|en|wav/p343_081.wav|||Once they go away they won't come back.|
039321|343-en|en|wav/p343_082.wav|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
039322|343-en|en|wav/p343_083.wav|||That was the easy election.|
039323|343-en|en|wav/p343_084.wav|||I didn't understand it.|
039324|343-en|en|wav/p343_085.wav|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|
039325|343-en|en|wav/p343_086.wav|||Both sides have been hit by injury.|
039326|343-en|en|wav/p343_087.wav|||No one was listening.|
039327|343-en|en|wav/p343_088.wav|||I will report in the spring.|
039328|343-en|en|wav/p343_089.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
039329|343-en|en|wav/p343_090.wav|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
039330|343-en|en|wav/p343_091.wav|||It's terrible that this is happening.|
039331|343-en|en|wav/p343_092.wav|||He's got the same story.|
039332|343-en|en|wav/p343_093.wav|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
039333|343-en|en|wav/p343_094.wav|||It is par for the course, of course.|
039334|343-en|en|wav/p343_095.wav|||And so it goes on.|
039335|343-en|en|wav/p343_096.wav|||The winner will be announced next month.|
039336|343-en|en|wav/p343_097.wav|||What was this?|
039337|343-en|en|wav/p343_098.wav|||I am not a fan of books.|
039338|343-en|en|wav/p343_099.wav|||It may well have been.|
039339|343-en|en|wav/p343_100.wav|||Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.|
039340|343-en|en|wav/p343_101.wav|||We can only go up.|
039341|343-en|en|wav/p343_102.wav|||I am not a doctor.|
039342|343-en|en|wav/p343_103.wav|||It is all in the mind.|
039343|343-en|en|wav/p343_104.wav|||And we have beaten them before.|
039344|343-en|en|wav/p343_105.wav|||Many others are subjected to violence by men.|
039345|343-en|en|wav/p343_106.wav|||Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.|
039346|343-en|en|wav/p343_107.wav|||I am not a paedophile.|
039347|343-en|en|wav/p343_108.wav|||I've got to get noticed!|
039348|343-en|en|wav/p343_109.wav|||Not that it was needed.|
039349|343-en|en|wav/p343_110.wav|||It's up to them to decide.|
039350|343-en|en|wav/p343_111.wav|||But we can't have a casino.|
039351|343-en|en|wav/p343_112.wav|||I would love to play in Europe again.|
039352|343-en|en|wav/p343_113.wav|||The odds are that it will.|
039353|343-en|en|wav/p343_114.wav|||After this, they were always in the driving seat.|
039354|343-en|en|wav/p343_115.wav|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
039355|343-en|en|wav/p343_116.wav|||But let's not get ahead of ourselves.|
039356|343-en|en|wav/p343_117.wav|||He also has property interests in the country.|
039357|343-en|en|wav/p343_118.wav|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
039358|343-en|en|wav/p343_119.wav|||The hearing was expected to last six weeks.|
039359|343-en|en|wav/p343_120.wav|||I cannot believe this decision.|
039360|343-en|en|wav/p343_121.wav|||This decision is destroying my family.|
039361|343-en|en|wav/p343_122.wav|||Why is that?|
039362|343-en|en|wav/p343_123.wav|||Well, the big day has arrived.|
039363|343-en|en|wav/p343_124.wav|||We reckon we can do very well.|
039364|343-en|en|wav/p343_125.wav|||But it's been kept to a minimum.|
039365|343-en|en|wav/p343_126.wav|||It has been a great day.|
039366|343-en|en|wav/p343_127.wav|||We are not with you.|
039367|343-en|en|wav/p343_128.wav|||Then came the crunch.|
039368|343-en|en|wav/p343_129.wav|||If so, they were wrong.|
039369|343-en|en|wav/p343_130.wav|||It is open season on the Old Firm.|
039370|343-en|en|wav/p343_131.wav|||The answer is maybe.|
039371|343-en|en|wav/p343_132.wav|||The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|
039372|343-en|en|wav/p343_133.wav|||The referee had a shocking game.|
039373|343-en|en|wav/p343_134.wav|||I haven't been able to do it since.|
039374|343-en|en|wav/p343_135.wav|||It's about doing things.|
039375|343-en|en|wav/p343_136.wav|||For a few years we had good fun.|
039376|343-en|en|wav/p343_137.wav|||All the pressure will be on him.|
039377|343-en|en|wav/p343_139.wav|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
039378|343-en|en|wav/p343_140.wav|||That was a good effort.|
039379|343-en|en|wav/p343_141.wav|||We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|
039380|343-en|en|wav/p343_142.wav|||He must not be removed from office.|
039381|343-en|en|wav/p343_143.wav|||He had finally had enough.|
039382|343-en|en|wav/p343_144.wav|||But not all were so defiant.|
039383|343-en|en|wav/p343_145.wav|||We are not going to get carried away.|
039384|343-en|en|wav/p343_146.wav|||I told that to the police.|
039385|343-en|en|wav/p343_147.wav|||On the other hand, the poster did not help.|
039386|343-en|en|wav/p343_148.wav|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
039387|343-en|en|wav/p343_149.wav|||But when we do it it is great.|
039388|343-en|en|wav/p343_150.wav|||I'm going to win the gold.|
039389|343-en|en|wav/p343_151.wav|||He pleaded for caution.|
039390|343-en|en|wav/p343_152.wav|||It always had to be about the gym.|
039391|343-en|en|wav/p343_153.wav|||Only one got through.|
039392|343-en|en|wav/p343_154.wav|||It's like a garage.|
039393|343-en|en|wav/p343_155.wav|||They've been wonderful to me.|
039394|343-en|en|wav/p343_157.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
039395|343-en|en|wav/p343_158.wav|||It is a traffic warden.|
039396|343-en|en|wav/p343_159.wav|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
039397|343-en|en|wav/p343_160.wav|||It had been played at festivals.|
039398|343-en|en|wav/p343_161.wav|||That never came to court as a charge.|
039399|343-en|en|wav/p343_162.wav|||Dancing was her life.|
039400|343-en|en|wav/p343_163.wav|||The latter way is my way.|
039401|343-en|en|wav/p343_164.wav|||Staff have been informed.|
039402|343-en|en|wav/p343_165.wav|||It is one of those things.|
039403|343-en|en|wav/p343_166.wav|||His is a success story by any standard.|
039404|343-en|en|wav/p343_167.wav|||Are his works inside out?|
039405|343-en|en|wav/p343_168.wav|||He can do no wrong.|
039406|343-en|en|wav/p343_169.wav|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
039407|343-en|en|wav/p343_170.wav|||Do they have to create seven majors?|
039408|343-en|en|wav/p343_171.wav|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
039409|343-en|en|wav/p343_172.wav|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
039410|343-en|en|wav/p343_173.wav|||Is something which we just don't do.|
039411|343-en|en|wav/p343_174.wav|||That began as an accident.|
039412|343-en|en|wav/p343_175.wav|||It is, though the law is not clear cut.|
039413|343-en|en|wav/p343_176.wav|||He will want to utilise the midfield.|
039414|343-en|en|wav/p343_177.wav|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
039415|343-en|en|wav/p343_178.wav|||I am looking forward to this film.|
039416|343-en|en|wav/p343_179.wav|||This has been very frustrating for him.|
039417|343-en|en|wav/p343_180.wav|||The talking cannot go on too long.|
039418|343-en|en|wav/p343_181.wav|||I've got a young family.|
039419|343-en|en|wav/p343_182.wav|||I hope that that will be forthcoming.|
039420|343-en|en|wav/p343_183.wav|||But experience is a wonderful thing.|
039421|343-en|en|wav/p343_184.wav|||Footage has been passed on to the police.|
039422|343-en|en|wav/p343_185.wav|||Of course, there was still much to be done.|
039423|343-en|en|wav/p343_186.wav|||If he does, he has a real chance of gold.|
039424|343-en|en|wav/p343_187.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
039425|343-en|en|wav/p343_188.wav|||It was good today.|
039426|343-en|en|wav/p343_189.wav|||She really suffered for her art.|
039427|343-en|en|wav/p343_190.wav|||I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|
039428|343-en|en|wav/p343_191.wav|||That tells you something.|
039429|343-en|en|wav/p343_192.wav|||It has been a magical moment.|
039430|343-en|en|wav/p343_193.wav|||Is that not uncanny?|
039431|343-en|en|wav/p343_194.wav|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
039432|343-en|en|wav/p343_195.wav|||The hotel was huge.|
039433|343-en|en|wav/p343_196.wav|||These days are over.|
039434|343-en|en|wav/p343_197.wav|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
039435|343-en|en|wav/p343_198.wav|||Well, you can have a tree.|
039436|343-en|en|wav/p343_199.wav|||Or so it is hoped.|
039437|343-en|en|wav/p343_201.wav|||He said to give a local injection.|
039438|343-en|en|wav/p343_202.wav|||This is an internal matter.|
039439|343-en|en|wav/p343_203.wav|||Entries from the event are still being accepted.|
039440|343-en|en|wav/p343_204.wav|||They made such decisions in London.|
039441|343-en|en|wav/p343_205.wav|||That has proved to be a lasting lesson.|
039442|343-en|en|wav/p343_206.wav|||I was influenced by all of these things.|
039443|343-en|en|wav/p343_207.wav|||He is helping police with their inquiries.|
039444|343-en|en|wav/p343_208.wav|||The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|
039445|343-en|en|wav/p343_209.wav|||Children also died in Britain.|
039446|343-en|en|wav/p343_210.wav|||I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.|
039447|343-en|en|wav/p343_211.wav|||We want to get there.|
039448|343-en|en|wav/p343_213.wav|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
039449|343-en|en|wav/p343_214.wav|||He said he would appeal the sentences.|
039450|343-en|en|wav/p343_215.wav|||The hearing was fair.|
039451|343-en|en|wav/p343_216.wav|||He has the edge.|
039452|343-en|en|wav/p343_217.wav|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
039453|343-en|en|wav/p343_218.wav|||If he leaves, the band is finished.|
039454|343-en|en|wav/p343_219.wav|||He saw it all as a big game.|
039455|343-en|en|wav/p343_220.wav|||I didn't actually work up a speech.|
039456|343-en|en|wav/p343_221.wav|||Here we have not had one hour.|
039457|343-en|en|wav/p343_222.wav|||That was never their agenda.|
039458|343-en|en|wav/p343_223.wav|||But he kept on repeating it.|
039459|343-en|en|wav/p343_224.wav|||She is currently in foster care.|
039460|343-en|en|wav/p343_225.wav|||That's the only thing that matters.|
039461|343-en|en|wav/p343_226.wav|||They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
039462|343-en|en|wav/p343_227.wav|||The service will only survive with change.|
039463|343-en|en|wav/p343_228.wav|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
039464|343-en|en|wav/p343_229.wav|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
039465|343-en|en|wav/p343_230.wav|||You have a very persuasive president.|
039466|343-en|en|wav/p343_231.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
039467|343-en|en|wav/p343_232.wav|||She has not returned to work.|
039468|343-en|en|wav/p343_233.wav|||We could learn a lot from them.|
039469|343-en|en|wav/p343_234.wav|||He is the saviour of South Africa.|
039470|343-en|en|wav/p343_235.wav|||The players are obviously keen to do well.|
039471|343-en|en|wav/p343_236.wav|||Men should avoid it like the plague.|
039472|343-en|en|wav/p343_237.wav|||It's really good fun.|
039473|343-en|en|wav/p343_238.wav|||Our positions remains unchanged.|
039474|343-en|en|wav/p343_239.wav|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
039475|343-en|en|wav/p343_240.wav|||Is a drug dealer?|
039476|343-en|en|wav/p343_241.wav|||We did not complete the process.|
039477|343-en|en|wav/p343_242.wav|||Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.|
039478|343-en|en|wav/p343_243.wav|||Where are you taking her?|
039479|343-en|en|wav/p343_244.wav|||The weather forecast isn't good.|
039480|343-en|en|wav/p343_245.wav|||They have not been named.|
039481|343-en|en|wav/p343_246.wav|||He died later in hospital.|
039482|343-en|en|wav/p343_247.wav|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
039483|343-en|en|wav/p343_248.wav|||He had a great game.|
039484|343-en|en|wav/p343_249.wav|||It's still got that at its heart.|
039485|343-en|en|wav/p343_250.wav|||Actually, nothing much will change.|
039486|343-en|en|wav/p343_251.wav|||We will turn the corner.|
039487|343-en|en|wav/p343_252.wav|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
039488|343-en|en|wav/p343_253.wav|||There were too many mistakes.|
039489|343-en|en|wav/p343_254.wav|||He says it often enough.|
039490|343-en|en|wav/p343_255.wav|||However, my position remains the same.|
039491|343-en|en|wav/p343_256.wav|||It was totally out of the blue.|
039492|343-en|en|wav/p343_257.wav|||Horses are not affected.|
039493|343-en|en|wav/p343_258.wav|||It went on forever.|
039494|343-en|en|wav/p343_259.wav|||I'm not going to change from it.|
039495|343-en|en|wav/p343_260.wav|||And they are different.|
039496|343-en|en|wav/p343_261.wav|||It would have been very easily done.|
039497|343-en|en|wav/p343_262.wav|||He knows the course.|
039498|343-en|en|wav/p343_263.wav|||That idea is rubbish.|
039499|343-en|en|wav/p343_264.wav|||There is no room for error.|
039500|343-en|en|wav/p343_265.wav|||Worry can have that effect on some citizens.|
039501|343-en|en|wav/p343_266.wav|||As, indeed, they would be.|
039502|343-en|en|wav/p343_267.wav|||If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.|
039503|343-en|en|wav/p343_268.wav|||We are all suffering.|
039504|343-en|en|wav/p343_269.wav|||People should make their own decisions.|
039505|343-en|en|wav/p343_270.wav|||That is a question for the next manager.|
039506|343-en|en|wav/p343_271.wav|||I knew people on that committee.|
039507|343-en|en|wav/p343_273.wav|||Again, we were lucky.|
039508|343-en|en|wav/p343_274.wav|||There was no argument.|
039509|343-en|en|wav/p343_275.wav|||He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.|
039510|343-en|en|wav/p343_276.wav|||She is a valuable member of Government.|
039511|343-en|en|wav/p343_277.wav|||I just need a bit of luck.|
039512|343-en|en|wav/p343_278.wav|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
039513|343-en|en|wav/p343_279.wav|||We are talking about one family.|
039514|343-en|en|wav/p343_280.wav|||He is not a pathetic figure.|
039515|343-en|en|wav/p343_281.wav|||The error appeared in a warrant.|
039516|343-en|en|wav/p343_282.wav|||Everything is so new.|
039517|343-en|en|wav/p343_283.wav|||It may take time to get it back.|
039518|343-en|en|wav/p343_284.wav|||Would they work together again?|
039519|343-en|en|wav/p343_285.wav|||I can feel the sound inside.|
039520|343-en|en|wav/p343_286.wav|||The answer is yes.|
039521|343-en|en|wav/p343_287.wav|||I believe in debate and dialogue.|
039522|343-en|en|wav/p343_288.wav|||The second aspect was the fear of failure.|
039523|343-en|en|wav/p343_289.wav|||That is a personal matter.|
039524|343-en|en|wav/p343_290.wav|||The princess has had other health problems.|
039525|343-en|en|wav/p343_291.wav|||I would rather say nothing at the moment.|
039526|343-en|en|wav/p343_292.wav|||The clarity is vital.|
039527|343-en|en|wav/p343_293.wav|||I could not sit in the stands.|
039528|343-en|en|wav/p343_294.wav|||He had a decision to make.|
039529|343-en|en|wav/p343_295.wav|||Strikers like to go to the ground.|
039530|343-en|en|wav/p343_296.wav|||It makes no influence on the public.|
039531|343-en|en|wav/p343_297.wav|||It's ahead of Labour.|
039532|343-en|en|wav/p343_298.wav|||It's the whole package.|
039533|343-en|en|wav/p343_299.wav|||I was totally wrong.|
039534|343-en|en|wav/p343_300.wav|||This has got to stop.|
039535|343-en|en|wav/p343_301.wav|||It was a matter of chance.|
039536|343-en|en|wav/p343_302.wav|||There is no point of looking any further.|
039537|343-en|en|wav/p343_303.wav|||It is a real concern.|
039538|343-en|en|wav/p343_304.wav|||Is it the flight?|
039539|343-en|en|wav/p343_306.wav|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
039540|343-en|en|wav/p343_307.wav|||Scotland doesn't even have a target.|
039541|343-en|en|wav/p343_308.wav|||They really shouldn't have put it out.|
039542|343-en|en|wav/p343_309.wav|||A compromise is essential.|
039543|343-en|en|wav/p343_310.wav|||Last night, the company could not be contacted.|
039544|343-en|en|wav/p343_311.wav|||They need to be involved.|
039545|343-en|en|wav/p343_312.wav|||It was not a cover-up.|
039546|343-en|en|wav/p343_313.wav|||The children continue to talk to us.|
039547|343-en|en|wav/p343_314.wav|||You know the sort of thing.|
039548|343-en|en|wav/p343_315.wav|||I cannot say too much about them.|
039549|343-en|en|wav/p343_316.wav|||She went home from school and never returned.|
039550|343-en|en|wav/p343_317.wav|||I will work on her.|
039551|343-en|en|wav/p343_318.wav|||We told them in August.|
039552|343-en|en|wav/p343_319.wav|||It is not easy to live in Russia.|
039553|343-en|en|wav/p343_320.wav|||Green is desperate to play on The Open.|
039554|343-en|en|wav/p343_321.wav|||What on earth is happening to rugby?|
039555|343-en|en|wav/p343_322.wav|||It is now being examined.|
039556|343-en|en|wav/p343_323.wav|||It is so out of character.|
039557|343-en|en|wav/p343_324.wav|||Otherwise we would all pay the price.|
039558|343-en|en|wav/p343_325.wav|||Our thoughts are with her.|
039559|343-en|en|wav/p343_326.wav|||It is time, he said.|
039560|343-en|en|wav/p343_327.wav|||Everyone believes in it.|
039561|343-en|en|wav/p343_328.wav|||We must learn to finish.|
039562|343-en|en|wav/p343_331.wav|||He was a one off.|
039563|343-en|en|wav/p343_332.wav|||That should give me a chance.|
039564|343-en|en|wav/p343_333.wav|||Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|
039565|343-en|en|wav/p343_334.wav|||It is my last chance.|
039566|343-en|en|wav/p343_335.wav|||We played them off the pitch.|
039567|343-en|en|wav/p343_336.wav|||The service from the other players was super.|
039568|343-en|en|wav/p343_337.wav|||That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.|
039569|343-en|en|wav/p343_338.wav|||He didn't let me down.|
039570|343-en|en|wav/p343_339.wav|||You have been warned.|
039571|343-en|en|wav/p343_340.wav|||We're not comparing like with like.|
039572|343-en|en|wav/p343_341.wav|||I started on fire a couple of times.|
039573|343-en|en|wav/p343_342.wav|||The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.|
039574|343-en|en|wav/p343_343.wav|||It wasn't good, but we'll get better.|
039575|343-en|en|wav/p343_344.wav|||They will be up for it for sure.|
039576|343-en|en|wav/p343_345.wav|||So you let me know.|
039577|343-en|en|wav/p343_346.wav|||He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.|
039578|343-en|en|wav/p343_347.wav|||That will just be the beginning.|
039579|343-en|en|wav/p343_348.wav|||No one can say that about me.|
039580|343-en|en|wav/p343_349.wav|||That had not happened on this occasion.|
039581|343-en|en|wav/p343_350.wav|||After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|
039582|343-en|en|wav/p343_351.wav|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
039583|343-en|en|wav/p343_352.wav|||At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|
039584|343-en|en|wav/p343_353.wav|||It is safe in our hands.|
039585|343-en|en|wav/p343_354.wav|||HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|
039586|343-en|en|wav/p343_355.wav|||We will need to look at that.|
039587|343-en|en|wav/p343_356.wav|||It comes down to the police in England.|
039588|343-en|en|wav/p343_357.wav|||Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|
039589|343-en|en|wav/p343_358.wav|||It is a gamble.|
039590|343-en|en|wav/p343_359.wav|||I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|
039591|343-en|en|wav/p343_360.wav|||The tribunal continues today.|
039592|343-en|en|wav/p343_361.wav|||These things have not happened by accident.|
039593|343-en|en|wav/p343_362.wav|||So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|
039594|343-en|en|wav/p343_363.wav|||Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|
039595|343-en|en|wav/p343_364.wav|||There's a hint of classical.|
039596|343-en|en|wav/p343_365.wav|||We had to take action to protect them.|
039597|343-en|en|wav/p343_366.wav|||Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.|
039598|343-en|en|wav/p343_367.wav|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
039599|343-en|en|wav/p343_368.wav|||He is a visionary.|
039600|343-en|en|wav/p343_369.wav|||The warning was lifted late last night.|
039601|343-en|en|wav/p343_370.wav|||There is always the smell.|
039602|343-en|en|wav/p343_371.wav|||I have to take some of the blame.|
039603|343-en|en|wav/p343_372.wav|||And if he hasn't become a musician?|
039604|343-en|en|wav/p343_374.wav|||He is lying to save his skin.|
039605|343-en|en|wav/p343_375.wav|||You have to do your research.|
039606|343-en|en|wav/p343_376.wav|||He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.|
039607|343-en|en|wav/p343_377.wav|||He took away my childhood.|
039608|343-en|en|wav/p343_378.wav|||I have spoken to the skipper.|
039609|343-en|en|wav/p343_379.wav|||The call was ignored.|
039610|343-en|en|wav/p343_381.wav|||It has happened, and that is the end of the story.|
039611|343-en|en|wav/p343_382.wav|||We don't do this for everyone, of course.|
039612|343-en|en|wav/p343_383.wav|||And there is another problem.|
039613|343-en|en|wav/p343_384.wav|||That is the theory.|
039614|343-en|en|wav/p343_385.wav|||It almost certainly is.|
039615|343-en|en|wav/p343_386.wav|||They will have five minutes to decide.|
039616|343-en|en|wav/p343_387.wav|||Because it's a secret.|
039617|343-en|en|wav/p343_388.wav|||My wife and family are the support system.|
039618|343-en|en|wav/p343_389.wav|||The body follows the mind.|
039619|343-en|en|wav/p343_390.wav|||I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.|
039620|343-en|en|wav/p343_391.wav|||They are there to help us.|
039621|343-en|en|wav/p343_392.wav|||It just isn't a defining issue for them.|
039622|343-en|en|wav/p343_393.wav|||You take a risk.|
039623|343-en|en|wav/p343_394.wav|||Which he is, too.|
039624|343-en|en|wav/p343_395.wav|||Each one is as good as the other.|
039625|343-en|en|wav/p343_396.wav|||Sub Not Used, McArthur.|
039626|343-en|en|wav/p343_397.wav|||I have hardly any commitments.|
039627|343-en|en|wav/p343_398.wav|||There is no formula.|
039628|343-en|en|wav/p343_399.wav|||The role was a knockout, but really difficult.|
039629|343-en|en|wav/p343_400.wav|||I love the feel of the place.|
039630|345-en|en|wav/p345_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
039631|345-en|en|wav/p345_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
039632|345-en|en|wav/p345_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
039633|345-en|en|wav/p345_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
039634|345-en|en|wav/p345_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
039635|345-en|en|wav/p345_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
039636|345-en|en|wav/p345_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
039637|345-en|en|wav/p345_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
039638|345-en|en|wav/p345_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
039639|345-en|en|wav/p345_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
039640|345-en|en|wav/p345_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
039641|345-en|en|wav/p345_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039642|345-en|en|wav/p345_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
039643|345-en|en|wav/p345_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
039644|345-en|en|wav/p345_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
039645|345-en|en|wav/p345_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
039646|345-en|en|wav/p345_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
039647|345-en|en|wav/p345_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
039648|345-en|en|wav/p345_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
039649|345-en|en|wav/p345_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039650|345-en|en|wav/p345_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039651|345-en|en|wav/p345_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
039652|345-en|en|wav/p345_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
039653|345-en|en|wav/p345_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
039654|345-en|en|wav/p345_025.wav|||This is a new era.|
039655|345-en|en|wav/p345_026.wav|||I want to go home.|
039656|345-en|en|wav/p345_027.wav|||All the people here are local.|
039657|345-en|en|wav/p345_028.wav|||The racist abuse was terrible.|
039658|345-en|en|wav/p345_029.wav|||What is the new religion?|
039659|345-en|en|wav/p345_030.wav|||The Farmer is called an idiot.|
039660|345-en|en|wav/p345_031.wav|||It's an amazing landscape!|
039661|345-en|en|wav/p345_032.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
039662|345-en|en|wav/p345_033.wav|||It's a lot of pressure on me.|
039663|345-en|en|wav/p345_034.wav|||We had to laugh.|
039664|345-en|en|wav/p345_035.wav|||It is too pretty, it is too small.|
039665|345-en|en|wav/p345_036.wav|||We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|
039666|345-en|en|wav/p345_037.wav|||I was completely knackered.|
039667|345-en|en|wav/p345_038.wav|||I'd rather be singing Verdi.|
039668|345-en|en|wav/p345_039.wav|||A killer is also on the loose.|
039669|345-en|en|wav/p345_040.wav|||Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.|
039670|345-en|en|wav/p345_041.wav|||You've got to be vigilant.|
039671|345-en|en|wav/p345_042.wav|||You can see how he made his money.|
039672|345-en|en|wav/p345_043.wav|||However, there were some alarming findings.|
039673|345-en|en|wav/p345_044.wav|||Who wants to be a Millionaire?|
039674|345-en|en|wav/p345_045.wav|||We would certainly consider the proposals.|
039675|345-en|en|wav/p345_046.wav|||I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.|
039676|345-en|en|wav/p345_047.wav|||His record with England was not good.|
039677|345-en|en|wav/p345_048.wav|||The opposite is the case.|
039678|345-en|en|wav/p345_049.wav|||Who would be a referee?|
039679|345-en|en|wav/p345_050.wav|||Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.|
039680|345-en|en|wav/p345_051.wav|||It was time to act.|
039681|345-en|en|wav/p345_052.wav|||It's a question of fashion.|
039682|345-en|en|wav/p345_053.wav|||I could never be cool.|
039683|345-en|en|wav/p345_054.wav|||We will be paying agency rates.|
039684|345-en|en|wav/p345_055.wav|||Others said he had gone too far.|
039685|345-en|en|wav/p345_056.wav|||We expect them to deliver for us.|
039686|345-en|en|wav/p345_057.wav|||He was between people and God.|
039687|345-en|en|wav/p345_058.wav|||I've never seen anything like it.|
039688|345-en|en|wav/p345_059.wav|||They were willing us to get a second.|
039689|345-en|en|wav/p345_060.wav|||No casualties were reported.|
039690|345-en|en|wav/p345_061.wav|||The classes are taking place.|
039691|345-en|en|wav/p345_062.wav|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
039692|345-en|en|wav/p345_063.wav|||The sleeper was six hours late.|
039693|345-en|en|wav/p345_064.wav|||There will be no threat to the game.|
039694|345-en|en|wav/p345_065.wav|||It would be a last resort.|

039697|345-en|en|wav/p345_068.wav|||We were caught out.|
039698|345-en|en|wav/p345_069.wav|||It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|
039699|345-en|en|wav/p345_070.wav|||I haven't made any definite decisions.|
039700|345-en|en|wav/p345_071.wav|||I had to lie.|
039701|345-en|en|wav/p345_072.wav|||Among them is his beloved teacher.|
039702|345-en|en|wav/p345_073.wav|||Everyone was writing me off.|
039703|345-en|en|wav/p345_074.wav|||How do we get more people in?|
039704|345-en|en|wav/p345_075.wav|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
039705|345-en|en|wav/p345_076.wav|||But her parents will never see her again.|

039709|345-en|en|wav/p345_080.wav|||We should be capable of managing it, though.|
039710|345-en|en|wav/p345_081.wav|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
039711|345-en|en|wav/p345_082.wav|||It is a freedom.|
039712|345-en|en|wav/p345_083.wav|||What happens next?|
039713|345-en|en|wav/p345_084.wav|||All our futures will already have been decided.|
039714|345-en|en|wav/p345_085.wav|||I would have been shot dead in bed.|
039715|345-en|en|wav/p345_086.wav|||He insisted that his staff were too.|
039716|345-en|en|wav/p345_087.wav|||They should come clean.|
039717|345-en|en|wav/p345_088.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
039718|345-en|en|wav/p345_089.wav|||I believe that so strongly.|
039719|345-en|en|wav/p345_090.wav|||That, though, is an old story.|
039720|345-en|en|wav/p345_091.wav|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
039721|345-en|en|wav/p345_092.wav|||They don't work anymore anyway.|
039722|345-en|en|wav/p345_093.wav|||It's about time something was done about equipment.|
039723|345-en|en|wav/p345_094.wav|||It was a funny feeling.|
039724|345-en|en|wav/p345_095.wav|||He was at it again yesterday.|
039725|345-en|en|wav/p345_096.wav|||You can't go on forever.|
039726|345-en|en|wav/p345_097.wav|||So far this season this approach is working.|
039727|345-en|en|wav/p345_098.wav|||However, his involvement was instant.|
039728|345-en|en|wav/p345_099.wav|||It has to work.|
039729|345-en|en|wav/p345_100.wav|||It was, for me, like a week in heaven.|
039730|345-en|en|wav/p345_101.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
039731|345-en|en|wav/p345_102.wav|||There's something about being cut off.|
039732|345-en|en|wav/p345_103.wav|||This is his personal life.|
039733|345-en|en|wav/p345_104.wav|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
039734|345-en|en|wav/p345_105.wav|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
039735|345-en|en|wav/p345_106.wav|||It's as eventful as it is momentous.|
039736|345-en|en|wav/p345_107.wav|||I was going to help with the dinner.|
039737|345-en|en|wav/p345_108.wav|||Would you pay to come and see it?|
039738|345-en|en|wav/p345_109.wav|||What are they like?|
039739|345-en|en|wav/p345_110.wav|||I would probably have to agree with him.|
039740|345-en|en|wav/p345_111.wav|||They were back in favour with the SAC.|
039741|345-en|en|wav/p345_112.wav|||He had a moustache.|
039742|345-en|en|wav/p345_113.wav|||I have been thinking about that this week.|
039743|345-en|en|wav/p345_114.wav|||Let's get it on.|
039744|345-en|en|wav/p345_115.wav|||Together they will attempt to express the whole.|
039745|345-en|en|wav/p345_116.wav|||Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.|
039746|345-en|en|wav/p345_117.wav|||It is really good news.|
039747|345-en|en|wav/p345_118.wav|||We just want a fair deal.|
039748|345-en|en|wav/p345_119.wav|||I'll just have to live with that.|
039749|345-en|en|wav/p345_120.wav|||Neither of them was badly hurt.|
039750|345-en|en|wav/p345_121.wav|||He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.|
039751|345-en|en|wav/p345_122.wav|||We wanted it left for a wee while.|
039752|345-en|en|wav/p345_123.wav|||At the moment, the success in Germany is good.|
039753|345-en|en|wav/p345_124.wav|||It is sad and frustrating.|
039754|345-en|en|wav/p345_125.wav|||Our intentions are real.|
039755|345-en|en|wav/p345_126.wav|||The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.|
039756|345-en|en|wav/p345_127.wav|||Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.|
039757|345-en|en|wav/p345_128.wav|||She has left the island.|
039758|345-en|en|wav/p345_129.wav|||That will be the case on Tuesday.|
039759|345-en|en|wav/p345_130.wav|||As to rugby, well, no-one knows.|
039760|345-en|en|wav/p345_131.wav|||It certainly should not be used too often.|
039761|345-en|en|wav/p345_132.wav|||The whole matter is done and dusted.|
039762|345-en|en|wav/p345_133.wav|||I don't know where that one came from.|
039763|345-en|en|wav/p345_134.wav|||The shooting created panic in the street.|
039764|345-en|en|wav/p345_135.wav|||He would just say it was terrible.|
039765|345-en|en|wav/p345_136.wav|||Our destiny is in our own hands.|
039766|345-en|en|wav/p345_137.wav|||That's not fair to the supporters.|
039767|345-en|en|wav/p345_138.wav|||I was on my own.|
039768|345-en|en|wav/p345_139.wav|||They were part of our own family.|
039769|345-en|en|wav/p345_140.wav|||It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.|
039770|345-en|en|wav/p345_141.wav|||I don't have any perspective on it.|
039771|345-en|en|wav/p345_142.wav|||Scotland has lost a great man.|
039772|345-en|en|wav/p345_143.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
039773|345-en|en|wav/p345_144.wav|||In fact, they will not be disciplined.|
039774|345-en|en|wav/p345_145.wav|||His name has not been released.|
039775|345-en|en|wav/p345_146.wav|||For some, it was more painful than others.|
039776|345-en|en|wav/p345_147.wav|||It plainly does not work.|
039777|345-en|en|wav/p345_148.wav|||His words were not audible.|
039778|345-en|en|wav/p345_149.wav|||That's a huge amount.|
039779|345-en|en|wav/p345_150.wav|||See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.|
039780|345-en|en|wav/p345_151.wav|||It was even worse than at home.|
039781|345-en|en|wav/p345_152.wav|||I still think he will win.|
039782|345-en|en|wav/p345_153.wav|||But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|
039783|345-en|en|wav/p345_154.wav|||Normally it would be four minutes.|
039784|345-en|en|wav/p345_155.wav|||It may have been a cry for help.|
039785|345-en|en|wav/p345_156.wav|||But the damage had been done.|
039786|345-en|en|wav/p345_157.wav|||No, you couldn't make it up.|
039787|345-en|en|wav/p345_158.wav|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
039788|345-en|en|wav/p345_159.wav|||However, he did not stay there very long.|
039789|345-en|en|wav/p345_160.wav|||And so they have.|
039790|345-en|en|wav/p345_161.wav|||I have a great respect for her.|
039791|345-en|en|wav/p345_162.wav|||I suggest a new plan.|
039792|345-en|en|wav/p345_163.wav|||IT takes the biscuit.|
039793|345-en|en|wav/p345_164.wav|||But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|
039794|345-en|en|wav/p345_165.wav|||We don't have a solution to the problem.|
039795|345-en|en|wav/p345_166.wav|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
039796|345-en|en|wav/p345_167.wav|||The result is utterly compelling.|
039797|345-en|en|wav/p345_168.wav|||But it won't be the same.|
039798|345-en|en|wav/p345_169.wav|||Other forces were, however, at work.|
039799|345-en|en|wav/p345_170.wav|||Inspiring public confidence is crucial.|
039800|345-en|en|wav/p345_171.wav|||It is a hobby for me.|
039801|345-en|en|wav/p345_172.wav|||If only the acting profession was that simple.|
039802|345-en|en|wav/p345_173.wav|||It was like a kick in the belly.|
039803|345-en|en|wav/p345_174.wav|||Bombing is the easy option.|
039804|345-en|en|wav/p345_175.wav|||We should have gone solo.|
039805|345-en|en|wav/p345_176.wav|||Directing, if you like.|
039806|345-en|en|wav/p345_177.wav|||That will be the case.|
039807|345-en|en|wav/p345_178.wav|||Now, it's all right.|
039808|345-en|en|wav/p345_179.wav|||All will be revealed in due course.|
039809|345-en|en|wav/p345_180.wav|||They have known the hard times.|
039810|345-en|en|wav/p345_181.wav|||We don't know what happened.|
039811|345-en|en|wav/p345_182.wav|||You cannot enter the clubhouse.|
039812|345-en|en|wav/p345_183.wav|||They had seven children.|
039813|345-en|en|wav/p345_184.wav|||That in itself is an erotic experience.|
039814|345-en|en|wav/p345_185.wav|||Death is outside the language.|
039815|345-en|en|wav/p345_186.wav|||You have a plan?|
039816|345-en|en|wav/p345_187.wav|||It's all too early.|
039817|345-en|en|wav/p345_188.wav|||Everything in the world was focused on London.|
039818|345-en|en|wav/p345_189.wav|||We've seen that time and time again.|
039819|345-en|en|wav/p345_190.wav|||I was never alone with her, right?|
039820|345-en|en|wav/p345_191.wav|||It's not only my respect for them.|
039821|345-en|en|wav/p345_192.wav|||Tonight's matches European Championship.|
039822|345-en|en|wav/p345_193.wav|||This is a very high price.|
039823|345-en|en|wav/p345_194.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
039824|345-en|en|wav/p345_195.wav|||I never want to have any children.|
039825|345-en|en|wav/p345_196.wav|||Business has never been so bad.|
039826|345-en|en|wav/p345_197.wav|||There is no way to do this.|
039827|345-en|en|wav/p345_198.wav|||Edinburgh was not included in the survey.|
039828|345-en|en|wav/p345_199.wav|||I know my sons.|
039829|345-en|en|wav/p345_200.wav|||Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.|
039830|345-en|en|wav/p345_201.wav|||It was too close to call.|
039831|345-en|en|wav/p345_202.wav|||But who is the killer?|
039832|345-en|en|wav/p345_203.wav|||No, it's never been mentioned.|
039833|345-en|en|wav/p345_204.wav|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
039834|345-en|en|wav/p345_205.wav|||The devil, of course, will be in the detail.|
039835|345-en|en|wav/p345_206.wav|||Then another one came.|
039836|345-en|en|wav/p345_207.wav|||Progress is being made but it is slow.|
039837|345-en|en|wav/p345_208.wav|||Everything has been destroyed.|
039838|345-en|en|wav/p345_209.wav|||The Lobby is not failing.|
039839|345-en|en|wav/p345_210.wav|||But it is looking very positive.|
039840|345-en|en|wav/p345_211.wav|||Drugs are getting through.|
039841|345-en|en|wav/p345_212.wav|||He would have come into the house.|
039842|345-en|en|wav/p345_213.wav|||I want to put myself on discussion also.|
039843|345-en|en|wav/p345_214.wav|||It happens in real life.|
039844|345-en|en|wav/p345_215.wav|||At the time, he was a living legend.|
039845|345-en|en|wav/p345_216.wav|||And we will do it.|
039846|345-en|en|wav/p345_217.wav|||It's a human tragedy.|
039847|345-en|en|wav/p345_218.wav|||But we are losing that connection.|
039848|345-en|en|wav/p345_219.wav|||I am going to fight to the end.|
039849|345-en|en|wav/p345_220.wav|||Either group is living in fantasy land.|
039850|345-en|en|wav/p345_221.wav|||It's the right thing.|
039851|345-en|en|wav/p345_222.wav|||That was a disgraceful performance.|
039852|345-en|en|wav/p345_223.wav|||Must have been at the bar.|
039853|345-en|en|wav/p345_224.wav|||But this is just the start.|
039854|345-en|en|wav/p345_225.wav|||I can't get away from it.|
039855|345-en|en|wav/p345_226.wav|||I believe in the Union.|
039856|345-en|en|wav/p345_227.wav|||SCOTLAND has shown the way.|
039857|345-en|en|wav/p345_228.wav|||But he is not hopeful.|
039858|345-en|en|wav/p345_229.wav|||It will be all about the Olympics.|
039859|345-en|en|wav/p345_230.wav|||They are very frightened.|
039860|345-en|en|wav/p345_231.wav|||We have all been there at some point.|
039861|345-en|en|wav/p345_232.wav|||This is my homeland.|
039862|345-en|en|wav/p345_233.wav|||The game was up.|
039863|345-en|en|wav/p345_234.wav|||That is not an easy thing.|
039864|345-en|en|wav/p345_235.wav|||Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.|
039865|345-en|en|wav/p345_236.wav|||I didn't know where they were.|

039867|345-en|en|wav/p345_238.wav|||Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.|
039868|345-en|en|wav/p345_239.wav|||Three weeks later, he resigned.|
039869|345-en|en|wav/p345_240.wav|||There are two options.|
039870|345-en|en|wav/p345_241.wav|||I can't describe it.|
039871|345-en|en|wav/p345_242.wav|||Surely it should be the other way round.|
039872|345-en|en|wav/p345_243.wav|||There is a handful of rewarding paintings.|
039873|345-en|en|wav/p345_244.wav|||I get on him, he gets on me.|
039874|345-en|en|wav/p345_245.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
039875|345-en|en|wav/p345_246.wav|||I am appalled by this news.|
039876|345-en|en|wav/p345_247.wav|||No injuries were reported.|
039877|345-en|en|wav/p345_248.wav|||It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|
039878|345-en|en|wav/p345_249.wav|||It is understood he had been stabbed.|
039879|345-en|en|wav/p345_250.wav|||It's too much work.|
039880|345-en|en|wav/p345_251.wav|||We were extremely arrogant.|
039881|345-en|en|wav/p345_252.wav|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|
039882|345-en|en|wav/p345_253.wav|||THE waiting game continues.|
039883|345-en|en|wav/p345_254.wav|||Hospitals and school building will go ahead.|
039884|345-en|en|wav/p345_255.wav|||I don't think he was being very fair.|
039885|345-en|en|wav/p345_256.wav|||You've got to fight to stay up.|
039886|345-en|en|wav/p345_257.wav|||But the foundations have been laid.|
039887|345-en|en|wav/p345_258.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
039888|345-en|en|wav/p345_259.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
039889|345-en|en|wav/p345_260.wav|||What is so unusual about this case?|
039890|345-en|en|wav/p345_261.wav|||Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.|
039891|345-en|en|wav/p345_262.wav|||But this is different.|
039892|345-en|en|wav/p345_263.wav|||I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.|
039893|345-en|en|wav/p345_264.wav|||It doesn't look good.|
039894|345-en|en|wav/p345_265.wav|||That will not change.|
039895|345-en|en|wav/p345_267.wav|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
039896|345-en|en|wav/p345_268.wav|||Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.|
039897|345-en|en|wav/p345_269.wav|||It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.|
039898|345-en|en|wav/p345_270.wav|||There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.|
039899|345-en|en|wav/p345_271.wav|||They've been at it for five hours.|
039900|345-en|en|wav/p345_272.wav|||This action could have been avoided.|
039901|345-en|en|wav/p345_273.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
039902|345-en|en|wav/p345_274.wav|||And they still have the final to come.|
039903|345-en|en|wav/p345_275.wav|||Anyone else can apply.|
039904|345-en|en|wav/p345_276.wav|||He looked like a schoolboy.|
039905|345-en|en|wav/p345_277.wav|||It was like the old days.|
039906|345-en|en|wav/p345_278.wav|||But that is about to change.|
039907|345-en|en|wav/p345_279.wav|||The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.|
039908|345-en|en|wav/p345_280.wav|||We can build on that.|
039909|345-en|en|wav/p345_281.wav|||It could be a danger.|
039910|345-en|en|wav/p345_282.wav|||We are not going to be complacent.|
039911|345-en|en|wav/p345_283.wav|||The only problem was, they were on himself.|
039912|345-en|en|wav/p345_284.wav|||His body was found in May.|
039913|345-en|en|wav/p345_285.wav|||He's a joy to follow.|
039914|345-en|en|wav/p345_286.wav|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?|
039915|345-en|en|wav/p345_287.wav|||I'm sure you all can relate to that.|
039916|345-en|en|wav/p345_288.wav|||My wife is coming over at the weekend.|
039917|345-en|en|wav/p345_289.wav|||Sure, he is the best player in the world.|
039918|345-en|en|wav/p345_290.wav|||It starts to get you down.|
039919|345-en|en|wav/p345_291.wav|||I don't think we could have expected better.|
039920|345-en|en|wav/p345_292.wav|||My life has been turned upside down.|
039921|345-en|en|wav/p345_293.wav|||Somebody has to speak up for common sense.|
039922|345-en|en|wav/p345_294.wav|||But they miss the whole point.|
039923|345-en|en|wav/p345_295.wav|||You have to count on other people.|
039924|345-en|en|wav/p345_296.wav|||I said, What was that about?|
039925|345-en|en|wav/p345_297.wav|||Immediate action must be taken.|
039926|345-en|en|wav/p345_298.wav|||This could prove a problem.|
039927|345-en|en|wav/p345_299.wav|||I was a local hero.|
039928|345-en|en|wav/p345_300.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
039929|345-en|en|wav/p345_301.wav|||It will be extremely difficult for him.|
039930|345-en|en|wav/p345_302.wav|||It's a gigantic con.|
039931|345-en|en|wav/p345_303.wav|||Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.|
039932|345-en|en|wav/p345_304.wav|||This club have been fair to me.|
039933|345-en|en|wav/p345_305.wav|||I didn't know she could do that.|
039934|345-en|en|wav/p345_306.wav|||What does she consider her greatest achievement?|
039935|345-en|en|wav/p345_307.wav|||This is too much like Scotland.|
039936|345-en|en|wav/p345_308.wav|||I can't say anything about any figure.|
039937|345-en|en|wav/p345_309.wav|||A counter reaction was.|
039938|345-en|en|wav/p345_310.wav|||That goes back a long way.|
039939|345-en|en|wav/p345_311.wav|||I wouldn't have had the abandon.|
039940|345-en|en|wav/p345_312.wav|||She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.|
039941|345-en|en|wav/p345_313.wav|||They were not missing much.|
039942|345-en|en|wav/p345_314.wav|||It should not make the same mistake again.|
039943|345-en|en|wav/p345_315.wav|||Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.|
039944|345-en|en|wav/p345_316.wav|||The record companies have gone through the floor.|
039945|345-en|en|wav/p345_317.wav|||It's always a dilemma.|
039946|345-en|en|wav/p345_318.wav|||As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.|
039947|345-en|en|wav/p345_319.wav|||Is she in trouble?|
039948|345-en|en|wav/p345_320.wav|||It is a symbolic concert.|
039949|345-en|en|wav/p345_321.wav|||They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.|
039950|345-en|en|wav/p345_322.wav|||It is a very beautiful city.|
039951|345-en|en|wav/p345_323.wav|||She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.|
039952|345-en|en|wav/p345_324.wav|||But could it afford to run it?|
039953|345-en|en|wav/p345_325.wav|||I am very happy with him.|
039954|345-en|en|wav/p345_326.wav|||I was waiting for that question.|
039955|345-en|en|wav/p345_327.wav|||Her body was found on Monday morning.|
039956|345-en|en|wav/p345_328.wav|||I am not against a further inquiry.|
039957|345-en|en|wav/p345_329.wav|||His father said, My son was lucky.|
039958|345-en|en|wav/p345_330.wav|||WHO would have thought it?|
039959|345-en|en|wav/p345_331.wav|||We will win the argument.|
039960|345-en|en|wav/p345_332.wav|||Five years later, the deception continued.|
039961|345-en|en|wav/p345_333.wav|||I might get an injury very easily.|
039962|345-en|en|wav/p345_334.wav|||I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.|
039963|345-en|en|wav/p345_335.wav|||Stock markets will be watching closely.|
039964|345-en|en|wav/p345_336.wav|||I just want to do the good work.|
039965|345-en|en|wav/p345_337.wav|||I'm very happy tonight.|
039966|345-en|en|wav/p345_338.wav|||He was overwhelmed by the response.|
039967|345-en|en|wav/p345_339.wav|||Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.|
039968|345-en|en|wav/p345_340.wav|||Now it was serious.|
039969|345-en|en|wav/p345_341.wav|||This is his first movie.|
039970|345-en|en|wav/p345_342.wav|||He is already in place.|
039971|345-en|en|wav/p345_343.wav|||No one would believe him.|
039972|345-en|en|wav/p345_344.wav|||We live in shorthand.|
039973|345-en|en|wav/p345_345.wav|||But something has been lost in the translation.|
039974|345-en|en|wav/p345_346.wav|||Spent three months alone at sea.|
039975|345-en|en|wav/p345_347.wav|||I made a big mistake.|
039976|345-en|en|wav/p345_348.wav|||I just know it's a lot.|
039977|345-en|en|wav/p345_349.wav|||I saw one body.|
039978|345-en|en|wav/p345_350.wav|||I am very happy.|
039979|345-en|en|wav/p345_351.wav|||There was no discussion about it.|
039980|345-en|en|wav/p345_352.wav|||Three hours later, the man was free.|
039981|345-en|en|wav/p345_353.wav|||It was a very big win for us.|
039982|345-en|en|wav/p345_354.wav|||I've never felt affection for Emu.|
039983|345-en|en|wav/p345_355.wav|||Everything is up for grabs.|
039984|345-en|en|wav/p345_356.wav|||We had a good time.|
039985|345-en|en|wav/p345_357.wav|||I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.|
039986|345-en|en|wav/p345_358.wav|||This was a good performance.|
039987|345-en|en|wav/p345_359.wav|||However, the snow was welcomed by some.|
039988|345-en|en|wav/p345_360.wav|||It is not simple.|
039989|345-en|en|wav/p345_361.wav|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
039990|345-en|en|wav/p345_362.wav|||Our task is to complete the picture.|
039991|345-en|en|wav/p345_363.wav|||It is a road of death.|
039992|345-en|en|wav/p345_364.wav|||The Government would be ready, they said.|
039993|345-en|en|wav/p345_365.wav|||Her life is now back on track.|
039994|345-en|en|wav/p345_366.wav|||I said at the time it was wrong.|
039995|345-en|en|wav/p345_367.wav|||By now he was very ill with cancer.|
039996|345-en|en|wav/p345_368.wav|||Anything that was going, really.|
039997|345-en|en|wav/p345_369.wav|||He will take it in his stride.|
039998|345-en|en|wav/p345_370.wav|||I don't believe a word of it.|
039999|345-en|en|wav/p345_371.wav|||I couldn't put my finger on it.|
040000|345-en|en|wav/p345_372.wav|||People can really get themselves in a mess.|
040001|345-en|en|wav/p345_373.wav|||The winner will be announced in December.|
040002|345-en|en|wav/p345_374.wav|||This is bound to happen.|
040003|345-en|en|wav/p345_375.wav|||Suddenly, there was an audience.|
040004|345-en|en|wav/p345_376.wav|||It has not yet opened to pupils.|
040005|345-en|en|wav/p345_377.wav|||The letters are going out today.|
040006|345-en|en|wav/p345_378.wav|||I did not name it.|
040007|345-en|en|wav/p345_379.wav|||And therein lies the problem.|
040008|345-en|en|wav/p345_380.wav|||I also thought, This is a feature film.|
040009|345-en|en|wav/p345_381.wav|||McMaster had already seen the first part.|
040010|345-en|en|wav/p345_382.wav|||Or is it?|
040011|345-en|en|wav/p345_383.wav|||Is he going to look after them?|
040012|345-en|en|wav/p345_384.wav|||They are appealing for witnesses.|
040013|345-en|en|wav/p345_385.wav|||This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.|
040014|345-en|en|wav/p345_386.wav|||It is quite simple.|
040015|345-en|en|wav/p345_389.wav|||It does affect the staff and the prisoners.|
040016|345-en|en|wav/p345_390.wav|||His instructions were clear.|
040017|345-en|en|wav/p345_391.wav|||There is ample evidence.|
040018|345-en|en|wav/p345_392.wav|||It was a game we had to win.|
040019|345-en|en|wav/p345_393.wav|||I've never had problems with any football managers.|
040020|345-en|en|wav/p345_394.wav|||To begin with it looks good.|
040021|345-en|en|wav/p345_395.wav|||I won't go back to Holland.|
040022|345-en|en|wav/p345_396.wav|||There is still a long way to go.|
040023|345-en|en|wav/p345_397.wav|||Almost overnight, he found his voice.|
040024|345-en|en|wav/p345_398.wav|||This was a unique election.|
040025|345-en|en|wav/p345_399.wav|||It was still there last night.|
040026|345-en|en|wav/p345_400.wav|||In his absence, the council adopted the change.|
040027|347-en|en|wav/p347_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
040028|347-en|en|wav/p347_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040029|347-en|en|wav/p347_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040030|347-en|en|wav/p347_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040031|347-en|en|wav/p347_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040032|347-en|en|wav/p347_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040033|347-en|en|wav/p347_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040034|347-en|en|wav/p347_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040035|347-en|en|wav/p347_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040036|347-en|en|wav/p347_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040037|347-en|en|wav/p347_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040038|347-en|en|wav/p347_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040039|347-en|en|wav/p347_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040040|347-en|en|wav/p347_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040041|347-en|en|wav/p347_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040042|347-en|en|wav/p347_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040043|347-en|en|wav/p347_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040044|347-en|en|wav/p347_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040045|347-en|en|wav/p347_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|

040254|347-en|en|wav/p347_229.wav|||It is time for a more honest approach.|
040255|347-en|en|wav/p347_230.wav|||That's the National Grid.|
040256|347-en|en|wav/p347_231.wav|||That is very, very bad news for our nation.|
040257|347-en|en|wav/p347_232.wav|||Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.|
040258|347-en|en|wav/p347_233.wav|||It is a big time for me.|
040259|347-en|en|wav/p347_234.wav|||There were two things going on at once.|
040260|347-en|en|wav/p347_235.wav|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
040261|347-en|en|wav/p347_236.wav|||It is a cause for concern.|
040262|347-en|en|wav/p347_237.wav|||Stalkers are capable of killing.|
040263|347-en|en|wav/p347_238.wav|||That is the key message.|
040264|347-en|en|wav/p347_239.wav|||It ignores the future.|
040265|347-en|en|wav/p347_240.wav|||This is the subway.|
040266|347-en|en|wav/p347_241.wav|||Altman has every right to be bitter.|
040267|347-en|en|wav/p347_242.wav|||What's the rush?|
040268|347-en|en|wav/p347_243.wav|||Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.|
040269|347-en|en|wav/p347_244.wav|||He's in with the furniture.|
040270|347-en|en|wav/p347_245.wav|||Do not go into government buildings.|
040271|347-en|en|wav/p347_246.wav|||There is only one caveat.|
040272|347-en|en|wav/p347_247.wav|||We are still getting signals.|
040273|347-en|en|wav/p347_248.wav|||What's it got to do with them, anyway?|
040274|347-en|en|wav/p347_249.wav|||I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|
040275|347-en|en|wav/p347_250.wav|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
040276|347-en|en|wav/p347_251.wav|||Everyone can be bought.|
040277|347-en|en|wav/p347_252.wav|||There are a few changes.|
040278|347-en|en|wav/p347_253.wav|||You're not going to get hurt.|
040279|347-en|en|wav/p347_254.wav|||THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|
040280|347-en|en|wav/p347_255.wav|||The New Deal will constantly be improved.|
040281|347-en|en|wav/p347_256.wav|||THE headless man has finally developed a face.|
040282|347-en|en|wav/p347_257.wav|||I heard some of his remarks.|
040283|347-en|en|wav/p347_258.wav|||I am a little bit tired.|
040284|347-en|en|wav/p347_259.wav|||Staff should be paid for what they produce.|
040285|347-en|en|wav/p347_260.wav|||I was just overwhelmed.|
040286|347-en|en|wav/p347_261.wav|||It had been in place since last July.|
040287|347-en|en|wav/p347_262.wav|||I have just got to get back.|
040288|347-en|en|wav/p347_263.wav|||In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.|
040289|347-en|en|wav/p347_264.wav|||Players want to know what is on offer.|
040290|347-en|en|wav/p347_265.wav|||Well, when did he ever refuse?|
040291|347-en|en|wav/p347_266.wav|||We will have to see, but it makes you think.|
040292|347-en|en|wav/p347_267.wav|||I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.|
040293|347-en|en|wav/p347_268.wav|||The singer's condition was not specified.|
040294|347-en|en|wav/p347_269.wav|||How much of a cop out is that?|
040295|347-en|en|wav/p347_270.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
040296|347-en|en|wav/p347_271.wav|||It was a journey into a new life.|
040297|347-en|en|wav/p347_272.wav|||It will be the final push.|
040298|347-en|en|wav/p347_273.wav|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
040299|347-en|en|wav/p347_274.wav|||You were the kidnappers.|
040300|347-en|en|wav/p347_275.wav|||It is a very interesting subject.|
040301|347-en|en|wav/p347_276.wav|||Arguably, they have already done it.|
040302|347-en|en|wav/p347_277.wav|||She had been in Germany for medical treatment.|
040303|347-en|en|wav/p347_278.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
040304|347-en|en|wav/p347_279.wav|||The women were on their way home yesterday.|
040305|347-en|en|wav/p347_280.wav|||I could feel the blood on my face.|
040306|347-en|en|wav/p347_281.wav|||I am a committed European.|
040307|347-en|en|wav/p347_282.wav|||There are no plans to change this.|
040308|347-en|en|wav/p347_283.wav|||The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.|
040309|347-en|en|wav/p347_284.wav|||It's in the eyes.|
040310|347-en|en|wav/p347_285.wav|||Working with him is like working with myself.|
040311|347-en|en|wav/p347_286.wav|||It is just too long since the war.|
040312|347-en|en|wav/p347_287.wav|||She didn't tell us anything new.|
040313|347-en|en|wav/p347_288.wav|||I mean it happens.|
040314|347-en|en|wav/p347_289.wav|||My wife is totally behind me on this.|
040315|347-en|en|wav/p347_290.wav|||Debbie Harry was cool.|
040316|347-en|en|wav/p347_291.wav|||Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.|
040317|347-en|en|wav/p347_292.wav|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
040318|347-en|en|wav/p347_293.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
040319|347-en|en|wav/p347_294.wav|||Six months later, they returned to Scotland.|
040320|347-en|en|wav/p347_295.wav|||It is typical of me.|
040321|347-en|en|wav/p347_296.wav|||Raised the way you want it.|
040322|347-en|en|wav/p347_297.wav|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
040323|347-en|en|wav/p347_298.wav|||I know you went back this morning.|
040324|347-en|en|wav/p347_299.wav|||They played it like a cup final.|
040325|347-en|en|wav/p347_300.wav|||This has a number of benefits.|
040326|347-en|en|wav/p347_301.wav|||I will carry on.|
040327|347-en|en|wav/p347_302.wav|||I think it is a great shame.|
040328|347-en|en|wav/p347_303.wav|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
040329|347-en|en|wav/p347_304.wav|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
040330|347-en|en|wav/p347_305.wav|||The chief constable is right.|
040331|347-en|en|wav/p347_306.wav|||And we were right.|
040332|347-en|en|wav/p347_307.wav|||That is where the club has gone wrong.|
040333|347-en|en|wav/p347_308.wav|||A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.|
040334|347-en|en|wav/p347_309.wav|||Surely it can do better than that?|
040335|347-en|en|wav/p347_310.wav|||It's my favourite place to hang out.|
040336|347-en|en|wav/p347_311.wav|||I think that could work to our advantage.|
040337|347-en|en|wav/p347_312.wav|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
040338|347-en|en|wav/p347_313.wav|||Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|
040339|347-en|en|wav/p347_314.wav|||He will make an excellent chief inspector.|
040340|347-en|en|wav/p347_315.wav|||We hope this scheme will change that.|
040341|347-en|en|wav/p347_316.wav|||I cannot confirm the name of any driver.|
040342|347-en|en|wav/p347_317.wav|||The red card was okay.|
040343|347-en|en|wav/p347_318.wav|||The Government has to grasp the nettle.|
040344|347-en|en|wav/p347_319.wav|||Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.|
040345|347-en|en|wav/p347_320.wav|||I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|
040346|347-en|en|wav/p347_321.wav|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
040347|347-en|en|wav/p347_322.wav|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
040348|347-en|en|wav/p347_323.wav|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|
040349|347-en|en|wav/p347_324.wav|||This is my music.|
040350|347-en|en|wav/p347_325.wav|||I haven't won the world title.|
040351|347-en|en|wav/p347_326.wav|||After his birthday, Scott was very upset.|
040352|347-en|en|wav/p347_327.wav|||It's fantastic to have finally won.|
040353|347-en|en|wav/p347_328.wav|||But she's also beautiful behind the face.|
040354|347-en|en|wav/p347_329.wav|||There is no date on this document.|
040355|347-en|en|wav/p347_330.wav|||And now he tells us.|
040356|347-en|en|wav/p347_331.wav|||I am not changing my event.|
040357|347-en|en|wav/p347_332.wav|||I know nothing about that.|
040358|347-en|en|wav/p347_333.wav|||Ferguson did not hesitate.|
040359|347-en|en|wav/p347_334.wav|||That is as it may be.|
040360|347-en|en|wav/p347_335.wav|||They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.|
040361|347-en|en|wav/p347_336.wav|||This is the start of a new campaign.|
040362|347-en|en|wav/p347_337.wav|||Eleven events are required.|
040363|347-en|en|wav/p347_338.wav|||It should have a health warning - it is addictive.|
040364|347-en|en|wav/p347_339.wav|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
040365|347-en|en|wav/p347_340.wav|||The winner will be announced by early summer.|
040366|347-en|en|wav/p347_341.wav|||I always said No.|
040367|347-en|en|wav/p347_342.wav|||Britain is a peaceful nation.|
040368|347-en|en|wav/p347_343.wav|||Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.|
040369|347-en|en|wav/p347_344.wav|||It is very much a matter for them.|
040370|347-en|en|wav/p347_345.wav|||Our future was his future.|
040371|347-en|en|wav/p347_346.wav|||His name is Michael Owen.|
040372|347-en|en|wav/p347_347.wav|||It has made a difference.|
040373|347-en|en|wav/p347_348.wav|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
040374|347-en|en|wav/p347_349.wav|||Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.|
040375|347-en|en|wav/p347_350.wav|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
040376|347-en|en|wav/p347_351.wav|||So now you know.|
040377|347-en|en|wav/p347_352.wav|||But, at the same time, they made you think about life.|
040378|347-en|en|wav/p347_353.wav|||It's a very special unit.|
040379|347-en|en|wav/p347_354.wav|||We will learn lessons from what has happened.|
040380|347-en|en|wav/p347_355.wav|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|
040381|347-en|en|wav/p347_356.wav|||Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
040382|347-en|en|wav/p347_357.wav|||By social devices, the two groups are coming together.|
040383|347-en|en|wav/p347_358.wav|||Smith has not let him down.|
040384|347-en|en|wav/p347_359.wav|||Which he can do.|
040385|347-en|en|wav/p347_360.wav|||No, it's actually in a block of flats.|
040386|347-en|en|wav/p347_361.wav|||They were that poor.|
040387|347-en|en|wav/p347_362.wav|||And we're talking Big Money.|
040388|347-en|en|wav/p347_363.wav|||His silence on the issue is interesting.|
040389|347-en|en|wav/p347_364.wav|||I was a little surprised.|
040390|347-en|en|wav/p347_365.wav|||It was a bit like having children.|
040391|347-en|en|wav/p347_366.wav|||With Pierre, you can never be sure.|
040392|347-en|en|wav/p347_367.wav|||They believed it worked.|
040393|347-en|en|wav/p347_368.wav|||I'm really proud of my young players.|
040394|347-en|en|wav/p347_369.wav|||As it happened, it was much more than that.|
040395|347-en|en|wav/p347_370.wav|||It's an internal matter.|
040396|347-en|en|wav/p347_371.wav|||They should feel ashamed.|
040397|347-en|en|wav/p347_372.wav|||You realise what this means?|
040398|347-en|en|wav/p347_373.wav|||We're delighted about the vote.|
040399|347-en|en|wav/p347_374.wav|||They were only there for three weeks.|
040400|347-en|en|wav/p347_375.wav|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
040401|347-en|en|wav/p347_376.wav|||Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.|
040402|347-en|en|wav/p347_377.wav|||It is just completely erased.|
040403|347-en|en|wav/p347_378.wav|||To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.|
040404|347-en|en|wav/p347_379.wav|||It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.|
040405|347-en|en|wav/p347_380.wav|||It's not just for classical music.|
040406|347-en|en|wav/p347_381.wav|||This must be kept in total perspective.|
040407|347-en|en|wav/p347_382.wav|||Election results are expected soon.|
040408|347-en|en|wav/p347_383.wav|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
040409|347-en|en|wav/p347_384.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
040410|347-en|en|wav/p347_385.wav|||They didn't find anything.|
040411|347-en|en|wav/p347_386.wav|||Is that where we are?|
040412|347-en|en|wav/p347_387.wav|||We used to keep our business rates.|
040413|347-en|en|wav/p347_388.wav|||It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|
040414|347-en|en|wav/p347_389.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
040415|347-en|en|wav/p347_390.wav|||But there's no eye contact.|
040416|347-en|en|wav/p347_391.wav|||There was no energy behind it.|
040417|347-en|en|wav/p347_392.wav|||They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|
040418|347-en|en|wav/p347_393.wav|||Even for a British Open, this is different.|
040419|347-en|en|wav/p347_394.wav|||I took a minibus into town.|
040420|347-en|en|wav/p347_395.wav|||They have not allowed them to defend themselves.|
040421|347-en|en|wav/p347_396.wav|||Completion is expected by October the following year.|
040422|347-en|en|wav/p347_397.wav|||It is not a wish list.|
040423|347-en|en|wav/p347_398.wav|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
040424|347-en|en|wav/p347_399.wav|||They were both very brave.|
040425|347-en|en|wav/p347_400.wav|||There is no margin for error.|
040426|347-en|en|wav/p347_401.wav|||Why should we even be asked to share?|
040427|347-en|en|wav/p347_402.wav|||It was not a foul.|
040428|347-en|en|wav/p347_403.wav|||I get very excited by that.|
040429|347-en|en|wav/p347_404.wav|||The members have clearly spoken.|
040430|347-en|en|wav/p347_405.wav|||In the end, it will mean an awful lot.|
040431|347-en|en|wav/p347_406.wav|||I believe in God.|
040432|347-en|en|wav/p347_407.wav|||Which means it matters.|
040433|347-en|en|wav/p347_408.wav|||There is great potential on this river.|
040434|347-en|en|wav/p347_409.wav|||We can't win a big game.|
040435|347-en|en|wav/p347_410.wav|||It was a stunning strike.|
040436|347-en|en|wav/p347_411.wav|||This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|
040437|347-en|en|wav/p347_412.wav|||She said he showed no remorse.|
040438|347-en|en|wav/p347_413.wav|||We are going through difficult times.|
040439|347-en|en|wav/p347_414.wav|||There can be no compromise on that demand.|
040440|347-en|en|wav/p347_415.wav|||What exactly is your job?|
040441|347-en|en|wav/p347_416.wav|||However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|
040442|347-en|en|wav/p347_417.wav|||There's nothing for you here.|
040443|347-en|en|wav/p347_418.wav|||I grew up listening to these people.|
040444|347-en|en|wav/p347_419.wav|||They wanted to show what they could do.|
040445|347-en|en|wav/p347_420.wav|||I just want to get rid of it.|
040446|347-en|en|wav/p347_421.wav|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
040447|347-en|en|wav/p347_422.wav|||It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|
040448|347-en|en|wav/p347_423.wav|||I have not come in to take over.|
040449|347-en|en|wav/p347_424.wav|||Is this accurate?|
040450|351-en|en|wav/p351_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
040451|351-en|en|wav/p351_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040452|351-en|en|wav/p351_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040453|351-en|en|wav/p351_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040454|351-en|en|wav/p351_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040455|351-en|en|wav/p351_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040456|351-en|en|wav/p351_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040457|351-en|en|wav/p351_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040458|351-en|en|wav/p351_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040459|351-en|en|wav/p351_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040460|351-en|en|wav/p351_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040461|351-en|en|wav/p351_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040462|351-en|en|wav/p351_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040463|351-en|en|wav/p351_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040464|351-en|en|wav/p351_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040465|351-en|en|wav/p351_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040466|351-en|en|wav/p351_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040467|351-en|en|wav/p351_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040468|351-en|en|wav/p351_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040469|351-en|en|wav/p351_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040470|351-en|en|wav/p351_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040471|351-en|en|wav/p351_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040472|351-en|en|wav/p351_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040473|351-en|en|wav/p351_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040474|351-en|en|wav/p351_025.wav|||It was by the numbers.|
040475|351-en|en|wav/p351_026.wav|||I don't think they can complain about that.|

040496|351-en|en|wav/p351_047.wav|||We know we can defend it.|
040497|351-en|en|wav/p351_048.wav|||That is not the case.|
040498|351-en|en|wav/p351_049.wav|||He met his wife and married in England.|
040499|351-en|en|wav/p351_050.wav|||Instead we were shot in the back.|

040506|351-en|en|wav/p351_057.wav|||Now it has become a big picture.|
040507|351-en|en|wav/p351_058.wav|||The jury is still out.|
040508|351-en|en|wav/p351_059.wav|||Hopefully, they will not go through with it.|

040574|351-en|en|wav/p351_126.wav|||In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.|
040575|351-en|en|wav/p351_127.wav|||The truth, of course, is very different.|
040576|351-en|en|wav/p351_128.wav|||He has something in common with the Wallabies.|
040577|351-en|en|wav/p351_129.wav|||These will take a little time to develop.|

040580|351-en|en|wav/p351_132.wav|||But, still, it wasn't working.|
040581|351-en|en|wav/p351_133.wav|||That was my mistake.|
040582|351-en|en|wav/p351_134.wav|||We can play better than that.|

040624|351-en|en|wav/p351_176.wav|||I think we're going to make it.|
040625|351-en|en|wav/p351_177.wav|||It was really frustrating.|

040658|351-en|en|wav/p351_210.wav|||If only the problems concerned the players.|
040659|351-en|en|wav/p351_211.wav|||But it was money well spent.|
040660|351-en|en|wav/p351_212.wav|||That's the most important thing for me.|
040661|351-en|en|wav/p351_213.wav|||At the end of the day, one has to be careful.|
040662|351-en|en|wav/p351_214.wav|||No decision has yet been made.|
040663|351-en|en|wav/p351_215.wav|||I have had a lovely summer.|
040664|351-en|en|wav/p351_216.wav|||Which is fair enough.|
040665|351-en|en|wav/p351_217.wav|||He took over our lives.|
040666|351-en|en|wav/p351_218.wav|||The problem is worse in Scotland.|
040667|351-en|en|wav/p351_219.wav|||This is a historic agreement.|
040668|351-en|en|wav/p351_220.wav|||He had worked there for only two days.|
040669|351-en|en|wav/p351_221.wav|||We just want them home.|
040670|351-en|en|wav/p351_222.wav|||His was the best performance of the day, after all.|
040671|351-en|en|wav/p351_223.wav|||I was happily surprised.|
040672|351-en|en|wav/p351_224.wav|||It may not even be possible.|
040673|351-en|en|wav/p351_225.wav|||I think it is a scandal.|
040674|351-en|en|wav/p351_226.wav|||Perhaps it was just as well.|
040675|351-en|en|wav/p351_227.wav|||That, though, was then.|
040676|351-en|en|wav/p351_228.wav|||I grew up with them.|
040677|351-en|en|wav/p351_229.wav|||It was the train coming.|
040678|351-en|en|wav/p351_230.wav|||I would have the hammer in the crowd.|
040679|351-en|en|wav/p351_231.wav|||We are pursuing legal action against the government.|
040680|351-en|en|wav/p351_232.wav|||Perhaps that was their mistake.|
040681|351-en|en|wav/p351_233.wav|||We've never seen so many.|
040682|351-en|en|wav/p351_234.wav|||The way forward is working with other disciplines.|
040683|351-en|en|wav/p351_235.wav|||I am very, very happy.|
040684|351-en|en|wav/p351_236.wav|||The case was continued.|
040685|351-en|en|wav/p351_237.wav|||That is important for the club.|
040686|351-en|en|wav/p351_238.wav|||He is doing the right things.|
040687|351-en|en|wav/p351_239.wav|||Blood samples were taken.|
040688|351-en|en|wav/p351_240.wav|||Now he is in charge of this.|
040689|351-en|en|wav/p351_241.wav|||They want to play in the World Cup.|
040690|351-en|en|wav/p351_242.wav|||He was embarrassed about what he did.|
040691|351-en|en|wav/p351_243.wav|||This is excellent news for the workforce.|
040692|351-en|en|wav/p351_244.wav|||The home team also had their moments.|
040693|351-en|en|wav/p351_245.wav|||Haven't been so lucky since.|
040694|351-en|en|wav/p351_246.wav|||He is under no illusions.|
040695|351-en|en|wav/p351_247.wav|||It got no better.|
040696|351-en|en|wav/p351_248.wav|||Some were close to tears.|
040697|351-en|en|wav/p351_249.wav|||It has become a way of life.|
040698|351-en|en|wav/p351_250.wav|||They seem to turn up for them.|
040699|351-en|en|wav/p351_251.wav|||That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.|
040700|351-en|en|wav/p351_252.wav|||Now we are back on top of Europe.|
040701|351-en|en|wav/p351_253.wav|||Now the show is for public consumption.|
040702|351-en|en|wav/p351_254.wav|||I want to create events.|
040703|351-en|en|wav/p351_255.wav|||I wish it wasn't so, but it is.|
040704|351-en|en|wav/p351_256.wav|||The old manager, he didn't like me.|
040705|351-en|en|wav/p351_257.wav|||We had a court hearing in London yesterday.|
040706|351-en|en|wav/p351_258.wav|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
040707|351-en|en|wav/p351_259.wav|||It was like being in prison.|
040708|351-en|en|wav/p351_260.wav|||I think it was his parents.|
040709|351-en|en|wav/p351_261.wav|||That is very important to people.|
040710|351-en|en|wav/p351_262.wav|||I certainly hope not.|
040711|351-en|en|wav/p351_263.wav|||This is a dream come true for me.|
040712|351-en|en|wav/p351_264.wav|||No other country has ever won this tournament.|
040713|351-en|en|wav/p351_265.wav|||There he goes again.|
040714|351-en|en|wav/p351_266.wav|||However, there could be more bad weather to come.|
040715|351-en|en|wav/p351_267.wav|||I feel pretty good.|
040716|351-en|en|wav/p351_268.wav|||It's got to come from me.|
040717|351-en|en|wav/p351_269.wav|||There were moments of humour too.|
040718|351-en|en|wav/p351_270.wav|||He has a wealth of experience.|
040719|351-en|en|wav/p351_271.wav|||Don't you think it was a fine performance?|
040720|351-en|en|wav/p351_272.wav|||It happens from time to time.|
040721|351-en|en|wav/p351_273.wav|||All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.|
040722|351-en|en|wav/p351_274.wav|||They were too hard.|
040723|351-en|en|wav/p351_275.wav|||This is not a message from ministers.|
040724|351-en|en|wav/p351_276.wav|||We have been very patient.|
040725|351-en|en|wav/p351_277.wav|||I don't take that view.|
040726|351-en|en|wav/p351_278.wav|||They have a car and cannot afford another.|
040727|351-en|en|wav/p351_279.wav|||My only concern is for my children.|
040728|351-en|en|wav/p351_280.wav|||This is welcome news.|
040729|351-en|en|wav/p351_281.wav|||The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.|
040730|351-en|en|wav/p351_282.wav|||We just wish they had done so before.|
040731|351-en|en|wav/p351_283.wav|||It was a virus.|
040732|351-en|en|wav/p351_284.wav|||The rest, of course, is history.|
040733|351-en|en|wav/p351_285.wav|||They chose the latter.|
040734|351-en|en|wav/p351_286.wav|||That was not the norm.|
040735|351-en|en|wav/p351_287.wav|||I've not said anything to them, they know.|
040736|351-en|en|wav/p351_288.wav|||It is giving out the wrong message.|
040737|351-en|en|wav/p351_289.wav|||I feel it is very irrational.|
040738|351-en|en|wav/p351_290.wav|||We were used to being in control.|
040739|351-en|en|wav/p351_291.wav|||He's had a lot of injury problems.|
040740|351-en|en|wav/p351_292.wav|||Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.|
040741|351-en|en|wav/p351_293.wav|||It happened again, and again, and again.|
040742|351-en|en|wav/p351_294.wav|||Does it matter?|
040743|351-en|en|wav/p351_295.wav|||She thought she was going to die.|
040744|351-en|en|wav/p351_296.wav|||Were they under-age?|
040745|351-en|en|wav/p351_297.wav|||You are going to go to jail.|
040746|351-en|en|wav/p351_298.wav|||It is a very worrying report.|
040747|351-en|en|wav/p351_299.wav|||I started it, but then forgot all about it.|
040748|351-en|en|wav/p351_300.wav|||My mind was made up.|
040749|351-en|en|wav/p351_301.wav|||It was an ongoing exercise.|
040750|351-en|en|wav/p351_302.wav|||I would love to see it back there.|
040751|351-en|en|wav/p351_303.wav|||He then did just that.|
040752|351-en|en|wav/p351_304.wav|||He should have won.|
040753|351-en|en|wav/p351_305.wav|||He could hardly have been in greater demand.|
040754|351-en|en|wav/p351_306.wav|||Who can predict?|
040755|351-en|en|wav/p351_307.wav|||It was all very proper and civilised.|
040756|351-en|en|wav/p351_308.wav|||I've played them all in the Champions League.|
040757|351-en|en|wav/p351_309.wav|||Then you see it.|
040758|351-en|en|wav/p351_310.wav|||And it had been a marvellous occasion.|
040759|351-en|en|wav/p351_311.wav|||We don't believe anything anymore.|
040760|351-en|en|wav/p351_312.wav|||Either system could have prevented the crash.|
040761|351-en|en|wav/p351_313.wav|||Here, the fans have been fantastic.|
040762|351-en|en|wav/p351_314.wav|||There is good quality.|
040763|351-en|en|wav/p351_315.wav|||For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|
040764|351-en|en|wav/p351_316.wav|||But these things are happening now.|
040765|351-en|en|wav/p351_317.wav|||He will be really pleased about this.|
040766|351-en|en|wav/p351_318.wav|||He had no access to the database.|
040767|351-en|en|wav/p351_319.wav|||They were not up to the required standard.|
040768|351-en|en|wav/p351_320.wav|||He also seems to have been around forever.|
040769|351-en|en|wav/p351_321.wav|||However, it has had only a limited uptake.|
040770|351-en|en|wav/p351_322.wav|||At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|
040771|351-en|en|wav/p351_323.wav|||Others are expected to do so soon.|
040772|351-en|en|wav/p351_324.wav|||They were impressive against France.|
040773|351-en|en|wav/p351_325.wav|||Seven people were already in custody in France.|
040774|351-en|en|wav/p351_326.wav|||I played well but missed a few chances.|
040775|351-en|en|wav/p351_327.wav|||Our approach will be different.|
040776|351-en|en|wav/p351_328.wav|||It's my initial background.|
040777|351-en|en|wav/p351_329.wav|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
040778|351-en|en|wav/p351_330.wav|||They're just a nonsense.|
040779|351-en|en|wav/p351_331.wav|||That has not been the case, as we now know.|
040780|351-en|en|wav/p351_332.wav|||He also called in at another farm.|
040781|351-en|en|wav/p351_333.wav|||But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.|
040782|351-en|en|wav/p351_334.wav|||He will go a long way.|
040783|351-en|en|wav/p351_335.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
040784|351-en|en|wav/p351_336.wav|||I lost a part of me.|
040785|351-en|en|wav/p351_337.wav|||It's so much more fun.|
040786|351-en|en|wav/p351_338.wav|||That's just the kind of thing we have.|
040787|351-en|en|wav/p351_339.wav|||It's getting to me.|
040788|351-en|en|wav/p351_340.wav|||So we talked about that for a bit.|
040789|351-en|en|wav/p351_341.wav|||But he has strong links to Labour.|
040790|351-en|en|wav/p351_342.wav|||I am proud of my team.|
040791|351-en|en|wav/p351_343.wav|||I am a doctor.|
040792|351-en|en|wav/p351_344.wav|||Secondly, there are other options for patients.|
040793|351-en|en|wav/p351_345.wav|||It will carry on.|
040794|351-en|en|wav/p351_346.wav|||Our season is not over.|
040795|351-en|en|wav/p351_347.wav|||I am not retiring.|
040796|351-en|en|wav/p351_348.wav|||Money is not everything in life.|
040797|351-en|en|wav/p351_349.wav|||She kept him on a string.|
040798|351-en|en|wav/p351_350.wav|||It will make a big difference.|
040799|351-en|en|wav/p351_351.wav|||There was no basis for their arrest.|
040800|351-en|en|wav/p351_352.wav|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
040801|351-en|en|wav/p351_353.wav|||The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|
040802|351-en|en|wav/p351_354.wav|||The Government has listened.|
040803|351-en|en|wav/p351_355.wav|||It's only tackling congestion.|
040804|351-en|en|wav/p351_356.wav|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
040805|351-en|en|wav/p351_357.wav|||It's too horrible to think.|
040806|351-en|en|wav/p351_358.wav|||It can be frightening.|
040807|351-en|en|wav/p351_359.wav|||He was, but only just.|
040808|351-en|en|wav/p351_360.wav|||It may be his last for a while, too.|
040809|351-en|en|wav/p351_361.wav|||Further details are expected later.|
040810|351-en|en|wav/p351_362.wav|||What's wrong with that?|
040811|351-en|en|wav/p351_363.wav|||You will never forget the clutching horror.|
040812|351-en|en|wav/p351_364.wav|||Off with their heads.|
040813|351-en|en|wav/p351_365.wav|||I believe she was elected unopposed.|
040814|351-en|en|wav/p351_366.wav|||We are not asking for the moon.|
040815|351-en|en|wav/p351_367.wav|||Now we see the impact of global politics.|
040816|351-en|en|wav/p351_368.wav|||The pain is still acute.|
040817|351-en|en|wav/p351_369.wav|||This was not the show for me.|
040818|351-en|en|wav/p351_370.wav|||It is a very big problem.|
040819|351-en|en|wav/p351_371.wav|||Frustration is not the word.|
040820|351-en|en|wav/p351_372.wav|||The police have to act to help them.|
040821|351-en|en|wav/p351_373.wav|||The cause is just.|
040822|351-en|en|wav/p351_374.wav|||It may be down, but New York is not out.|
040823|351-en|en|wav/p351_375.wav|||Our message is getting through.|
040824|351-en|en|wav/p351_376.wav|||But what lies ahead?|
040825|351-en|en|wav/p351_377.wav|||She makes me so happy.|
040826|351-en|en|wav/p351_378.wav|||They promised to fight the plans.|
040827|351-en|en|wav/p351_379.wav|||My heart is not so sure.|
040828|351-en|en|wav/p351_380.wav|||I am happy for her.|
040829|351-en|en|wav/p351_381.wav|||Finally, he paid for the movie.|
040830|351-en|en|wav/p351_382.wav|||They were just too good for us.|
040831|351-en|en|wav/p351_383.wav|||He was the architect.|
040832|351-en|en|wav/p351_384.wav|||This should include procedures for personal imports.|
040833|351-en|en|wav/p351_385.wav|||It's a fantastic achievement.|
040834|351-en|en|wav/p351_386.wav|||Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.|
040835|351-en|en|wav/p351_387.wav|||Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.|
040836|351-en|en|wav/p351_388.wav|||He, too, was not satisfied.|
040837|351-en|en|wav/p351_389.wav|||It's easy to see why.|
040838|351-en|en|wav/p351_390.wav|||But it didn't happen.|
040839|351-en|en|wav/p351_391.wav|||All were believed to be adults.|
040840|351-en|en|wav/p351_392.wav|||This is the last straw.|
040841|351-en|en|wav/p351_393.wav|||The research was my life.|
040842|351-en|en|wav/p351_394.wav|||I am so, so, so lucky.|
040843|351-en|en|wav/p351_395.wav|||What is it about this series?|
040844|351-en|en|wav/p351_396.wav|||You read it right.|
040845|351-en|en|wav/p351_397.wav|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
040846|351-en|en|wav/p351_398.wav|||I only wanted to give her a fright.|
040847|351-en|en|wav/p351_399.wav|||Where does it come from?|
040848|351-en|en|wav/p351_400.wav|||You find it bizarre?|
040849|351-en|en|wav/p351_401.wav|||I am very excited about this season.|
040850|351-en|en|wav/p351_402.wav|||It has proved a double whammy.|
040851|351-en|en|wav/p351_403.wav|||Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|
040852|351-en|en|wav/p351_404.wav|||It should be a great game, though.|
040853|351-en|en|wav/p351_405.wav|||But is he?|
040854|351-en|en|wav/p351_406.wav|||So it's a daily struggle.|
040855|351-en|en|wav/p351_407.wav|||But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|
040856|351-en|en|wav/p351_408.wav|||If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|
040857|351-en|en|wav/p351_409.wav|||Ministers are not involved in these discussions.|
040858|351-en|en|wav/p351_410.wav|||Everyone has his share of trouble.|
040859|351-en|en|wav/p351_411.wav|||You need a licence to run a pub.|
040860|351-en|en|wav/p351_412.wav|||Everything else is second.|
040861|351-en|en|wav/p351_413.wav|||I am not sure.|
040862|351-en|en|wav/p351_414.wav|||This is a successful outcome.|
040863|351-en|en|wav/p351_415.wav|||His first album was a hit.|
040864|351-en|en|wav/p351_416.wav|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
040865|351-en|en|wav/p351_417.wav|||The plane was shaking.|
040866|351-en|en|wav/p351_418.wav|||It was visibly on fire.|
040867|351-en|en|wav/p351_419.wav|||What's it for, after all?|
040868|351-en|en|wav/p351_420.wav|||We will be pleased to talk to them.|
040869|351-en|en|wav/p351_421.wav|||A number of people could not speak English.|
040870|351-en|en|wav/p351_422.wav|||They have got off with murder.|
040871|351-en|en|wav/p351_423.wav|||I'm going to take it further.|
040872|351-en|en|wav/p351_424.wav|||I kept going for her.|
040873|360-en|en|wav/p360_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
040874|360-en|en|wav/p360_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040875|360-en|en|wav/p360_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040876|360-en|en|wav/p360_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040877|360-en|en|wav/p360_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040878|360-en|en|wav/p360_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040879|360-en|en|wav/p360_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040880|360-en|en|wav/p360_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040881|360-en|en|wav/p360_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040882|360-en|en|wav/p360_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040883|360-en|en|wav/p360_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040884|360-en|en|wav/p360_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040885|360-en|en|wav/p360_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040886|360-en|en|wav/p360_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040887|360-en|en|wav/p360_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040888|360-en|en|wav/p360_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040889|360-en|en|wav/p360_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040890|360-en|en|wav/p360_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040891|360-en|en|wav/p360_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040892|360-en|en|wav/p360_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040893|360-en|en|wav/p360_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040894|360-en|en|wav/p360_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040896|360-en|en|wav/p360_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040897|360-en|en|wav/p360_025.wav|||You can never take a win for granted.|
040898|360-en|en|wav/p360_026.wav|||My conscience is not clear.|
040899|360-en|en|wav/p360_027.wav|||Is that it?|
040900|360-en|en|wav/p360_028.wav|||You have been warned.|
040901|360-en|en|wav/p360_029.wav|||You are not allowed to do that.|
040902|360-en|en|wav/p360_030.wav|||That depends on Rangers.|
040903|360-en|en|wav/p360_031.wav|||There are two problems.|
040904|360-en|en|wav/p360_032.wav|||Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|
040905|360-en|en|wav/p360_033.wav|||It's something which is very important to me.|
040906|360-en|en|wav/p360_034.wav|||For once he was wrong.|
040907|360-en|en|wav/p360_035.wav|||He would not have to explain.|
040908|360-en|en|wav/p360_036.wav|||I want to deliver a learning society.|
040909|360-en|en|wav/p360_037.wav|||We are just happy that hasn't happened.|
040910|360-en|en|wav/p360_038.wav|||I had to be into it.|
040911|360-en|en|wav/p360_039.wav|||I'm so grateful for that.|
040912|360-en|en|wav/p360_040.wav|||It's not been a good year.|
040913|360-en|en|wav/p360_041.wav|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|
040914|360-en|en|wav/p360_042.wav|||I have no intention of resigning today.|
040915|360-en|en|wav/p360_043.wav|||That has now gone.|
040916|360-en|en|wav/p360_044.wav|||Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.|
040917|360-en|en|wav/p360_045.wav|||This will take up to nine months.|
040918|360-en|en|wav/p360_046.wav|||And maybe they have.|
040919|360-en|en|wav/p360_047.wav|||Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|
040920|360-en|en|wav/p360_048.wav|||Is he conscious?|
040921|360-en|en|wav/p360_049.wav|||But we are confident.|
040922|360-en|en|wav/p360_050.wav|||It is like a football team.|
040923|360-en|en|wav/p360_051.wav|||When he came to see me on Monday.|
040924|360-en|en|wav/p360_052.wav|||That's a concern to me.|
040925|360-en|en|wav/p360_053.wav|||She said she was really sorry.|
040926|360-en|en|wav/p360_054.wav|||That will be important.|
040927|360-en|en|wav/p360_055.wav|||But here it is also very bad.|
040928|360-en|en|wav/p360_056.wav|||That view has not altered.|
040929|360-en|en|wav/p360_057.wav|||It was very full anyway.|
040930|360-en|en|wav/p360_058.wav|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
040931|360-en|en|wav/p360_059.wav|||The incidents are not believed to be linked.|
040932|360-en|en|wav/p360_060.wav|||But there is no easy option.|
040933|360-en|en|wav/p360_061.wav|||I can't believe she is dead.|
040934|360-en|en|wav/p360_062.wav|||No person was charged.|
040935|360-en|en|wav/p360_063.wav|||But it would say that.|
040936|360-en|en|wav/p360_064.wav|||Most of the works are small in scale.|
040937|360-en|en|wav/p360_065.wav|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
040938|360-en|en|wav/p360_066.wav|||Only the bomber was killed.|
040939|360-en|en|wav/p360_067.wav|||But he just carried on anyway.|
040940|360-en|en|wav/p360_068.wav|||Nor was it a game without its lessons.|
040941|360-en|en|wav/p360_069.wav|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
040942|360-en|en|wav/p360_070.wav|||His presence was very important.|
040943|360-en|en|wav/p360_071.wav|||What happens next?|
040944|360-en|en|wav/p360_072.wav|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
040945|360-en|en|wav/p360_073.wav|||The bombing begins in five minutes.|
040946|360-en|en|wav/p360_074.wav|||That took two weeks.|
040947|360-en|en|wav/p360_075.wav|||It's worth it, though.|
040948|360-en|en|wav/p360_076.wav|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
040949|360-en|en|wav/p360_077.wav|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
040950|360-en|en|wav/p360_078.wav|||The question was simple enough.|
040951|360-en|en|wav/p360_079.wav|||The voters rejected us.|
040952|360-en|en|wav/p360_080.wav|||There was a definite prejudice.|
040953|360-en|en|wav/p360_081.wav|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
040954|360-en|en|wav/p360_082.wav|||We never publicise it.|
040955|360-en|en|wav/p360_083.wav|||You will be very welcome.|
040956|360-en|en|wav/p360_084.wav|||His musicals were very much of their time.|
040957|360-en|en|wav/p360_085.wav|||He became enchanted with the process.|
040958|360-en|en|wav/p360_086.wav|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
040959|360-en|en|wav/p360_087.wav|||It seems very odd.|
040960|360-en|en|wav/p360_088.wav|||They couldn't keep it together.|
040961|360-en|en|wav/p360_089.wav|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
040962|360-en|en|wav/p360_090.wav|||We will continue to provide support for them.|
040963|360-en|en|wav/p360_091.wav|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
040964|360-en|en|wav/p360_092.wav|||It was looking bad.|
040965|360-en|en|wav/p360_093.wav|||That's what makes it interesting.|
040966|360-en|en|wav/p360_094.wav|||It's nice to be involved.|
040967|360-en|en|wav/p360_095.wav|||It's not a game.|
040968|360-en|en|wav/p360_096.wav|||Buildings are about people.|
040969|360-en|en|wav/p360_097.wav|||There is much work to do.|
040970|360-en|en|wav/p360_098.wav|||The release attracted little attention.|
040971|360-en|en|wav/p360_099.wav|||It was the dreaded sentence.|
040972|360-en|en|wav/p360_100.wav|||I have never considered it.|
040973|360-en|en|wav/p360_101.wav|||It is not in the public interest.|
040974|360-en|en|wav/p360_102.wav|||They had been forced to walk.|
040975|360-en|en|wav/p360_103.wav|||It is harder than you think.|
040976|360-en|en|wav/p360_104.wav|||The call was ignored.|
040977|360-en|en|wav/p360_105.wav|||I am looking forward to it.|
040978|360-en|en|wav/p360_106.wav|||Consumers will also benefit.|
040979|360-en|en|wav/p360_107.wav|||That would be even more disastrous.|
040980|360-en|en|wav/p360_108.wav|||We opened up and everything was gone.|
040981|360-en|en|wav/p360_109.wav|||It is looking very special.|
040982|360-en|en|wav/p360_110.wav|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
040983|360-en|en|wav/p360_111.wav|||People were hitting the floor.|
040984|360-en|en|wav/p360_112.wav|||She was close to suicide at one stage.|
040985|360-en|en|wav/p360_113.wav|||They took a risk.|
040986|360-en|en|wav/p360_114.wav|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
040987|360-en|en|wav/p360_115.wav|||It has no place in football.|
040988|360-en|en|wav/p360_116.wav|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
040989|360-en|en|wav/p360_117.wav|||This is a classic.|
040990|360-en|en|wav/p360_118.wav|||He played it like a veteran.|
040991|360-en|en|wav/p360_119.wav|||I have spoken to head office.|
040992|360-en|en|wav/p360_120.wav|||I'm not thinking about anyone else.|
040993|360-en|en|wav/p360_121.wav|||They will run a mile.|
040994|360-en|en|wav/p360_122.wav|||When she went off it was quite amazing.|
040995|360-en|en|wav/p360_123.wav|||Britain has never had it so good.|
040996|360-en|en|wav/p360_124.wav|||So many people will be affected by this.|
040997|360-en|en|wav/p360_125.wav|||It was all very good stuff.|
040998|360-en|en|wav/p360_126.wav|||Or was it?|
040999|360-en|en|wav/p360_127.wav|||We are under no illusions about this.|
041000|360-en|en|wav/p360_128.wav|||But they are a good team.|
041001|360-en|en|wav/p360_129.wav|||We have a long way to go.|
041002|360-en|en|wav/p360_130.wav|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
041003|360-en|en|wav/p360_131.wav|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
041004|360-en|en|wav/p360_132.wav|||I knew that we needed to get out.|
041005|360-en|en|wav/p360_133.wav|||I had a train to catch.|
041006|360-en|en|wav/p360_134.wav|||And this game is all about belief.|
041007|360-en|en|wav/p360_135.wav|||I am ready for that.|
041008|360-en|en|wav/p360_136.wav|||It is a fantasy.|
041009|360-en|en|wav/p360_137.wav|||The only safe investment is cash.|
041010|360-en|en|wav/p360_138.wav|||That's the way they are.|
041011|360-en|en|wav/p360_139.wav|||Elections would follow in about two years.|
041012|360-en|en|wav/p360_140.wav|||We are trying to be realistic.|
041013|360-en|en|wav/p360_141.wav|||That was the theory.|
041014|360-en|en|wav/p360_142.wav|||Or so it seemed.|
041015|360-en|en|wav/p360_143.wav|||Now we look forward to it.|
041016|360-en|en|wav/p360_144.wav|||That was worth it.|
041017|360-en|en|wav/p360_145.wav|||What's it going to be then?|
041018|360-en|en|wav/p360_146.wav|||Who was being affected?|
041019|360-en|en|wav/p360_147.wav|||Our players are exhausted.|
041020|360-en|en|wav/p360_148.wav|||It is deeply frustrating.|
041021|360-en|en|wav/p360_149.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
041022|360-en|en|wav/p360_150.wav|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
041023|360-en|en|wav/p360_151.wav|||This has been carried out.|
041024|360-en|en|wav/p360_152.wav|||Our time is up.|
041025|360-en|en|wav/p360_153.wav|||It was a moment of madness.|
041026|360-en|en|wav/p360_154.wav|||But other Ministers are not convinced.|
041027|360-en|en|wav/p360_155.wav|||First meeting was next week.|
041028|360-en|en|wav/p360_156.wav|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|
041029|360-en|en|wav/p360_157.wav|||Conditions were very difficult for the players.|
041030|360-en|en|wav/p360_158.wav|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
041031|360-en|en|wav/p360_159.wav|||I didn't think we deserved to go out.|
041032|360-en|en|wav/p360_160.wav|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
041033|360-en|en|wav/p360_161.wav|||I told them they shouldn't say that.|
041034|360-en|en|wav/p360_162.wav|||I don't know how they do it.|
041035|360-en|en|wav/p360_163.wav|||Little is known about them.|
041036|360-en|en|wav/p360_164.wav|||It is a new company for Scotland.|
041037|360-en|en|wav/p360_165.wav|||We're very unhappy about it.|
041038|360-en|en|wav/p360_166.wav|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041039|360-en|en|wav/p360_167.wav|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
041040|360-en|en|wav/p360_168.wav|||It was extremely difficult.|
041041|360-en|en|wav/p360_169.wav|||It is about the script for me.|
041042|360-en|en|wav/p360_170.wav|||I have a good feeling about this.|
041043|360-en|en|wav/p360_171.wav|||And the results were impressive.|
041044|360-en|en|wav/p360_172.wav|||The next game is today.|
041045|360-en|en|wav/p360_173.wav|||Hopefully it will be a good day.|
041046|360-en|en|wav/p360_174.wav|||I was a silly bastard.|
041047|360-en|en|wav/p360_175.wav|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
041048|360-en|en|wav/p360_176.wav|||The process will start tomorrow.|
041049|360-en|en|wav/p360_177.wav|||Was the punishment excessive?|
041050|360-en|en|wav/p360_178.wav|||The police have an awful lot to explain.|
041051|360-en|en|wav/p360_179.wav|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
041052|360-en|en|wav/p360_180.wav|||I could easy do that.|
041053|360-en|en|wav/p360_181.wav|||We are really impressed.|
041054|360-en|en|wav/p360_182.wav|||I try to be clear in the narrative.|
041055|360-en|en|wav/p360_183.wav|||You have to wait.|
041056|360-en|en|wav/p360_184.wav|||I did not see anything to begin with.|
041057|360-en|en|wav/p360_185.wav|||It's their moment of choice.|
041058|360-en|en|wav/p360_186.wav|||I certainly do not agree with that.|
041059|360-en|en|wav/p360_187.wav|||It was a disaster of a race.|
041060|360-en|en|wav/p360_188.wav|||Only one person can claim the credit.|
041061|360-en|en|wav/p360_189.wav|||Maintain the highest standards.|
041062|360-en|en|wav/p360_190.wav|||What could we do?|
041063|360-en|en|wav/p360_191.wav|||O Neill has delivered.|
041064|360-en|en|wav/p360_192.wav|||But there was no going back.|
041065|360-en|en|wav/p360_193.wav|||There are some good people in there.|
041066|360-en|en|wav/p360_194.wav|||But it won't make a difference.|
041067|360-en|en|wav/p360_195.wav|||I'm not going to blame the band.|
041068|360-en|en|wav/p360_196.wav|||I think that he got the message.|
041069|360-en|en|wav/p360_197.wav|||Here it was very subdued.|
041070|360-en|en|wav/p360_198.wav|||Stardom is a funny thing.|
041071|360-en|en|wav/p360_199.wav|||They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|
041072|360-en|en|wav/p360_200.wav|||The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|
041073|360-en|en|wav/p360_201.wav|||I sincerely hope not.|
041074|360-en|en|wav/p360_202.wav|||I'm really looking forward to that.|
041075|360-en|en|wav/p360_203.wav|||She would say he was still the best.|
041076|360-en|en|wav/p360_204.wav|||It is dangerous and it is a lie.|
041077|360-en|en|wav/p360_205.wav|||We didn't, and it worked for us.|
041078|360-en|en|wav/p360_206.wav|||No-one has used it since then.|
041079|360-en|en|wav/p360_207.wav|||The baby was dead.|
041080|360-en|en|wav/p360_208.wav|||That remains the unanswered question.|
041081|360-en|en|wav/p360_209.wav|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
041082|360-en|en|wav/p360_210.wav|||They tried to give her advice.|
041083|360-en|en|wav/p360_211.wav|||We should have no more problems.|
041084|360-en|en|wav/p360_212.wav|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
041085|360-en|en|wav/p360_213.wav|||An announcement is expected soon.|
041086|360-en|en|wav/p360_214.wav|||It was one of those things.|
041087|360-en|en|wav/p360_215.wav|||I can understand that.|
041088|360-en|en|wav/p360_216.wav|||But sometimes it was even worse.|
041089|360-en|en|wav/p360_217.wav|||We had to work hard for it.|
041090|360-en|en|wav/p360_218.wav|||That's a big reduction.|
041091|360-en|en|wav/p360_219.wav|||There will be good prospects ahead.|
041092|360-en|en|wav/p360_220.wav|||I was pleased about that.|
041093|360-en|en|wav/p360_221.wav|||That has not changed.|
041094|360-en|en|wav/p360_222.wav|||It's a creative energy.|
041095|360-en|en|wav/p360_223.wav|||We are not conducting the review.|
041096|360-en|en|wav/p360_224.wav|||It just never comes together.|
041097|360-en|en|wav/p360_225.wav|||The club has never won it.|
041098|360-en|en|wav/p360_226.wav|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
041099|360-en|en|wav/p360_227.wav|||So it was at Easter Road.|
041100|360-en|en|wav/p360_228.wav|||It will be a huge difference.|
041101|360-en|en|wav/p360_229.wav|||Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|
041102|360-en|en|wav/p360_230.wav|||The characters are always the first attraction.|
041103|360-en|en|wav/p360_231.wav|||We've got better players here.|
041104|360-en|en|wav/p360_232.wav|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
041105|360-en|en|wav/p360_233.wav|||This is wonderful news.|
041106|360-en|en|wav/p360_234.wav|||So what's it all about?|
041107|360-en|en|wav/p360_235.wav|||I think he was lost for words.|
041108|360-en|en|wav/p360_236.wav|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041109|360-en|en|wav/p360_237.wav|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
041110|360-en|en|wav/p360_238.wav|||This is a historic occasion.|
041111|360-en|en|wav/p360_239.wav|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
041112|360-en|en|wav/p360_240.wav|||And what happens?|
041113|360-en|en|wav/p360_241.wav|||It is all very upbeat.|
041114|360-en|en|wav/p360_242.wav|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
041115|360-en|en|wav/p360_243.wav|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
041116|360-en|en|wav/p360_244.wav|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
041117|360-en|en|wav/p360_245.wav|||We deserved the draw.|
041118|360-en|en|wav/p360_246.wav|||Just one of those things, we suppose.|
041119|360-en|en|wav/p360_247.wav|||It's up to the defence team.|
041120|360-en|en|wav/p360_248.wav|||No one was injured.|
041121|360-en|en|wav/p360_249.wav|||We have had our debate.|
041122|360-en|en|wav/p360_250.wav|||It is part of his game.|
041123|360-en|en|wav/p360_251.wav|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
041124|360-en|en|wav/p360_252.wav|||But it was too late.|
041125|360-en|en|wav/p360_253.wav|||I didn't see the point.|
041126|360-en|en|wav/p360_254.wav|||It seems a shame to leave it.|
041127|360-en|en|wav/p360_255.wav|||Who would have thought it?|
041128|360-en|en|wav/p360_256.wav|||They were all on a mission.|
041129|360-en|en|wav/p360_257.wav|||Human beings are always the same.|
041130|360-en|en|wav/p360_258.wav|||You will gain from that.|
041131|360-en|en|wav/p360_259.wav|||It makes me feel difficult.|
041132|360-en|en|wav/p360_260.wav|||We couldn't believe it at first.|
041133|360-en|en|wav/p360_261.wav|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
041134|360-en|en|wav/p360_262.wav|||He could still be President.|
041135|360-en|en|wav/p360_263.wav|||It can take a long time.|
041136|360-en|en|wav/p360_264.wav|||I don't intend to do so now.|
041137|360-en|en|wav/p360_265.wav|||There is no answer to it.|
041138|360-en|en|wav/p360_266.wav|||He was pleased with his display.|
041139|360-en|en|wav/p360_267.wav|||The first time you read a play.|
041140|360-en|en|wav/p360_268.wav|||There was no let-up for the minnows.|
041141|360-en|en|wav/p360_269.wav|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
041142|360-en|en|wav/p360_270.wav|||He is having a nightmare.|
041143|360-en|en|wav/p360_271.wav|||That was six years ago.|
041144|360-en|en|wav/p360_272.wav|||Players have to accept this.|
041145|360-en|en|wav/p360_273.wav|||He is completely committed to us.|
041146|360-en|en|wav/p360_274.wav|||Neither had the public.|
041147|360-en|en|wav/p360_275.wav|||It disappeared into the cup.|
041148|360-en|en|wav/p360_276.wav|||They might well be right.|
041149|360-en|en|wav/p360_277.wav|||I have no further comment to make.|
041150|360-en|en|wav/p360_278.wav|||The warning is timely.|
041151|360-en|en|wav/p360_279.wav|||Those were the days.|
041152|360-en|en|wav/p360_280.wav|||The joint bid is still on course.|
041153|360-en|en|wav/p360_281.wav|||A press conference is about politics.|
041154|360-en|en|wav/p360_282.wav|||It was important to bring them all together.|
041155|360-en|en|wav/p360_283.wav|||We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|
041156|360-en|en|wav/p360_284.wav|||They tend to be female and retired.|
041157|360-en|en|wav/p360_285.wav|||These things happen in football but shouldn't.|
041158|360-en|en|wav/p360_286.wav|||It looks as though he will be right.|
041159|360-en|en|wav/p360_287.wav|||We know the fight is going to happen.|
041160|360-en|en|wav/p360_288.wav|||I have played well the past two days.|
041161|360-en|en|wav/p360_289.wav|||Is it on a building site?|
041162|360-en|en|wav/p360_290.wav|||That is the key.|
041163|360-en|en|wav/p360_291.wav|||We've been here before.|
041164|360-en|en|wav/p360_292.wav|||I am in a good position.|
041165|360-en|en|wav/p360_293.wav|||I have never been unemployed.|
041166|360-en|en|wav/p360_294.wav|||We are in it for the long-term.|
041167|360-en|en|wav/p360_295.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
041168|360-en|en|wav/p360_296.wav|||I believe it will happen.|
041169|360-en|en|wav/p360_297.wav|||And Michael was just great.|
041170|360-en|en|wav/p360_298.wav|||He did it well.|
041171|360-en|en|wav/p360_299.wav|||Why have you decided to get married?|
041172|360-en|en|wav/p360_300.wav|||Is it all real?|
041173|360-en|en|wav/p360_301.wav|||He will be missed.|
041174|360-en|en|wav/p360_302.wav|||I would not descend to that level.|
041175|360-en|en|wav/p360_303.wav|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
041176|360-en|en|wav/p360_304.wav|||We will not tolerate it.|
041177|360-en|en|wav/p360_305.wav|||I'm really proud of her.|
041178|360-en|en|wav/p360_306.wav|||What does this mean?|
041179|360-en|en|wav/p360_307.wav|||They are not falling now.|
041180|360-en|en|wav/p360_308.wav|||We are not physical at all.|
041181|360-en|en|wav/p360_309.wav|||Have we not been here before?|
041182|360-en|en|wav/p360_310.wav|||I've been waiting a long time.|
041183|360-en|en|wav/p360_311.wav|||The meaning is very profound and complex.|
041184|360-en|en|wav/p360_312.wav|||You just have to get on with it.|
041185|360-en|en|wav/p360_313.wav|||The response from everyone was wonderful.|
041186|360-en|en|wav/p360_314.wav|||And that match was played in June.|
041187|360-en|en|wav/p360_315.wav|||We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|
041188|360-en|en|wav/p360_316.wav|||I don't mean in a frightening way.|
041189|360-en|en|wav/p360_317.wav|||He is a sort of a mystery figure.|
041190|360-en|en|wav/p360_318.wav|||I have learned a lot.|
041191|360-en|en|wav/p360_319.wav|||It won't be their last.|
041192|360-en|en|wav/p360_320.wav|||You've got to have both sides.|
041193|360-en|en|wav/p360_321.wav|||He has yet to receive a reply.|
041194|360-en|en|wav/p360_322.wav|||It has been only average.|
041195|360-en|en|wav/p360_323.wav|||He should be worried about me.|
041196|360-en|en|wav/p360_324.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
041197|360-en|en|wav/p360_325.wav|||For me, any manager is good.|
041198|360-en|en|wav/p360_326.wav|||Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|
041199|360-en|en|wav/p360_327.wav|||That was the gimmick.|
041200|360-en|en|wav/p360_328.wav|||He refused to name the survivors.|
041201|360-en|en|wav/p360_329.wav|||He has changed my life forever.|
041202|360-en|en|wav/p360_330.wav|||I have no idea.|
041203|360-en|en|wav/p360_331.wav|||This plan is all about respect.|
041204|360-en|en|wav/p360_332.wav|||I don't think he played his best.|
041205|360-en|en|wav/p360_333.wav|||Pakistan denied the report.|
041206|360-en|en|wav/p360_334.wav|||It will be up to the government.|
041207|360-en|en|wav/p360_335.wav|||That is a tragedy.|
041208|360-en|en|wav/p360_336.wav|||I am very happy.|
041209|360-en|en|wav/p360_337.wav|||A child is not a product.|
041210|360-en|en|wav/p360_338.wav|||But this is nonsense.|
041211|360-en|en|wav/p360_339.wav|||You can't get the experience in Austria.|
041212|360-en|en|wav/p360_340.wav|||I'm going to miss it.|
041213|360-en|en|wav/p360_341.wav|||There will be no backing down.|
041214|360-en|en|wav/p360_342.wav|||The atmosphere was excellent.|
041215|360-en|en|wav/p360_343.wav|||That must have had an effect.|
041216|360-en|en|wav/p360_344.wav|||They have brought in the replacement.|
041217|360-en|en|wav/p360_345.wav|||How did it all come about?|
041218|360-en|en|wav/p360_346.wav|||We are working so hard.|
041219|360-en|en|wav/p360_347.wav|||One was a lawyer.|
041220|360-en|en|wav/p360_348.wav|||Our position is extremely simple.|
041221|360-en|en|wav/p360_349.wav|||Where did that finish?|
041222|360-en|en|wav/p360_350.wav|||I suppose it is quite exciting really.|
041223|360-en|en|wav/p360_351.wav|||The most important thing was to win today.|
041224|360-en|en|wav/p360_352.wav|||Golf is not like that.|
041225|360-en|en|wav/p360_353.wav|||This is a moment to seize.|
041226|360-en|en|wav/p360_354.wav|||I would not do that.|
041227|360-en|en|wav/p360_355.wav|||Lots of them haven't recovered that far.|
041228|360-en|en|wav/p360_356.wav|||They said that they stood by their statement.|
041229|360-en|en|wav/p360_357.wav|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
041230|360-en|en|wav/p360_358.wav|||That has to be allowed.|
041231|360-en|en|wav/p360_359.wav|||He has never let them down.|
041232|360-en|en|wav/p360_360.wav|||There was no-one of the required standard.|
041233|360-en|en|wav/p360_361.wav|||That would be very good for Rangers.|
041234|360-en|en|wav/p360_362.wav|||It's something he has worked very hard on.|
041235|360-en|en|wav/p360_363.wav|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
041236|360-en|en|wav/p360_364.wav|||That gives it a spirit.|
041237|360-en|en|wav/p360_365.wav|||She has never been back.|
041238|360-en|en|wav/p360_366.wav|||It will set the tone.|
041239|360-en|en|wav/p360_367.wav|||They are not going away.|
041240|360-en|en|wav/p360_368.wav|||Having done it, he was asked again.|
041241|360-en|en|wav/p360_369.wav|||I think he will.|
041242|360-en|en|wav/p360_370.wav|||The package is a changing one.|
041243|360-en|en|wav/p360_371.wav|||I'm working on that one, too.|
041244|360-en|en|wav/p360_372.wav|||Frankly, that's not good enough.|
041245|360-en|en|wav/p360_373.wav|||Or is it?|
041246|360-en|en|wav/p360_374.wav|||What's the difference?|
041247|360-en|en|wav/p360_375.wav|||The whole family was in shock.|
041248|360-en|en|wav/p360_376.wav|||But everywhere the problems are the same.|
041249|360-en|en|wav/p360_377.wav|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
041250|360-en|en|wav/p360_378.wav|||The problems began a long time ago.|
041251|360-en|en|wav/p360_379.wav|||It meant a lot to us.|
041252|360-en|en|wav/p360_380.wav|||What other retailer would do this?|
041253|360-en|en|wav/p360_381.wav|||Other musicians were found in retirement.|
041254|360-en|en|wav/p360_382.wav|||This country has many challenges.|
041255|360-en|en|wav/p360_383.wav|||Their families are gone.|
041256|360-en|en|wav/p360_384.wav|||IS Tony Blair on drugs?|
041257|360-en|en|wav/p360_385.wav|||I didn't do it.|
041258|360-en|en|wav/p360_386.wav|||They are with their father.|
041259|360-en|en|wav/p360_387.wav|||They're all doing it.|
041260|360-en|en|wav/p360_388.wav|||I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|
041261|360-en|en|wav/p360_389.wav|||No, they are not the same thing.|
041262|360-en|en|wav/p360_390.wav|||In football it is not always the case.|
041263|360-en|en|wav/p360_391.wav|||Sometimes we find a person.|
041264|360-en|en|wav/p360_392.wav|||It is a natural reaction.|
041265|360-en|en|wav/p360_393.wav|||I am in a very difficult position.|
041266|360-en|en|wav/p360_394.wav|||I had to win this race.|
041267|360-en|en|wav/p360_395.wav|||They could have been told in advance.|
041268|360-en|en|wav/p360_396.wav|||And what do we have?|
041269|360-en|en|wav/p360_397.wav|||It is a relief.|
041270|360-en|en|wav/p360_398.wav|||The boat was fantastic.|
041271|360-en|en|wav/p360_399.wav|||These were the edited highlights.|
041272|360-en|en|wav/p360_400.wav|||That is the difference.|
041273|360-en|en|wav/p360_401.wav|||You will need it.|
041274|360-en|en|wav/p360_402.wav|||There is so much at stake.|
041275|360-en|en|wav/p360_403.wav|||It has great potential.|
041276|360-en|en|wav/p360_404.wav|||They had three children.|
041277|360-en|en|wav/p360_405.wav|||It was all too little, too late.|
041278|360-en|en|wav/p360_406.wav|||Still, it is a very good result for us.|
041279|360-en|en|wav/p360_407.wav|||And he's not alone.|
041280|360-en|en|wav/p360_408.wav|||What was all that about?|
041281|360-en|en|wav/p360_409.wav|||What's the problem with change?|
041282|360-en|en|wav/p360_410.wav|||I intend to end it on a high.|
041283|360-en|en|wav/p360_411.wav|||What she can't have is the money.|
041284|360-en|en|wav/p360_412.wav|||I thought they played well.|
041285|360-en|en|wav/p360_413.wav|||This is not the end.|
041286|360-en|en|wav/p360_414.wav|||And they went on to win the title.|
041287|360-en|en|wav/p360_415.wav|||Now, she will not be running at all.|
041288|360-en|en|wav/p360_416.wav|||It's not an impression.|
041289|360-en|en|wav/p360_417.wav|||This was great for our sport.|
041290|360-en|en|wav/p360_418.wav|||There's no place to hide.|
041291|360-en|en|wav/p360_419.wav|||I don't think they are too serious.|
041292|360-en|en|wav/p360_420.wav|||Tiger is the exception.|
041293|360-en|en|wav/p360_421.wav|||There was no happy ending.|
041294|360-en|en|wav/p360_422.wav|||They need time to think.|
041295|360-en|en|wav/p360_423.wav|||It's unfair on her.|
041296|360-en|en|wav/p360_424.wav|||As for Owen, class is permanent.|
041297|361-en|en|wav/p361_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
041298|361-en|en|wav/p361_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
041299|361-en|en|wav/p361_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041300|361-en|en|wav/p361_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041301|361-en|en|wav/p361_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041302|361-en|en|wav/p361_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041303|361-en|en|wav/p361_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041304|361-en|en|wav/p361_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041305|361-en|en|wav/p361_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041306|361-en|en|wav/p361_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041307|361-en|en|wav/p361_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041308|361-en|en|wav/p361_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041309|361-en|en|wav/p361_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041310|361-en|en|wav/p361_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041311|361-en|en|wav/p361_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041312|361-en|en|wav/p361_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041313|361-en|en|wav/p361_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041314|361-en|en|wav/p361_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041315|361-en|en|wav/p361_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041316|361-en|en|wav/p361_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041317|361-en|en|wav/p361_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041318|361-en|en|wav/p361_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041319|361-en|en|wav/p361_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041320|361-en|en|wav/p361_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041321|361-en|en|wav/p361_025.wav|||Something has to be done.|
041322|361-en|en|wav/p361_026.wav|||That is where the damage has been done.|
041323|361-en|en|wav/p361_027.wav|||He may not need to force that message.|
041324|361-en|en|wav/p361_028.wav|||These decisions are not simple.|
041325|361-en|en|wav/p361_029.wav|||The results were very clear.|
041326|361-en|en|wav/p361_030.wav|||We must convince the citizens.|
041327|361-en|en|wav/p361_031.wav|||I decided it is going to be William.|
041328|361-en|en|wav/p361_032.wav|||But we need to keep it there.|
041329|361-en|en|wav/p361_033.wav|||It is a case of taking a risk.|
041330|361-en|en|wav/p361_034.wav|||I am really ready for it now.|
041331|361-en|en|wav/p361_035.wav|||He was jailed for four years.|
041332|361-en|en|wav/p361_036.wav|||We felt it was sufficient.|
041333|361-en|en|wav/p361_037.wav|||This decision is folly.|
041334|361-en|en|wav/p361_038.wav|||And this was well known?|
041335|361-en|en|wav/p361_039.wav|||It took two minutes to respond.|
041336|361-en|en|wav/p361_040.wav|||Why you did it will never be known.|
041337|361-en|en|wav/p361_041.wav|||He was in his element.|
041338|361-en|en|wav/p361_042.wav|||That means an extra two years.|
041339|361-en|en|wav/p361_043.wav|||So, we have to go back.|
041340|361-en|en|wav/p361_044.wav|||I'm sure he does.|
041341|361-en|en|wav/p361_045.wav|||He was found again almost a year later.|
041342|361-en|en|wav/p361_046.wav|||The answer was wrong.|
041343|361-en|en|wav/p361_047.wav|||They need to be helped.|
041344|361-en|en|wav/p361_048.wav|||It is all starting to come together.|
041345|361-en|en|wav/p361_049.wav|||I am the fastest player on the course.|
041346|361-en|en|wav/p361_050.wav|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
041347|361-en|en|wav/p361_051.wav|||They were taken to prove a point.|
041348|361-en|en|wav/p361_052.wav|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
041349|361-en|en|wav/p361_053.wav|||It is an important step forward.|
041350|361-en|en|wav/p361_054.wav|||A final agreement has not yet been completed.|
041351|361-en|en|wav/p361_055.wav|||And they removed a Borderer.|
041352|361-en|en|wav/p361_056.wav|||That is the way it is.|
041353|361-en|en|wav/p361_057.wav|||That was something else.|
041354|361-en|en|wav/p361_058.wav|||This resulted in the following.|
041355|361-en|en|wav/p361_059.wav|||I want to deal with this stuff.|
041356|361-en|en|wav/p361_060.wav|||We will be patient but we will win.|
041357|361-en|en|wav/p361_061.wav|||As good as they come.|
041358|361-en|en|wav/p361_062.wav|||It is not for me to say.|
041359|361-en|en|wav/p361_063.wav|||For that much we must be grateful.|
041360|361-en|en|wav/p361_064.wav|||But the law is very clear on this.|
041361|361-en|en|wav/p361_065.wav|||I thought it was quite a positive result.|
041362|361-en|en|wav/p361_066.wav|||But we are very near.|
041363|361-en|en|wav/p361_067.wav|||Nobody else is at risk.|
041364|361-en|en|wav/p361_068.wav|||We are not going to back off.|
041365|361-en|en|wav/p361_069.wav|||He said it was for sale.|
041366|361-en|en|wav/p361_070.wav|||We have a strong team at the moment.|
041367|361-en|en|wav/p361_071.wav|||This is a dream come true.|
041368|361-en|en|wav/p361_072.wav|||The problem is not confined to the UK.|
041369|361-en|en|wav/p361_073.wav|||It is on the news.|
041370|361-en|en|wav/p361_074.wav|||They said there was nothing.|
041371|361-en|en|wav/p361_075.wav|||They were looking for things.|
041372|361-en|en|wav/p361_076.wav|||I've got to be better than that   Quite.|
041373|361-en|en|wav/p361_077.wav|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
041374|361-en|en|wav/p361_078.wav|||As it should be.|
041375|361-en|en|wav/p361_079.wav|||We have never been short of volunteers.|
041376|361-en|en|wav/p361_080.wav|||But who is it?|
041377|361-en|en|wav/p361_081.wav|||Kenny Miller might come through.|
041378|361-en|en|wav/p361_082.wav|||Workers will now be balloted on the offer.|
041379|361-en|en|wav/p361_083.wav|||It just isn't there.|
041380|361-en|en|wav/p361_084.wav|||Drama is not one of them.|
041381|361-en|en|wav/p361_085.wav|||And we have a singer.|
041382|361-en|en|wav/p361_086.wav|||It was exactly four months away.|
041383|361-en|en|wav/p361_087.wav|||This is a personal decision for me.|
041384|361-en|en|wav/p361_088.wav|||It's just a failing service.|
041385|361-en|en|wav/p361_089.wav|||We all want to be left alone.|
041386|361-en|en|wav/p361_090.wav|||I was saying, No.|
041387|361-en|en|wav/p361_091.wav|||Where are they?|
041388|361-en|en|wav/p361_092.wav|||I am delighted to hear this news.|
041389|361-en|en|wav/p361_093.wav|||I knew him a little.|
041390|361-en|en|wav/p361_094.wav|||They just have a go.|
041391|361-en|en|wav/p361_095.wav|||If it's going in, it goes in.|
041392|361-en|en|wav/p361_096.wav|||Nobody called me to explain.|
041393|361-en|en|wav/p361_097.wav|||You didn't get a modified.|
041394|361-en|en|wav/p361_098.wav|||What kind of person is he?|
041395|361-en|en|wav/p361_099.wav|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
041396|361-en|en|wav/p361_100.wav|||What has changed since then?|
041397|361-en|en|wav/p361_101.wav|||He knows he is good.|
041398|361-en|en|wav/p361_102.wav|||I welcome the decision.|
041399|361-en|en|wav/p361_103.wav|||It could take some time.|
041400|361-en|en|wav/p361_104.wav|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
041401|361-en|en|wav/p361_105.wav|||It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|
041402|361-en|en|wav/p361_106.wav|||I've done a lot in that building.|
041403|361-en|en|wav/p361_107.wav|||Music is all consuming.|
041404|361-en|en|wav/p361_108.wav|||The results are very positive.|
041405|361-en|en|wav/p361_109.wav|||Talk of a crisis is absurd.|
041406|361-en|en|wav/p361_110.wav|||Which is where we come in.|
041407|361-en|en|wav/p361_111.wav|||I'm not looking forward to it.|
041408|361-en|en|wav/p361_112.wav|||Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.|
041409|361-en|en|wav/p361_113.wav|||He is a pro.|
041410|361-en|en|wav/p361_114.wav|||They have to tell it as it is.|
041411|361-en|en|wav/p361_115.wav|||This could easily have been another tragedy.|
041412|361-en|en|wav/p361_116.wav|||You should enjoy the day.|
041413|361-en|en|wav/p361_117.wav|||He was taken ill in his office.|
041414|361-en|en|wav/p361_118.wav|||We couldn't get enough of it.|
041415|361-en|en|wav/p361_119.wav|||Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|
041416|361-en|en|wav/p361_120.wav|||I am not very pleased.|
041417|361-en|en|wav/p361_121.wav|||It is just a statement of fact.|
041418|361-en|en|wav/p361_122.wav|||It was on my mind a little bit.|
041419|361-en|en|wav/p361_123.wav|||I will just have to be patient.|
041420|361-en|en|wav/p361_124.wav|||I didn't think about it again.|
041421|361-en|en|wav/p361_125.wav|||And if they fail?|
041422|361-en|en|wav/p361_126.wav|||He has gone through the process before.|
041423|361-en|en|wav/p361_127.wav|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
041424|361-en|en|wav/p361_128.wav|||We've always had something to do.|
041425|361-en|en|wav/p361_129.wav|||How do you take them away?|
041426|361-en|en|wav/p361_130.wav|||It will be released in October.|
041427|361-en|en|wav/p361_132.wav|||That got me out.|
041428|361-en|en|wav/p361_133.wav|||IT is called a killing in the trade.|
041429|361-en|en|wav/p361_134.wav|||It's a matter for the Committee.|
041430|361-en|en|wav/p361_135.wav|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
041431|361-en|en|wav/p361_136.wav|||I've never seen anything like it.|
041432|361-en|en|wav/p361_137.wav|||It was highly successful.|
041433|361-en|en|wav/p361_138.wav|||We needed someone and we now have him.|
041434|361-en|en|wav/p361_139.wav|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
041435|361-en|en|wav/p361_140.wav|||Only one was from Glasgow.|
041436|361-en|en|wav/p361_141.wav|||I'm sure he will be aware of it.|
041437|361-en|en|wav/p361_142.wav|||Until you hit the big games.|
041438|361-en|en|wav/p361_143.wav|||They received no money under the merger.|
041439|361-en|en|wav/p361_144.wav|||It was a big departure.|
041440|361-en|en|wav/p361_145.wav|||She has never mentioned it.|
041441|361-en|en|wav/p361_146.wav|||I want my mum.|
041442|361-en|en|wav/p361_147.wav|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
041443|361-en|en|wav/p361_148.wav|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
041444|361-en|en|wav/p361_149.wav|||There are no second chances.|
041445|361-en|en|wav/p361_150.wav|||And it was great for me.|
041446|361-en|en|wav/p361_151.wav|||I am extremely sad.|
041447|361-en|en|wav/p361_152.wav|||This series is for real.|
041448|361-en|en|wav/p361_153.wav|||It has still to be recovered.|
041449|361-en|en|wav/p361_154.wav|||The conclusion is the same.|
041450|361-en|en|wav/p361_155.wav|||I wish they would commit to us.|
041451|361-en|en|wav/p361_156.wav|||The driver just insulted me.|
041452|361-en|en|wav/p361_157.wav|||Something has to be put in place.|
041453|361-en|en|wav/p361_158.wav|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
041454|361-en|en|wav/p361_159.wav|||It's a mixture of everything.|
041455|361-en|en|wav/p361_160.wav|||That is the sensible outcome.|
041456|361-en|en|wav/p361_161.wav|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
041457|361-en|en|wav/p361_162.wav|||This means a lot of hard decisions.|
041458|361-en|en|wav/p361_163.wav|||That comes at a cost.|
041459|361-en|en|wav/p361_164.wav|||And so did the rest of her team.|
041460|361-en|en|wav/p361_165.wav|||He tells the truth and that's important.|
041461|361-en|en|wav/p361_166.wav|||Those are difficult decisions.|
041462|361-en|en|wav/p361_167.wav|||The omens are not good.|
041463|361-en|en|wav/p361_168.wav|||The game was there to be won.|
041464|361-en|en|wav/p361_169.wav|||Then there's the casting.|
041465|361-en|en|wav/p361_170.wav|||There is no signature.|
041466|361-en|en|wav/p361_171.wav|||We can't go on like this.|
041467|361-en|en|wav/p361_172.wav|||It is a very demanding course.|
041468|361-en|en|wav/p361_173.wav|||Can he do it?|
041469|361-en|en|wav/p361_174.wav|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
041470|361-en|en|wav/p361_175.wav|||I've won the British.|
041471|361-en|en|wav/p361_176.wav|||If they wish to go, they can go.|
041472|361-en|en|wav/p361_177.wav|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
041473|361-en|en|wav/p361_178.wav|||I was just aghast.|
041474|361-en|en|wav/p361_179.wav|||They get money for it now.|
041475|361-en|en|wav/p361_180.wav|||I could have been offended.|
041476|361-en|en|wav/p361_181.wav|||That's not the way to think.|
041477|361-en|en|wav/p361_182.wav|||I can see it now.|
041478|361-en|en|wav/p361_183.wav|||Then everyone must consider their future.|
041479|361-en|en|wav/p361_184.wav|||There was nothing she could do.|
041480|361-en|en|wav/p361_185.wav|||We want to be part of it.|
041481|361-en|en|wav/p361_186.wav|||It was a bit of a shock.|
041482|361-en|en|wav/p361_187.wav|||It's not long enough.|
041483|361-en|en|wav/p361_188.wav|||This is positive and welcome.|
041484|361-en|en|wav/p361_189.wav|||Now he is back on top again.|
041485|361-en|en|wav/p361_190.wav|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
041486|361-en|en|wav/p361_191.wav|||Anything less will not do.|
041487|361-en|en|wav/p361_192.wav|||Failure is not an option.|
041488|361-en|en|wav/p361_193.wav|||That is clearly not happening fast enough.|
041489|361-en|en|wav/p361_194.wav|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
041490|361-en|en|wav/p361_195.wav|||You look at that.|
041491|361-en|en|wav/p361_196.wav|||They will be very physical.|
041492|361-en|en|wav/p361_197.wav|||It has been well worth it.|
041493|361-en|en|wav/p361_198.wav|||It was just a feeling.|
041494|361-en|en|wav/p361_199.wav|||People are trying to run away.|
041495|361-en|en|wav/p361_200.wav|||On the face of it, this is excellent news.|
041496|361-en|en|wav/p361_201.wav|||This is clearly not abuse.|
041497|361-en|en|wav/p361_202.wav|||He should be careful.|
041498|361-en|en|wav/p361_203.wav|||Everyone knew the family.|
041499|361-en|en|wav/p361_204.wav|||I am prepared to step down.|
041500|361-en|en|wav/p361_205.wav|||Translation - we got it wrong.|
041501|361-en|en|wav/p361_206.wav|||We will be working on that this week, all right.|
041502|361-en|en|wav/p361_207.wav|||These are serious matters.|
041503|361-en|en|wav/p361_208.wav|||The pace is telling.|
041504|361-en|en|wav/p361_209.wav|||She has always been very friendly.|
041505|361-en|en|wav/p361_210.wav|||Their loss is heartbreaking.|
041506|361-en|en|wav/p361_211.wav|||It is his script.|
041507|361-en|en|wav/p361_212.wav|||I am a socialist.|
041508|361-en|en|wav/p361_213.wav|||The response was really good.|
041509|361-en|en|wav/p361_214.wav|||The squad is too small.|
041510|361-en|en|wav/p361_215.wav|||You can blame the defence.|
041511|361-en|en|wav/p361_216.wav|||Usually the enjoyment is two ways.|
041512|361-en|en|wav/p361_217.wav|||It just could be a good night.|
041513|361-en|en|wav/p361_218.wav|||But we were wrong.|
041514|361-en|en|wav/p361_219.wav|||This has gone on too long.|
041515|361-en|en|wav/p361_220.wav|||It is an outrage.|
041516|361-en|en|wav/p361_221.wav|||It is a performance.|
041517|361-en|en|wav/p361_222.wav|||It is the best place.|
041518|361-en|en|wav/p361_223.wav|||We tried to get them down.|
041519|361-en|en|wav/p361_224.wav|||There were other problems for Brown yesterday.|
041520|361-en|en|wav/p361_225.wav|||I don't know the full story.|
041521|361-en|en|wav/p361_226.wav|||Part-time staff are being laid off.|
041522|361-en|en|wav/p361_227.wav|||Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|
041523|361-en|en|wav/p361_228.wav|||But they have taken the lesson to heart.|
041524|361-en|en|wav/p361_229.wav|||I just want him to win a tournament.|
041525|361-en|en|wav/p361_230.wav|||Eight others are also believed to have died.|
041526|361-en|en|wav/p361_231.wav|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
041527|361-en|en|wav/p361_232.wav|||I will never see my son again.|
041528|361-en|en|wav/p361_233.wav|||But it is being pursued.|
041529|361-en|en|wav/p361_234.wav|||He knew they were there.|
041530|361-en|en|wav/p361_235.wav|||That would end it for us.|
041531|361-en|en|wav/p361_236.wav|||We didn't and it cost us the game.|
041532|361-en|en|wav/p361_237.wav|||It attracted no complaints.|
041533|361-en|en|wav/p361_238.wav|||Neil is never going to come back.|
041534|361-en|en|wav/p361_239.wav|||The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|
041535|361-en|en|wav/p361_240.wav|||Four of the victims were women.|
041536|361-en|en|wav/p361_241.wav|||He was also very happy to listen.|
041537|361-en|en|wav/p361_242.wav|||It's to do with this place.|
041538|361-en|en|wav/p361_243.wav|||It's a technical demand.|
041539|361-en|en|wav/p361_244.wav|||Sadly it is a mess.|
041540|361-en|en|wav/p361_245.wav|||That has to take its toll.|
041541|361-en|en|wav/p361_246.wav|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
041542|361-en|en|wav/p361_247.wav|||But those days are dead and gone.|
041543|361-en|en|wav/p361_248.wav|||However we must not be complacent.|
041544|361-en|en|wav/p361_249.wav|||And that was just the start.|
041545|361-en|en|wav/p361_250.wav|||Nothing was meant by it.|
041546|361-en|en|wav/p361_251.wav|||That was my last game.|
041547|361-en|en|wav/p361_252.wav|||Colour is another problem.|
041548|361-en|en|wav/p361_253.wav|||It is not just the agencies.|
041549|361-en|en|wav/p361_254.wav|||It came in bits and pieces.|
041550|361-en|en|wav/p361_255.wav|||You don't see that.|
041551|361-en|en|wav/p361_256.wav|||They seem to be, anyway.|
041552|361-en|en|wav/p361_257.wav|||I thought they were just excited.|
041553|361-en|en|wav/p361_258.wav|||He will appear in court today.|
041554|361-en|en|wav/p361_259.wav|||Or is he?|
041555|361-en|en|wav/p361_260.wav|||Was he confident about his prospects?|
041556|361-en|en|wav/p361_261.wav|||What can you do?|
041557|361-en|en|wav/p361_262.wav|||It's been very difficult.|
041558|361-en|en|wav/p361_263.wav|||Do something that we need.|
041559|361-en|en|wav/p361_264.wav|||There is no other offer on the table.|
041560|361-en|en|wav/p361_265.wav|||When she returned, it was a wreck.|
041561|361-en|en|wav/p361_266.wav|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
041562|361-en|en|wav/p361_267.wav|||It is difficult to say.|
041563|361-en|en|wav/p361_268.wav|||He is not the only one.|
041564|361-en|en|wav/p361_269.wav|||We call it marriage.|
041565|361-en|en|wav/p361_270.wav|||Full back was a bit of the unknown.|
041566|361-en|en|wav/p361_271.wav|||It's not the tour.|
041567|361-en|en|wav/p361_272.wav|||So what is the secret of the success?|
041568|361-en|en|wav/p361_273.wav|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
041569|361-en|en|wav/p361_274.wav|||So was the first half.|
041570|361-en|en|wav/p361_275.wav|||It is still under discussion with the board.|
041571|361-en|en|wav/p361_276.wav|||That is one point of view.|
041572|361-en|en|wav/p361_277.wav|||We are in this for the long haul.|
041573|361-en|en|wav/p361_278.wav|||Here we go then.|
041574|361-en|en|wav/p361_279.wav|||No reason was given.|
041575|361-en|en|wav/p361_280.wav|||I can't wait for it to come out.|
041576|361-en|en|wav/p361_281.wav|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
041577|361-en|en|wav/p361_282.wav|||Indeed, that has already begun.|
041578|361-en|en|wav/p361_283.wav|||But it's the truth.|
041579|361-en|en|wav/p361_284.wav|||We have been here before.|
041580|361-en|en|wav/p361_285.wav|||And he did that.|
041581|361-en|en|wav/p361_286.wav|||And she is very clear on this.|
041582|361-en|en|wav/p361_287.wav|||His remarks were disgraceful.|
041583|361-en|en|wav/p361_288.wav|||I did not think it was very proper.|
041584|361-en|en|wav/p361_289.wav|||I have really noticed that this week.|
041585|361-en|en|wav/p361_290.wav|||In a way he was.|
041586|361-en|en|wav/p361_291.wav|||I will never forget that.|
041587|361-en|en|wav/p361_292.wav|||It was considered to be topical.|
041588|361-en|en|wav/p361_293.wav|||Well, that's all right then.|
041589|361-en|en|wav/p361_294.wav|||No-one is a winner in this.|
041590|361-en|en|wav/p361_295.wav|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
041591|361-en|en|wav/p361_296.wav|||What do you think?|
041592|361-en|en|wav/p361_297.wav|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
041593|361-en|en|wav/p361_298.wav|||If we don't do it, someone else will.|
041594|361-en|en|wav/p361_299.wav|||Again, there was no detail.|
041595|361-en|en|wav/p361_300.wav|||Let the voters decide.|
041596|361-en|en|wav/p361_301.wav|||Then it will come.|
041597|361-en|en|wav/p361_302.wav|||It should be easy.|
041598|361-en|en|wav/p361_303.wav|||Is it worth it?|
041599|361-en|en|wav/p361_304.wav|||I will build a house on the site.|
041600|361-en|en|wav/p361_305.wav|||We are right at the heart of Europe.|
041601|361-en|en|wav/p361_306.wav|||I do my job.|
041602|361-en|en|wav/p361_307.wav|||They have to get that sorted.|
041603|361-en|en|wav/p361_308.wav|||That is a dangerous assumption.|
041604|361-en|en|wav/p361_309.wav|||Does it make a profit?|
041605|361-en|en|wav/p361_310.wav|||I think it's a good sign.|
041606|361-en|en|wav/p361_311.wav|||A winter of discontent awaits.|
041607|361-en|en|wav/p361_312.wav|||I knew him well.|
041608|361-en|en|wav/p361_313.wav|||I am not ready to walk away.|
041609|361-en|en|wav/p361_314.wav|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
041610|361-en|en|wav/p361_315.wav|||They are already there.|
041611|361-en|en|wav/p361_316.wav|||I'd never given up on myself.|
041612|361-en|en|wav/p361_317.wav|||The concerns were unfounded.|
041613|361-en|en|wav/p361_318.wav|||It doesn't look good for her.|
041614|361-en|en|wav/p361_319.wav|||It was a management problem in the hospital.|
041615|361-en|en|wav/p361_320.wav|||I have some comments.|
041616|361-en|en|wav/p361_321.wav|||You have to be realistic.|
041617|361-en|en|wav/p361_322.wav|||There was nowhere for him to go.|
041618|361-en|en|wav/p361_323.wav|||Not that he was complaining.|
041619|361-en|en|wav/p361_324.wav|||We are very proud of him.|
041620|361-en|en|wav/p361_325.wav|||There they were, making excuses for him.|
041621|361-en|en|wav/p361_326.wav|||It just got out of control.|
041622|361-en|en|wav/p361_327.wav|||Every case is completely different.|
041623|361-en|en|wav/p361_328.wav|||It's all about unfinished business.|
041624|361-en|en|wav/p361_329.wav|||Our own people are coming over on Friday.|
041625|361-en|en|wav/p361_330.wav|||In Scotland, there should be vigilance.|
041626|361-en|en|wav/p361_331.wav|||It will be fine.|
041627|361-en|en|wav/p361_332.wav|||Yet the job is far from over.|
041628|361-en|en|wav/p361_333.wav|||He has a point.|
041629|361-en|en|wav/p361_334.wav|||He should emerge as the winner.|
041630|361-en|en|wav/p361_335.wav|||It is our other home.|
041631|361-en|en|wav/p361_336.wav|||When you think you cannot go on, you can.|
041632|361-en|en|wav/p361_337.wav|||What a difference a game can make.|
041633|361-en|en|wav/p361_338.wav|||It is their day.|
041634|361-en|en|wav/p361_339.wav|||They are a very good side, without a doubt.|
041635|361-en|en|wav/p361_340.wav|||They are used to it.|
041636|361-en|en|wav/p361_341.wav|||And we are doing it.|
041637|361-en|en|wav/p361_342.wav|||It's just not good enough.|
041638|361-en|en|wav/p361_343.wav|||I have a cold.|
041639|361-en|en|wav/p361_344.wav|||You've got to hand it to them.|
041640|361-en|en|wav/p361_345.wav|||Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.|
041641|361-en|en|wav/p361_346.wav|||It was his own decision.|
041642|361-en|en|wav/p361_347.wav|||This is still happening in the US.|
041643|361-en|en|wav/p361_348.wav|||And that was the real problem.|
041644|361-en|en|wav/p361_349.wav|||But then the problems began.|
041645|361-en|en|wav/p361_350.wav|||It wasn't about her singing, though.|
041646|361-en|en|wav/p361_351.wav|||From the opening Could It Be Magic?|
041647|361-en|en|wav/p361_352.wav|||The duties are still to be drawn up.|
041648|361-en|en|wav/p361_353.wav|||That there would be discussions.|
041649|361-en|en|wav/p361_354.wav|||It must not happen.|
041650|361-en|en|wav/p361_355.wav|||That would be unsafe.|
041651|361-en|en|wav/p361_356.wav|||I did not go looking anywhere else.|
041652|361-en|en|wav/p361_357.wav|||We had no idea what was going on.|
041653|361-en|en|wav/p361_358.wav|||If only it had been.|
041654|361-en|en|wav/p361_359.wav|||So far, it is no more.|
041655|361-en|en|wav/p361_360.wav|||Seven people were critically injured.|
041656|361-en|en|wav/p361_361.wav|||I am very sorry to be here.|
041657|361-en|en|wav/p361_362.wav|||He could have given them a lot.|
041658|361-en|en|wav/p361_363.wav|||It was up to him.|
041659|361-en|en|wav/p361_364.wav|||It's going to happen.|
041660|361-en|en|wav/p361_365.wav|||I don't think so.|
041661|361-en|en|wav/p361_366.wav|||And that was just about that.|
041662|361-en|en|wav/p361_367.wav|||By hard work, is the answer.|
041663|361-en|en|wav/p361_368.wav|||It is really special to me.|
041664|361-en|en|wav/p361_369.wav|||This is a major step forward.|
041665|361-en|en|wav/p361_370.wav|||They haven't got the uniform.|
041666|361-en|en|wav/p361_371.wav|||Well, you don't have time.|
041667|361-en|en|wav/p361_372.wav|||It is very funny.|
041668|361-en|en|wav/p361_373.wav|||I just hope it's not tonight against us.|
041669|361-en|en|wav/p361_374.wav|||This is good news for the industry.|
041670|361-en|en|wav/p361_375.wav|||There are no quick fixes.|
041671|361-en|en|wav/p361_376.wav|||Because they didn't want to know.|
041672|361-en|en|wav/p361_377.wav|||What do we have to do?|
041673|361-en|en|wav/p361_378.wav|||I have never seen anything like it.|
041674|361-en|en|wav/p361_379.wav|||It's about New Yorkers.|
041675|361-en|en|wav/p361_380.wav|||That was a real challenge.|
041676|361-en|en|wav/p361_381.wav|||They will give it a couple of years.|
041677|361-en|en|wav/p361_382.wav|||He certainly would have approved.|
041678|361-en|en|wav/p361_383.wav|||Conditions were less than ideal.|
041679|361-en|en|wav/p361_384.wav|||We want this place to work.|
041680|361-en|en|wav/p361_385.wav|||Father is on the train.|
041681|361-en|en|wav/p361_386.wav|||It could have been prevented.|
041682|361-en|en|wav/p361_387.wav|||We have been going for three years.|
041683|361-en|en|wav/p361_388.wav|||Firstly, we don't know we can do this.|
041684|361-en|en|wav/p361_389.wav|||I think it was entirely the right decision.|
041685|361-en|en|wav/p361_390.wav|||It is planned for London in the spring.|
041686|361-en|en|wav/p361_391.wav|||Everything is coming together well.|
041687|361-en|en|wav/p361_392.wav|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
041688|361-en|en|wav/p361_393.wav|||But we are not afraid of them.|
041689|361-en|en|wav/p361_394.wav|||It didn't matter who was in their way.|
041690|361-en|en|wav/p361_395.wav|||That will be the criteria for the future.|
041691|361-en|en|wav/p361_396.wav|||They thought they couldn't get any.|
041692|361-en|en|wav/p361_397.wav|||He was too good for me - too consistent.|
041693|361-en|en|wav/p361_398.wav|||I am delighted to have her back home.|
041694|361-en|en|wav/p361_399.wav|||This idea is a good starting point.|
041695|361-en|en|wav/p361_400.wav|||She had denied the charge.|
041696|361-en|en|wav/p361_401.wav|||It was cynical and callous.|
041697|361-en|en|wav/p361_402.wav|||It's a dead end.|
041698|361-en|en|wav/p361_403.wav|||What sort of man is that?|
041699|361-en|en|wav/p361_404.wav|||The message was clear.|

041711|361-en|en|wav/p361_416.wav|||This was a very tragic accident.|
041712|361-en|en|wav/p361_417.wav|||We are very, very confident.|
041713|361-en|en|wav/p361_418.wav|||It is a result we should savour.|

041719|361-en|en|wav/p361_424.wav|||But what took them so long?|

041724|362-en|en|wav/p362_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041725|362-en|en|wav/p362_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041726|362-en|en|wav/p362_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041727|362-en|en|wav/p362_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041728|362-en|en|wav/p362_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041729|362-en|en|wav/p362_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041730|362-en|en|wav/p362_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041731|362-en|en|wav/p362_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041732|362-en|en|wav/p362_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041733|362-en|en|wav/p362_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

041736|362-en|en|wav/p362_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041737|362-en|en|wav/p362_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041738|362-en|en|wav/p362_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041739|362-en|en|wav/p362_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041740|362-en|en|wav/p362_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041741|362-en|en|wav/p362_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041743|362-en|en|wav/p362_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

041745|362-en|en|wav/p362_026.wav|||This is your country.|

041761|362-en|en|wav/p362_042.wav|||The chances were plentiful.|

041765|362-en|en|wav/p362_046.wav|||The cause is just.|
041766|362-en|en|wav/p362_047.wav|||I am so upset.|
041767|362-en|en|wav/p362_048.wav|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
041768|362-en|en|wav/p362_049.wav|||They finished second and third.|
041769|362-en|en|wav/p362_050.wav|||But this was refused.|
041770|362-en|en|wav/p362_051.wav|||Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.|

041772|362-en|en|wav/p362_053.wav|||We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.|
041773|362-en|en|wav/p362_054.wav|||We certainly hope we have been successful.|
041774|362-en|en|wav/p362_055.wav|||He is one of them.|
041775|362-en|en|wav/p362_056.wav|||This was no accident.|

041907|362-en|en|wav/p362_188.wav|||I thought he was at fault.|
041908|362-en|en|wav/p362_189.wav|||The First Minister is an addict.|
041909|362-en|en|wav/p362_190.wav|||We will win this tie.|
041910|362-en|en|wav/p362_191.wav|||I think he's done it a few times.|
041911|362-en|en|wav/p362_192.wav|||Something happened on that island.|
041912|362-en|en|wav/p362_193.wav|||This is a business.|
041913|362-en|en|wav/p362_194.wav|||Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|
041914|362-en|en|wav/p362_195.wav|||I never had any real direction at school.|
041915|362-en|en|wav/p362_196.wav|||That's how it works.|
041916|362-en|en|wav/p362_197.wav|||It is quite a young team, so the future is there.|
041917|362-en|en|wav/p362_198.wav|||Do what you want to do.|
041918|362-en|en|wav/p362_199.wav|||We know the quality of life goes up.|
041919|362-en|en|wav/p362_200.wav|||Who are the public?|
041920|362-en|en|wav/p362_201.wav|||When it is ready, it will be signed.|
041921|362-en|en|wav/p362_203.wav|||But we have learned that it doesn't.|
041922|362-en|en|wav/p362_204.wav|||I'm looking forward to coming home.|
041923|362-en|en|wav/p362_205.wav|||They should not be blamed for it.|
041924|362-en|en|wav/p362_206.wav|||He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|
041925|362-en|en|wav/p362_207.wav|||Glasgow is a very welcoming place.|
041926|362-en|en|wav/p362_208.wav|||It was crucial strike.|
041927|362-en|en|wav/p362_209.wav|||I have no secrets.|
041928|362-en|en|wav/p362_210.wav|||What do you want to say?|
041929|362-en|en|wav/p362_211.wav|||I was so relieved.|
041930|362-en|en|wav/p362_212.wav|||They continue to do so.|
041931|362-en|en|wav/p362_213.wav|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
041932|362-en|en|wav/p362_214.wav|||It is a worry.|
041933|362-en|en|wav/p362_215.wav|||We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|
041934|362-en|en|wav/p362_216.wav|||That is highly unfair.|
041935|362-en|en|wav/p362_217.wav|||They are not the answer to staff shortages.|
041936|362-en|en|wav/p362_218.wav|||Gas is too expensive.|
041937|362-en|en|wav/p362_219.wav|||This plan is an agenda for action.|
041938|362-en|en|wav/p362_220.wav|||It was all relative.|
041939|362-en|en|wav/p362_221.wav|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
041940|362-en|en|wav/p362_222.wav|||Are you up for business?|
041941|362-en|en|wav/p362_223.wav|||It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|
041942|362-en|en|wav/p362_224.wav|||You are not in any kind of trouble.|
041943|362-en|en|wav/p362_225.wav|||It also makes for interesting viewing.|
041944|362-en|en|wav/p362_226.wav|||Life becomes a song.|
041945|362-en|en|wav/p362_227.wav|||No wonder he missed the conversion.|
041946|362-en|en|wav/p362_228.wav|||Sadly, they did not.|
041947|362-en|en|wav/p362_229.wav|||We have nowhere to go.|
041948|362-en|en|wav/p362_230.wav|||He has every right to do that.|
041949|362-en|en|wav/p362_231.wav|||Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|
041950|362-en|en|wav/p362_232.wav|||That had never happened.|
041951|362-en|en|wav/p362_233.wav|||However, our players will fight for that.|
041952|362-en|en|wav/p362_234.wav|||They are not suitable.|
041953|362-en|en|wav/p362_235.wav|||He is advised that he has done so.|
041954|362-en|en|wav/p362_236.wav|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
041955|362-en|en|wav/p362_237.wav|||He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|
041956|362-en|en|wav/p362_238.wav|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
041957|362-en|en|wav/p362_239.wav|||But the killing will continue.|
041958|362-en|en|wav/p362_240.wav|||They've got to get better.|
041959|362-en|en|wav/p362_241.wav|||But we are working together for this result.|
041960|362-en|en|wav/p362_242.wav|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
041961|362-en|en|wav/p362_243.wav|||It doesn't make them evil.|
041962|362-en|en|wav/p362_244.wav|||We don't want to be too intrusive.|
041963|362-en|en|wav/p362_245.wav|||The most important thing is the game.|
041964|362-en|en|wav/p362_246.wav|||He said nothing of the sort.|
041965|362-en|en|wav/p362_247.wav|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
041966|362-en|en|wav/p362_248.wav|||In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|
041967|362-en|en|wav/p362_249.wav|||The door is open.|
041968|362-en|en|wav/p362_250.wav|||Pulled a huge number of viewers.|
041969|362-en|en|wav/p362_251.wav|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
041970|362-en|en|wav/p362_252.wav|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
041971|362-en|en|wav/p362_253.wav|||So what went wrong?|
041972|362-en|en|wav/p362_254.wav|||We did not play well.|
041973|362-en|en|wav/p362_255.wav|||We are in a very strong position.|
041974|362-en|en|wav/p362_256.wav|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
041975|362-en|en|wav/p362_257.wav|||That is the key.|
041976|362-en|en|wav/p362_258.wav|||So, how did you do?|
041977|362-en|en|wav/p362_259.wav|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
041978|362-en|en|wav/p362_260.wav|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
041979|362-en|en|wav/p362_261.wav|||I can't deny that fact.|
041980|362-en|en|wav/p362_262.wav|||She is now planning a visit.|
041981|362-en|en|wav/p362_263.wav|||We could have done without this.|
041982|362-en|en|wav/p362_264.wav|||Boy is the town a mess.|
041983|362-en|en|wav/p362_265.wav|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
041984|362-en|en|wav/p362_266.wav|||He's a great dealer.|
041985|362-en|en|wav/p362_267.wav|||Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|
041986|362-en|en|wav/p362_268.wav|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
041987|362-en|en|wav/p362_269.wav|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
041988|362-en|en|wav/p362_270.wav|||We are moving on.|
041989|362-en|en|wav/p362_271.wav|||This is not a crisis.|
041990|362-en|en|wav/p362_272.wav|||There's always a chance.|
041991|362-en|en|wav/p362_273.wav|||I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|
041992|362-en|en|wav/p362_274.wav|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
041993|362-en|en|wav/p362_275.wav|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
041994|362-en|en|wav/p362_276.wav|||That's a very serious matter.|
041995|362-en|en|wav/p362_277.wav|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
041996|362-en|en|wav/p362_278.wav|||But it was to no avail.|
041997|362-en|en|wav/p362_279.wav|||Sad to say, it's still waiting.|
041998|362-en|en|wav/p362_280.wav|||It has been a major success.|
041999|362-en|en|wav/p362_281.wav|||It takes a bit of working out.|
042000|362-en|en|wav/p362_282.wav|||I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|
042001|362-en|en|wav/p362_283.wav|||But it didn't bother me.|
042002|362-en|en|wav/p362_284.wav|||I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|
042003|362-en|en|wav/p362_285.wav|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
042004|362-en|en|wav/p362_286.wav|||He will not be coming back.|
042005|362-en|en|wav/p362_287.wav|||He is also a great finisher.|
042006|362-en|en|wav/p362_288.wav|||I don't see any problem.|
042007|362-en|en|wav/p362_289.wav|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
042008|362-en|en|wav/p362_290.wav|||Yet it seemed to work.|
042009|362-en|en|wav/p362_291.wav|||Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|
042010|362-en|en|wav/p362_292.wav|||I have never felt so well.|
042011|362-en|en|wav/p362_293.wav|||There are other things going on.|
042012|362-en|en|wav/p362_294.wav|||All is now forgiven.|
042013|362-en|en|wav/p362_295.wav|||So who is right?|
042014|362-en|en|wav/p362_296.wav|||And this tournament will travel.|
042015|362-en|en|wav/p362_297.wav|||There will be new memories.|
042016|362-en|en|wav/p362_298.wav|||Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|
042017|362-en|en|wav/p362_299.wav|||We know the goals will come.|
042018|362-en|en|wav/p362_300.wav|||How can they get one?|
042019|362-en|en|wav/p362_301.wav|||It was an insult.|
042020|362-en|en|wav/p362_302.wav|||But we all have to look at ourselves.|
042021|362-en|en|wav/p362_303.wav|||We have nothing to hide.|
042022|362-en|en|wav/p362_304.wav|||He added, We are full of anger.|
042023|362-en|en|wav/p362_305.wav|||He did it all for us.|
042024|362-en|en|wav/p362_306.wav|||I don't think that is good enough.|
042025|362-en|en|wav/p362_307.wav|||Of course it is.|
042026|362-en|en|wav/p362_308.wav|||We all make mistakes.|
042027|362-en|en|wav/p362_309.wav|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
042028|362-en|en|wav/p362_310.wav|||That is my commitment.|
042029|362-en|en|wav/p362_311.wav|||This is the only problem with the story.|
042030|362-en|en|wav/p362_312.wav|||It is good football in Scotland.|
042031|362-en|en|wav/p362_313.wav|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
042032|362-en|en|wav/p362_314.wav|||Is that right?|
042033|362-en|en|wav/p362_315.wav|||So other options had to be explored.|
042034|362-en|en|wav/p362_316.wav|||They should be so lucky.|
042035|362-en|en|wav/p362_317.wav|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
042036|362-en|en|wav/p362_318.wav|||It is good news for us.|
042037|362-en|en|wav/p362_319.wav|||The timing is obvious.|
042038|362-en|en|wav/p362_320.wav|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
042039|362-en|en|wav/p362_321.wav|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
042040|362-en|en|wav/p362_322.wav|||I don't think it's very real.|
042041|362-en|en|wav/p362_323.wav|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
042042|362-en|en|wav/p362_324.wav|||I think she was right.|
042043|362-en|en|wav/p362_325.wav|||Is that what people want?|
042044|362-en|en|wav/p362_326.wav|||CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|
042045|362-en|en|wav/p362_327.wav|||I'd like to continue that record.|
042046|362-en|en|wav/p362_328.wav|||It will be a new experience.|
042047|362-en|en|wav/p362_329.wav|||The process itself has taken over.|
042048|362-en|en|wav/p362_330.wav|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
042049|362-en|en|wav/p362_331.wav|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
042050|362-en|en|wav/p362_332.wav|||It is quite hard to track.|
042051|362-en|en|wav/p362_333.wav|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042052|362-en|en|wav/p362_334.wav|||But his attendance is not guaranteed.|
042053|362-en|en|wav/p362_335.wav|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
042054|362-en|en|wav/p362_336.wav|||I am sure all schools would accept that.|
042055|362-en|en|wav/p362_337.wav|||It was quite an ordeal for them.|
042056|362-en|en|wav/p362_338.wav|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
042057|362-en|en|wav/p362_339.wav|||Doesn't matter what you do.|
042058|362-en|en|wav/p362_340.wav|||O no it's not!|
042059|362-en|en|wav/p362_341.wav|||The result could be all down to turnout.|
042060|362-en|en|wav/p362_342.wav|||They are in good spirits.|
042061|362-en|en|wav/p362_343.wav|||Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|
042062|362-en|en|wav/p362_344.wav|||He was their leader.|
042063|362-en|en|wav/p362_345.wav|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
042064|362-en|en|wav/p362_346.wav|||So far he has not done so.|
042065|362-en|en|wav/p362_347.wav|||Maybe they will show it next year.|
042066|362-en|en|wav/p362_348.wav|||They are a very good team.|
042067|362-en|en|wav/p362_349.wav|||So there we are.|
042068|362-en|en|wav/p362_350.wav|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
042069|362-en|en|wav/p362_351.wav|||It doesn't make me feel any better.|
042070|362-en|en|wav/p362_352.wav|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
042071|362-en|en|wav/p362_353.wav|||The incident is dead.|
042072|362-en|en|wav/p362_354.wav|||We are delighted with the result.|
042073|362-en|en|wav/p362_355.wav|||It will take time.|
042074|362-en|en|wav/p362_356.wav|||They will do something big.|
042075|362-en|en|wav/p362_357.wav|||The programme was awful.|
042076|362-en|en|wav/p362_358.wav|||It is having a big impact.|
042077|362-en|en|wav/p362_359.wav|||That is very hard, alone.|
042078|362-en|en|wav/p362_360.wav|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042079|362-en|en|wav/p362_361.wav|||Doesn't he miss it?|
042080|362-en|en|wav/p362_362.wav|||The same goes for Russia.|
042081|362-en|en|wav/p362_363.wav|||They went down together.|
042082|362-en|en|wav/p362_364.wav|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
042083|362-en|en|wav/p362_365.wav|||One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|
042084|362-en|en|wav/p362_366.wav|||We were getting very worried.|
042085|362-en|en|wav/p362_367.wav|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
042086|362-en|en|wav/p362_368.wav|||You can't really compare.|
042087|362-en|en|wav/p362_369.wav|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
042088|362-en|en|wav/p362_370.wav|||Plot is not the issue.|
042089|362-en|en|wav/p362_371.wav|||We need to increase the membership.|
042090|362-en|en|wav/p362_372.wav|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
042091|362-en|en|wav/p362_373.wav|||We should not be complacent.|
042092|362-en|en|wav/p362_374.wav|||We all want the same things.|
042093|362-en|en|wav/p362_375.wav|||Maybe his time has gone.|
042094|362-en|en|wav/p362_376.wav|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
042095|362-en|en|wav/p362_377.wav|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
042096|362-en|en|wav/p362_378.wav|||SO, that is it for another year.|
042097|362-en|en|wav/p362_379.wav|||The results are tragic.|
042098|362-en|en|wav/p362_380.wav|||We are not getting him back.|
042099|362-en|en|wav/p362_381.wav|||He was on a horse.|
042100|362-en|en|wav/p362_382.wav|||Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
042101|362-en|en|wav/p362_383.wav|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
042102|362-en|en|wav/p362_384.wav|||There may be reasons for it.|
042103|362-en|en|wav/p362_385.wav|||He had taken everything from me.|
042104|362-en|en|wav/p362_386.wav|||It's a good offer by any standards.|
042105|362-en|en|wav/p362_387.wav|||Yes, it took time to recover.|
042106|362-en|en|wav/p362_388.wav|||The potential is always in the idea.|
042107|362-en|en|wav/p362_389.wav|||I am not a frustrated actor.|
042108|362-en|en|wav/p362_390.wav|||No progress has been made.|
042109|362-en|en|wav/p362_391.wav|||He can win every week.|
042110|362-en|en|wav/p362_392.wav|||This makes up for it.|
042111|362-en|en|wav/p362_393.wav|||My mind was made up.|
042112|362-en|en|wav/p362_394.wav|||The plot is changing as time goes on.|
042113|362-en|en|wav/p362_395.wav|||I never got anything out of it.|
042114|362-en|en|wav/p362_396.wav|||It is patently true.|
042115|362-en|en|wav/p362_397.wav|||Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|
042116|362-en|en|wav/p362_398.wav|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
042117|362-en|en|wav/p362_399.wav|||That is why he is so special.|
042118|362-en|en|wav/p362_400.wav|||You hope he prevails.|
042119|362-en|en|wav/p362_401.wav|||My mother was getting on at me.|
042120|362-en|en|wav/p362_402.wav|||This is a very serious matter.|
042121|362-en|en|wav/p362_403.wav|||It's going to be great!|
042122|362-en|en|wav/p362_404.wav|||That's a good sign.|
042123|362-en|en|wav/p362_405.wav|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
042124|362-en|en|wav/p362_406.wav|||He added that he felt undermined.|
042125|362-en|en|wav/p362_407.wav|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
042126|362-en|en|wav/p362_408.wav|||He declined to be more specific.|
042127|362-en|en|wav/p362_409.wav|||But it looks good for next year.|
042128|362-en|en|wav/p362_410.wav|||Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|
042129|362-en|en|wav/p362_411.wav|||We want everyone to have a good time.|
042130|362-en|en|wav/p362_412.wav|||We're going to rebuild.|
042131|362-en|en|wav/p362_413.wav|||We are trying to do it properly.|
042132|362-en|en|wav/p362_414.wav|||We actually had a laugh about that.|
042133|362-en|en|wav/p362_415.wav|||It raises the edge.|
042134|362-en|en|wav/p362_416.wav|||He is wanted by German police for questioning.|
042135|362-en|en|wav/p362_417.wav|||I had no idea.|
042136|362-en|en|wav/p362_418.wav|||As indeed it did.|
042137|362-en|en|wav/p362_419.wav|||We made a world record together.|
042138|362-en|en|wav/p362_420.wav|||They were outside the circle.|
042139|362-en|en|wav/p362_421.wav|||I want to help other women.|
042140|362-en|en|wav/p362_422.wav|||He got the part.|
042141|362-en|en|wav/p362_423.wav|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
042142|362-en|en|wav/p362_424.wav|||He refused to name the survivors.|
042143|363-en|en|wav/p363_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
042144|363-en|en|wav/p363_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042145|363-en|en|wav/p363_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042146|363-en|en|wav/p363_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042147|363-en|en|wav/p363_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042148|363-en|en|wav/p363_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042149|363-en|en|wav/p363_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042150|363-en|en|wav/p363_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042151|363-en|en|wav/p363_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042152|363-en|en|wav/p363_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042153|363-en|en|wav/p363_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042154|363-en|en|wav/p363_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042155|363-en|en|wav/p363_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042156|363-en|en|wav/p363_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042157|363-en|en|wav/p363_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042158|363-en|en|wav/p363_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042159|363-en|en|wav/p363_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042160|363-en|en|wav/p363_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042161|363-en|en|wav/p363_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042162|363-en|en|wav/p363_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042163|363-en|en|wav/p363_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042164|363-en|en|wav/p363_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042165|363-en|en|wav/p363_023.wav|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042166|363-en|en|wav/p363_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042167|363-en|en|wav/p363_025.wav|||It's never been to committee.|
042168|363-en|en|wav/p363_026.wav|||Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|
042169|363-en|en|wav/p363_027.wav|||It was actually very, very difficult.|
042170|363-en|en|wav/p363_028.wav|||The proposals were not new.|
042171|363-en|en|wav/p363_029.wav|||He scored one goal and was on fire.|
042172|363-en|en|wav/p363_030.wav|||His party never arrived.|
042173|363-en|en|wav/p363_031.wav|||Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.|
042174|363-en|en|wav/p363_032.wav|||If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.|
042175|363-en|en|wav/p363_033.wav|||He gave no other details.|
042176|363-en|en|wav/p363_034.wav|||It's not an improvement for him.|
042177|363-en|en|wav/p363_035.wav|||I think it is wide open.|
042178|363-en|en|wav/p363_036.wav|||It certainly is cause for concern.|
042179|363-en|en|wav/p363_037.wav|||It's on with a roller.|
042180|363-en|en|wav/p363_038.wav|||The captaincy will help that, too.|
042181|363-en|en|wav/p363_039.wav|||That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.|
042182|363-en|en|wav/p363_040.wav|||I think we're a long way forward.|
042183|363-en|en|wav/p363_041.wav|||The impact was immediate.|
042184|363-en|en|wav/p363_042.wav|||There is a new confidence about the club.|
042185|363-en|en|wav/p363_043.wav|||His film is not.|
042186|363-en|en|wav/p363_044.wav|||It is the strength of the school.|
042187|363-en|en|wav/p363_045.wav|||In my experience, he does not do that.|
042188|363-en|en|wav/p363_046.wav|||That is good news.|
042189|363-en|en|wav/p363_047.wav|||This has come as a shock to everyone.|
042190|363-en|en|wav/p363_048.wav|||He will never be forgotten.|
042191|363-en|en|wav/p363_049.wav|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
042192|363-en|en|wav/p363_050.wav|||He was very grateful for his health.|
042193|363-en|en|wav/p363_051.wav|||The nation has his music.|
042194|363-en|en|wav/p363_052.wav|||But real life is not like that.|
042195|363-en|en|wav/p363_053.wav|||So now we know.|
042196|363-en|en|wav/p363_054.wav|||That is why this action has been taken.|
042197|363-en|en|wav/p363_055.wav|||Who will pay for this?|
042198|363-en|en|wav/p363_056.wav|||The defender should have won the bloody ba.|
042199|363-en|en|wav/p363_057.wav|||There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.|
042200|363-en|en|wav/p363_058.wav|||We were upset about the referee.|
042201|363-en|en|wav/p363_059.wav|||That is our objective.|
042202|363-en|en|wav/p363_060.wav|||What's the problem?|
042203|363-en|en|wav/p363_061.wav|||He is not alone.|
042204|363-en|en|wav/p363_062.wav|||He did that last Sunday.|
042205|363-en|en|wav/p363_063.wav|||There wasn't anything in it.|
042206|363-en|en|wav/p363_064.wav|||The club is afflicted by injuries.|
042207|363-en|en|wav/p363_065.wav|||Sentencing is also being considered in that review.|
042208|363-en|en|wav/p363_066.wav|||Lovely day isn't it?|
042209|363-en|en|wav/p363_067.wav|||It was far from business as usual.|
042210|363-en|en|wav/p363_068.wav|||Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|
042211|363-en|en|wav/p363_069.wav|||The show is not over.|
042212|363-en|en|wav/p363_070.wav|||Saddam Hussein is a devil.|
042213|363-en|en|wav/p363_071.wav|||This is a judgment issue.|
042214|363-en|en|wav/p363_072.wav|||Thirty people have applied for his job!|
042215|363-en|en|wav/p363_073.wav|||It was just an accident.|
042216|363-en|en|wav/p363_074.wav|||We are not commenting at the moment.|
042217|363-en|en|wav/p363_075.wav|||Today we must not repeat that mistake.|
042218|363-en|en|wav/p363_076.wav|||Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.|
042219|363-en|en|wav/p363_077.wav|||He is slightly confused.|
042220|363-en|en|wav/p363_078.wav|||We did not deserve to go through.|
042221|363-en|en|wav/p363_079.wav|||The course has helped a lot.|
042222|363-en|en|wav/p363_080.wav|||All the time, that number was coming down and down.|
042223|363-en|en|wav/p363_081.wav|||There is room for me.|
042224|363-en|en|wav/p363_082.wav|||That can only be a good thing.|
042225|363-en|en|wav/p363_083.wav|||I have never seen anything like this.|
042226|363-en|en|wav/p363_084.wav|||They are difficult awards to decide.|
042227|363-en|en|wav/p363_085.wav|||It was that kind of war.|
042228|363-en|en|wav/p363_086.wav|||That is my preference.|
042229|363-en|en|wav/p363_087.wav|||He later told The Herald, It is true.|
042230|363-en|en|wav/p363_088.wav|||It has come a long way since then.|
042231|363-en|en|wav/p363_089.wav|||It was decided he should be dismissed.|
042232|363-en|en|wav/p363_090.wav|||But someone has got to do it.|
042233|363-en|en|wav/p363_091.wav|||We have not given up.|
042234|363-en|en|wav/p363_092.wav|||It was the turning point of the afternoon.|
042235|363-en|en|wav/p363_093.wav|||I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|
042236|363-en|en|wav/p363_094.wav|||What has happened?|
042237|363-en|en|wav/p363_095.wav|||If they are not, the commission will take action.|
042238|363-en|en|wav/p363_096.wav|||Where will the money come from?|
042239|363-en|en|wav/p363_097.wav|||She is still very poorly.|
042240|363-en|en|wav/p363_098.wav|||It was good fun.|
042241|363-en|en|wav/p363_099.wav|||This is a great shame.|
042242|363-en|en|wav/p363_100.wav|||We talk about effective military action.|
042243|363-en|en|wav/p363_101.wav|||I can't get it.|
042244|363-en|en|wav/p363_102.wav|||It was entirely justified.|
042245|363-en|en|wav/p363_103.wav|||He demanded to speak to the boss.|
042246|363-en|en|wav/p363_104.wav|||It's somewhere in between.|
042247|363-en|en|wav/p363_105.wav|||The play was to go straight ahead.|
042248|363-en|en|wav/p363_106.wav|||He had never run the distance before.|
042249|363-en|en|wav/p363_107.wav|||I am the head.|
042250|363-en|en|wav/p363_108.wav|||He is obviously very dangerous.|
042251|363-en|en|wav/p363_109.wav|||It can be very worrying.|
042252|363-en|en|wav/p363_110.wav|||It's harder, believe me.|
042253|363-en|en|wav/p363_111.wav|||We are making no comment.|
042254|363-en|en|wav/p363_112.wav|||I sit at home a lot.|
042255|363-en|en|wav/p363_113.wav|||That was certainly the case for the parties.|
042256|363-en|en|wav/p363_114.wav|||I hope the couples are still together.|
042257|363-en|en|wav/p363_115.wav|||We have learned a tremendous amount.|
042258|363-en|en|wav/p363_116.wav|||But that is not enough.|
042259|363-en|en|wav/p363_117.wav|||These people are helpless.|
042260|363-en|en|wav/p363_118.wav|||I wish him well.|
042261|363-en|en|wav/p363_119.wav|||Only the details have to be sorted out.|
042262|363-en|en|wav/p363_120.wav|||It would be really interesting if they did.|
042263|363-en|en|wav/p363_121.wav|||That takes a lot of courage.|
042264|363-en|en|wav/p363_122.wav|||Sadly, it is not to be.|
042265|363-en|en|wav/p363_123.wav|||Motorists will welcome this.|
042266|363-en|en|wav/p363_124.wav|||I welcome this Bill.|
042267|363-en|en|wav/p363_125.wav|||This is not a problem.|
042268|363-en|en|wav/p363_126.wav|||he announced his plans.|
042269|363-en|en|wav/p363_127.wav|||He is the man to beat.|
042270|363-en|en|wav/p363_128.wav|||We are getting not a penny.|
042271|363-en|en|wav/p363_129.wav|||Look at the turn-out.|
042272|363-en|en|wav/p363_130.wav|||Which brings us to the question of money.|
042273|363-en|en|wav/p363_131.wav|||It is very simple.|
042274|363-en|en|wav/p363_132.wav|||There was something special about that.|
042275|363-en|en|wav/p363_133.wav|||Many other areas are coming up.|
042276|363-en|en|wav/p363_134.wav|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
042277|363-en|en|wav/p363_135.wav|||There were no reports of casualties.|
042278|363-en|en|wav/p363_136.wav|||But it's a subtle process.|
042279|363-en|en|wav/p363_137.wav|||She didn't tell me anything the night before.|
042280|363-en|en|wav/p363_138.wav|||I will be having talks with the workforce.|
042281|363-en|en|wav/p363_139.wav|||Changes need to be made.|
042282|363-en|en|wav/p363_140.wav|||Things are going well.|
042283|363-en|en|wav/p363_141.wav|||Hard it will be.|
042284|363-en|en|wav/p363_142.wav|||I was deeply worried.|
042285|363-en|en|wav/p363_143.wav|||Maybe it will work there.|
042286|363-en|en|wav/p363_144.wav|||How does it all work?|
042287|363-en|en|wav/p363_145.wav|||We could easily have lost that game.|
042288|363-en|en|wav/p363_146.wav|||There's a lot of it going on.|
042289|363-en|en|wav/p363_147.wav|||I doubt it would be genuine.|
042290|363-en|en|wav/p363_148.wav|||It would be a masterclass.|
042291|363-en|en|wav/p363_149.wav|||It would have been a very explosive issue.|
042292|363-en|en|wav/p363_150.wav|||I didn't really expect to be called up.|
042293|363-en|en|wav/p363_151.wav|||They will not be going back.|
042294|363-en|en|wav/p363_152.wav|||The progress has been steady.|
042295|363-en|en|wav/p363_153.wav|||It has no chance.|
042296|363-en|en|wav/p363_154.wav|||His body was never found.|
042297|363-en|en|wav/p363_155.wav|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
042298|363-en|en|wav/p363_156.wav|||We have been extremely busy.|
042299|363-en|en|wav/p363_157.wav|||It appears to have been successful.|
042300|363-en|en|wav/p363_158.wav|||This is a big game for them.|
042301|363-en|en|wav/p363_159.wav|||We still have to wait for that.|
042302|363-en|en|wav/p363_160.wav|||He said it was his greatest work.|
042303|363-en|en|wav/p363_161.wav|||I feel a little betrayed.|
042304|363-en|en|wav/p363_162.wav|||The baby deserves the credit.|
042305|363-en|en|wav/p363_163.wav|||I live for today.|
042306|363-en|en|wav/p363_164.wav|||I have been very stupid.|
042307|363-en|en|wav/p363_165.wav|||I always savour the company of The Voice.|
042308|363-en|en|wav/p363_166.wav|||My father and mother are.|
042309|363-en|en|wav/p363_167.wav|||But that was his nature.|
042310|363-en|en|wav/p363_168.wav|||We have been together for five years.|
042311|363-en|en|wav/p363_169.wav|||They would never let him go.|
042312|363-en|en|wav/p363_170.wav|||So what's in store?|
042313|363-en|en|wav/p363_171.wav|||He didn't know where to look.|
042314|363-en|en|wav/p363_172.wav|||The German had a point to make.|
042315|363-en|en|wav/p363_173.wav|||There are two characters.|
042316|363-en|en|wav/p363_174.wav|||The only trouble is finding them.|
042317|363-en|en|wav/p363_175.wav|||Scotland won by six wickets.|
042318|363-en|en|wav/p363_176.wav|||Her body has never been found.|
042319|363-en|en|wav/p363_177.wav|||It is all credit to them today.|
042320|363-en|en|wav/p363_178.wav|||That was a huge experience.|
042321|363-en|en|wav/p363_179.wav|||Perhaps it was just as well.|
042322|363-en|en|wav/p363_180.wav|||Will he be here for the weekend?|
042323|363-en|en|wav/p363_181.wav|||He can do everything.|
042324|363-en|en|wav/p363_182.wav|||Now is the time for action.|
042325|363-en|en|wav/p363_183.wav|||Public safety is paramount.|
042326|363-en|en|wav/p363_184.wav|||I feel really confident in that department.|
042327|363-en|en|wav/p363_185.wav|||They were not consulted.|
042328|363-en|en|wav/p363_186.wav|||He had an apartment ready.|
042329|363-en|en|wav/p363_187.wav|||The prime minister will make the decision.|
042330|363-en|en|wav/p363_188.wav|||THERE's only one word for it.|
042331|363-en|en|wav/p363_189.wav|||We're trying to get rounded performers.|
042332|363-en|en|wav/p363_190.wav|||It was far more important than that.|
042333|363-en|en|wav/p363_191.wav|||That is European law.|
042334|363-en|en|wav/p363_192.wav|||Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.|
042335|363-en|en|wav/p363_193.wav|||Their appeal will be heard this week.|
042336|363-en|en|wav/p363_194.wav|||Their own instinctive response was confirmed.|
042337|363-en|en|wav/p363_195.wav|||Why is he not fighting for the Union?|
042338|363-en|en|wav/p363_196.wav|||A decision is expected tomorrow.|
042339|363-en|en|wav/p363_197.wav|||I wanted to get on with it.|
042340|363-en|en|wav/p363_198.wav|||I don't think it's the area.|
042341|363-en|en|wav/p363_199.wav|||Well, you might have a point.|
042342|363-en|en|wav/p363_200.wav|||It was a horrible moment.|
042343|363-en|en|wav/p363_201.wav|||It was quite distressing for the crew.|
042344|363-en|en|wav/p363_202.wav|||Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.|
042345|363-en|en|wav/p363_203.wav|||I really had to concentrate.|
042346|363-en|en|wav/p363_204.wav|||We didn't want any trouble.|
042347|363-en|en|wav/p363_205.wav|||Frankly, they have to crack down.|
042348|363-en|en|wav/p363_206.wav|||The training will take place in Downing Street.|
042349|363-en|en|wav/p363_207.wav|||We have still got the fight in us.|
042350|363-en|en|wav/p363_208.wav|||That decision is now being appealed.|
042351|363-en|en|wav/p363_209.wav|||This is really good news for us.|
042352|363-en|en|wav/p363_210.wav|||I wanted to have a go.|
042353|363-en|en|wav/p363_211.wav|||A senior party insider said.|
042354|363-en|en|wav/p363_212.wav|||We got on very well.|
042355|363-en|en|wav/p363_213.wav|||I think it must be the uniforms.|
042356|363-en|en|wav/p363_214.wav|||This is not a monument to the past.|
042357|363-en|en|wav/p363_215.wav|||We can all understand that.|
042358|363-en|en|wav/p363_216.wav|||You are going to have to do it.|
042359|363-en|en|wav/p363_217.wav|||I was amazed at her knowledge.|
042360|363-en|en|wav/p363_218.wav|||Where is the evidence?|
042361|363-en|en|wav/p363_219.wav|||It was important in training terms.|
042362|363-en|en|wav/p363_220.wav|||Ours is on for two days.|
042363|363-en|en|wav/p363_221.wav|||We don't want that at all.|
042364|363-en|en|wav/p363_222.wav|||Her appeal is to be heard this week.|
042365|363-en|en|wav/p363_223.wav|||The group will report back in the summer.|
042366|363-en|en|wav/p363_224.wav|||Among them is his beloved teacher.|
042367|363-en|en|wav/p363_225.wav|||We don't come here for our health.|
042368|363-en|en|wav/p363_226.wav|||That in itself is a joke.|
042369|363-en|en|wav/p363_227.wav|||They know nothing about the sport.|
042370|363-en|en|wav/p363_228.wav|||But we shall have to talk to him.|
042371|363-en|en|wav/p363_229.wav|||Well, we know now.|
042372|363-en|en|wav/p363_230.wav|||He was only doing his job.|
042373|363-en|en|wav/p363_231.wav|||They chose the latter.|
042374|363-en|en|wav/p363_232.wav|||The legal process could last weeks.|
042375|363-en|en|wav/p363_233.wav|||All were later allowed home.|
042376|363-en|en|wav/p363_234.wav|||I can do this on my own.|
042377|363-en|en|wav/p363_235.wav|||Will you just put it away?|
042378|363-en|en|wav/p363_236.wav|||I think it's more important to have fun.|
042379|363-en|en|wav/p363_237.wav|||By then it was too late.|
042380|363-en|en|wav/p363_238.wav|||I am very sorry to hear about this.|
042381|363-en|en|wav/p363_239.wav|||I'm so looking forward to it.|
042382|363-en|en|wav/p363_240.wav|||I think we can do well.|
042383|363-en|en|wav/p363_241.wav|||That ignorance is crucial.|
042384|363-en|en|wav/p363_242.wav|||It was an excellent performance.|
042385|363-en|en|wav/p363_243.wav|||It is also claimed that he was murdered.|
042386|363-en|en|wav/p363_244.wav|||Clearly, there was a mix-up.|
042387|363-en|en|wav/p363_245.wav|||I have not had much of him.|
042388|363-en|en|wav/p363_246.wav|||Sub Not Used, MacKay.|
042389|363-en|en|wav/p363_247.wav|||We are taking no chances this time.|
042390|363-en|en|wav/p363_248.wav|||He is to be commended.|
042391|363-en|en|wav/p363_249.wav|||I can hardly believe it.|
042392|363-en|en|wav/p363_250.wav|||The goals will come.|
042393|363-en|en|wav/p363_251.wav|||I don't feel like working.|
042394|363-en|en|wav/p363_252.wav|||Then one day it happened.|
042395|363-en|en|wav/p363_253.wav|||I sit in the car.|
042396|363-en|en|wav/p363_254.wav|||We stopped at half-time.|
042397|363-en|en|wav/p363_255.wav|||I was brought up in a mining background.|
042398|363-en|en|wav/p363_256.wav|||All winners should be tested.|
042399|363-en|en|wav/p363_257.wav|||We would like to see them in court.|
042400|363-en|en|wav/p363_258.wav|||I thought his speech was a disgrace.|
042401|363-en|en|wav/p363_259.wav|||It is not a soap opera.|
042402|363-en|en|wav/p363_260.wav|||Whatever we do, we know we can do well.|
042403|363-en|en|wav/p363_261.wav|||They may not always be so lucky.|
042404|363-en|en|wav/p363_262.wav|||Where was the point in all this?|
042405|363-en|en|wav/p363_263.wav|||He was travelling to see his daughter.|
042406|363-en|en|wav/p363_264.wav|||It's an hour of the same response.|
042407|363-en|en|wav/p363_265.wav|||This is the root of their problems.|
042408|363-en|en|wav/p363_266.wav|||Two other men have recovered.|
042409|363-en|en|wav/p363_267.wav|||It will be a challenging film.|
042410|363-en|en|wav/p363_268.wav|||The test case is still awaiting action.|
042411|363-en|en|wav/p363_269.wav|||She is under police escort.|
042412|363-en|en|wav/p363_270.wav|||However, that is not in itself enough.|
042413|363-en|en|wav/p363_271.wav|||That should not be their conclusion.|
042414|363-en|en|wav/p363_272.wav|||We're going to fight it.|
042415|363-en|en|wav/p363_273.wav|||The plot is minimal.|
042416|363-en|en|wav/p363_274.wav|||His funeral is not expected until next week.|
042417|363-en|en|wav/p363_275.wav|||Now we have had enough.|
042418|363-en|en|wav/p363_276.wav|||Can you believe it?|
042419|363-en|en|wav/p363_277.wav|||He is certainly not looking for another job.|
042420|363-en|en|wav/p363_278.wav|||I have a problem with these things.|
042421|363-en|en|wav/p363_280.wav|||The gap is closing.|
042422|363-en|en|wav/p363_281.wav|||Then there was her childhood.|
042423|363-en|en|wav/p363_282.wav|||Other people had looked at it.|
042424|363-en|en|wav/p363_283.wav|||And the other winners are.|
042425|363-en|en|wav/p363_284.wav|||It was quite a sight.|
042426|363-en|en|wav/p363_285.wav|||But he was far from alone.|
042427|363-en|en|wav/p363_286.wav|||We have got no money to go anywhere.|
042428|363-en|en|wav/p363_287.wav|||I believe he could have turned it around.|
042429|363-en|en|wav/p363_288.wav|||The Believer isn't just a movie.|
042430|363-en|en|wav/p363_289.wav|||You are looking at him.|
042431|363-en|en|wav/p363_290.wav|||The best team won.|
042432|363-en|en|wav/p363_291.wav|||It being the weekend, there was no-one there.|
042433|363-en|en|wav/p363_292.wav|||It was an achievement all right.|
042434|363-en|en|wav/p363_293.wav|||They think that it matters but it doesn't.|
042435|363-en|en|wav/p363_294.wav|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
042436|363-en|en|wav/p363_295.wav|||It should be equal.|
042437|363-en|en|wav/p363_296.wav|||It will make a big difference.|
042438|363-en|en|wav/p363_297.wav|||I want to make a difference.|
042439|363-en|en|wav/p363_298.wav|||What was the cause of all this outrage?|
042440|363-en|en|wav/p363_299.wav|||He will have it within two weeks.|
042441|363-en|en|wav/p363_300.wav|||How do you feel?|
042442|363-en|en|wav/p363_301.wav|||It is a terrible state of affairs.|
042443|363-en|en|wav/p363_302.wav|||It was not the right time for me.|
042444|363-en|en|wav/p363_303.wav|||But they have the sound.|
042445|363-en|en|wav/p363_304.wav|||Not all women are dismayed.|
042446|363-en|en|wav/p363_305.wav|||There will have to be a full inquiry.|
042447|363-en|en|wav/p363_306.wav|||It is not just in Edinburgh.|
042448|363-en|en|wav/p363_307.wav|||It's never happened before.|
042449|363-en|en|wav/p363_308.wav|||It was a deeper deception.|
042450|363-en|en|wav/p363_309.wav|||Norton was delighted with his successes.|
042451|363-en|en|wav/p363_310.wav|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
042452|363-en|en|wav/p363_311.wav|||There is another side to it.|
042453|363-en|en|wav/p363_312.wav|||His remit is specific.|
042454|363-en|en|wav/p363_313.wav|||It will be very damaging for research.|
042455|363-en|en|wav/p363_314.wav|||I'm a bit overwhelmed.|
042456|363-en|en|wav/p363_315.wav|||The Old Firm are growing.|
042457|363-en|en|wav/p363_316.wav|||They want to win the title.|
042458|363-en|en|wav/p363_317.wav|||Her concerns were not without foundation.|
042459|363-en|en|wav/p363_318.wav|||This decision is a farce.|
042460|363-en|en|wav/p363_319.wav|||That would be the constructive way forward.|
042461|363-en|en|wav/p363_320.wav|||My view has now completely changed.|
042462|363-en|en|wav/p363_321.wav|||It was blown out of proportion.|
042463|363-en|en|wav/p363_322.wav|||You have no chance of planning permission.|
042464|363-en|en|wav/p363_323.wav|||That is taking place in Strathclyde.|
042465|363-en|en|wav/p363_324.wav|||He was in a mood.|
042466|363-en|en|wav/p363_325.wav|||Was this element always there?|
042467|363-en|en|wav/p363_326.wav|||This is an awful lot of money.|
042468|363-en|en|wav/p363_327.wav|||He was the architect.|
042469|363-en|en|wav/p363_328.wav|||The United Nations must act.|
042470|363-en|en|wav/p363_329.wav|||They haven't got a hope.|
042471|363-en|en|wav/p363_330.wav|||He was a national treasure.|
042472|363-en|en|wav/p363_331.wav|||I think they are right to be impatient.|
042473|363-en|en|wav/p363_332.wav|||We need to regroup.|
042474|363-en|en|wav/p363_333.wav|||I must make that clear.|
042475|363-en|en|wav/p363_334.wav|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
042476|363-en|en|wav/p363_335.wav|||I've never regretted coming here.|
042477|363-en|en|wav/p363_336.wav|||He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.|
042478|363-en|en|wav/p363_337.wav|||I just had to go for it.|
042479|363-en|en|wav/p363_338.wav|||It seems to go down well.|
042480|363-en|en|wav/p363_339.wav|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042481|363-en|en|wav/p363_341.wav|||I don't know, really.|
042482|363-en|en|wav/p363_343.wav|||Therefore there is a threat.|
042483|363-en|en|wav/p363_344.wav|||She would love it.|
042484|363-en|en|wav/p363_345.wav|||One was taken to hospital.|
042485|363-en|en|wav/p363_346.wav|||You did not see it.|
042486|363-en|en|wav/p363_347.wav|||Gritty he did not want.|
042487|363-en|en|wav/p363_348.wav|||The world is being invited to visit.|
042488|363-en|en|wav/p363_349.wav|||Nobody was able to escape.|
042489|363-en|en|wav/p363_350.wav|||Surely the answer is yes.|
042490|363-en|en|wav/p363_351.wav|||Secondly, there is the question of money.|
042491|363-en|en|wav/p363_352.wav|||He was later deported.|
042492|363-en|en|wav/p363_353.wav|||I only found out about it this morning.|
042493|363-en|en|wav/p363_354.wav|||I am not sure.|
042494|363-en|en|wav/p363_355.wav|||One might think that it is a power.|
042495|363-en|en|wav/p363_356.wav|||This place is outstanding.|
042496|363-en|en|wav/p363_357.wav|||Obviously we want to stop the rot.|
042497|363-en|en|wav/p363_358.wav|||But it is a fact.|
042498|363-en|en|wav/p363_359.wav|||They never seem to do anything about it.|
042499|363-en|en|wav/p363_360.wav|||We're going to sleep.|
042500|363-en|en|wav/p363_361.wav|||It raises a serious question mark.|
042501|363-en|en|wav/p363_362.wav|||The work with Alison was a great experience.|
042502|363-en|en|wav/p363_363.wav|||It was great fun.|
042503|363-en|en|wav/p363_364.wav|||Experience in this work is paramount.|
042504|363-en|en|wav/p363_365.wav|||It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.|
042505|363-en|en|wav/p363_366.wav|||It is not needed, it should go.|
042506|363-en|en|wav/p363_367.wav|||She had not suffered any physical injury.|
042507|363-en|en|wav/p363_368.wav|||We have a business to run.|
042508|363-en|en|wav/p363_369.wav|||We have been overwhelmed by the response.|
042509|363-en|en|wav/p363_370.wav|||And there are others.|
042510|363-en|en|wav/p363_371.wav|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
042511|363-en|en|wav/p363_372.wav|||I think we did well.|
042512|363-en|en|wav/p363_373.wav|||Only two things are certain.|
042513|363-en|en|wav/p363_374.wav|||There is nothing to fear.|
042514|363-en|en|wav/p363_375.wav|||Just look at his record.|
042515|363-en|en|wav/p363_376.wav|||He was a legend.|
042516|363-en|en|wav/p363_377.wav|||It is a memorial.|
042517|363-en|en|wav/p363_378.wav|||I have no evidence.|
042518|363-en|en|wav/p363_379.wav|||But is he?|
042519|363-en|en|wav/p363_380.wav|||We were very unhappy with the incident.|
042520|363-en|en|wav/p363_381.wav|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
042521|363-en|en|wav/p363_382.wav|||It is something that we would support.|
042522|363-en|en|wav/p363_383.wav|||It was a double tragedy for the family.|
042523|363-en|en|wav/p363_384.wav|||We are in shock.|
042524|363-en|en|wav/p363_385.wav|||Does it really matter?|
042525|363-en|en|wav/p363_386.wav|||I loved it - and so did my friend.|
042526|363-en|en|wav/p363_387.wav|||A decision is expected today.|
042527|363-en|en|wav/p363_388.wav|||I am enjoying it.|
042528|363-en|en|wav/p363_389.wav|||It wasn't very pretty to watch.|
042529|363-en|en|wav/p363_390.wav|||You have to go for it.|
042530|363-en|en|wav/p363_391.wav|||Are these immoral?|
042531|363-en|en|wav/p363_392.wav|||It has been a massive success.|
042532|363-en|en|wav/p363_393.wav|||It is for the same reason.|
042533|363-en|en|wav/p363_394.wav|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
042534|363-en|en|wav/p363_395.wav|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
042535|363-en|en|wav/p363_396.wav|||He will have something to say.|
042536|363-en|en|wav/p363_397.wav|||You can't take a chance.|
042537|363-en|en|wav/p363_398.wav|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
042538|363-en|en|wav/p363_399.wav|||There is a lack of logic.|
042539|363-en|en|wav/p363_401.wav|||We are about to have our own Parliament.|
042540|363-en|en|wav/p363_402.wav|||I am desperate to play for Scotland.|
042541|363-en|en|wav/p363_403.wav|||It is a large number.|
042542|363-en|en|wav/p363_404.wav|||She doesn't know where to begin.|
042543|363-en|en|wav/p363_405.wav|||This is your chance.|
042544|363-en|en|wav/p363_406.wav|||I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.|
042545|363-en|en|wav/p363_407.wav|||There's nothing she can't do.|
042546|363-en|en|wav/p363_408.wav|||Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.|
042547|363-en|en|wav/p363_409.wav|||I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.|
042548|363-en|en|wav/p363_410.wav|||Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|
042549|363-en|en|wav/p363_411.wav|||He died in September.|
042550|363-en|en|wav/p363_412.wav|||It was not even this century.|
042551|363-en|en|wav/p363_413.wav|||That was really tough.|
042552|363-en|en|wav/p363_414.wav|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042553|363-en|en|wav/p363_415.wav|||I am happy with my form.|
042554|363-en|en|wav/p363_416.wav|||That's the name of the game, though.|
042555|363-en|en|wav/p363_417.wav|||With him are the symbols of his faith.|
042556|363-en|en|wav/p363_418.wav|||Overall, it has certainly worked out.|
042557|363-en|en|wav/p363_419.wav|||This is actually true.|
042558|363-en|en|wav/p363_420.wav|||Both were reduced to rubble.|
042559|363-en|en|wav/p363_421.wav|||It could have taken another two months.|
042560|363-en|en|wav/p363_422.wav|||Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.|
042561|363-en|en|wav/p363_423.wav|||He said he had no reports of casualties.|
042562|364-en|en|wav/p364_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
042563|364-en|en|wav/p364_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042564|364-en|en|wav/p364_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042565|364-en|en|wav/p364_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042566|364-en|en|wav/p364_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042567|364-en|en|wav/p364_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042568|364-en|en|wav/p364_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042569|364-en|en|wav/p364_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042570|364-en|en|wav/p364_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042571|364-en|en|wav/p364_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042572|364-en|en|wav/p364_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042573|364-en|en|wav/p364_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042574|364-en|en|wav/p364_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042575|364-en|en|wav/p364_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042576|364-en|en|wav/p364_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042577|364-en|en|wav/p364_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042578|364-en|en|wav/p364_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042579|364-en|en|wav/p364_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042580|364-en|en|wav/p364_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
042581|364-en|en|wav/p364_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042582|364-en|en|wav/p364_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042583|364-en|en|wav/p364_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042585|364-en|en|wav/p364_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042586|364-en|en|wav/p364_025.wav|||Is that not pathetic?|
042587|364-en|en|wav/p364_026.wav|||Our nation has been changed by this event.|
042588|364-en|en|wav/p364_027.wav|||That would be a big step forward.|
042589|364-en|en|wav/p364_028.wav|||I love you so very much.|
042590|364-en|en|wav/p364_029.wav|||Scotland needs to hear it, too.|
042591|364-en|en|wav/p364_030.wav|||Prime minister Blair is not that way.|
042592|364-en|en|wav/p364_031.wav|||But at the moment there isn't the budget.|
042593|364-en|en|wav/p364_032.wav|||It is not a matter of concern.|
042594|364-en|en|wav/p364_033.wav|||We're not either of those things.|
042595|364-en|en|wav/p364_034.wav|||The man has already had too many chances.|
042596|364-en|en|wav/p364_035.wav|||It shouldn't be a problem.|
042597|364-en|en|wav/p364_036.wav|||It was very moving, actually.|
042598|364-en|en|wav/p364_037.wav|||It isn't a free-for-all.|
042599|364-en|en|wav/p364_038.wav|||PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.|
042600|364-en|en|wav/p364_039.wav|||I was not fit enough and it showed.|
042601|364-en|en|wav/p364_040.wav|||I thought it was the only way out.|
042602|364-en|en|wav/p364_041.wav|||We welcome the ministers decision.|
042603|364-en|en|wav/p364_042.wav|||Since then it has become a tradition.|
042604|364-en|en|wav/p364_043.wav|||The concept is simple.|
042605|364-en|en|wav/p364_044.wav|||That is how the Farmer is feeling today.|
042606|364-en|en|wav/p364_045.wav|||And that's the trouble with this business.|
042607|364-en|en|wav/p364_046.wav|||So what did he do?|
042608|364-en|en|wav/p364_047.wav|||We must not give in to bastards.|
042609|364-en|en|wav/p364_048.wav|||The trial will open today.|
042610|364-en|en|wav/p364_049.wav|||But it didn't happen.|
042611|364-en|en|wav/p364_050.wav|||What do you think they said?|
042612|364-en|en|wav/p364_051.wav|||There will be no disruption in the schools.|
042613|364-en|en|wav/p364_053.wav|||I can live with that.|
042614|364-en|en|wav/p364_054.wav|||There is no doubt about that.|
042615|364-en|en|wav/p364_055.wav|||The president took offence.|
042616|364-en|en|wav/p364_056.wav|||Our commitment is to move forward.|
042617|364-en|en|wav/p364_057.wav|||Partly, it is his own fault.|
042618|364-en|en|wav/p364_058.wav|||That's where it all started.|
042619|364-en|en|wav/p364_059.wav|||The family is so happy for him.|
042620|364-en|en|wav/p364_060.wav|||Why has it taken so long?|
042621|364-en|en|wav/p364_061.wav|||No-one knows the numbers.|
042622|364-en|en|wav/p364_062.wav|||You make the choice.|
042623|364-en|en|wav/p364_063.wav|||It is not the fault of one man, of course.|
042624|364-en|en|wav/p364_064.wav|||I knew the script.|
042625|364-en|en|wav/p364_065.wav|||It's not going to work.|
042626|364-en|en|wav/p364_066.wav|||He leaves a beat.|
042627|364-en|en|wav/p364_067.wav|||Perhaps it was her demeanour.|
042628|364-en|en|wav/p364_068.wav|||I see no need to change.|
042629|364-en|en|wav/p364_069.wav|||It lasted longer than we thought.|
042630|364-en|en|wav/p364_070.wav|||They've got more time.|
042631|364-en|en|wav/p364_071.wav|||They made a huge impression on me.|
042632|364-en|en|wav/p364_072.wav|||There is no hiding place.|
042633|364-en|en|wav/p364_073.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
042634|364-en|en|wav/p364_074.wav|||This was a massive result for us.|
042635|364-en|en|wav/p364_075.wav|||It's not in my nature.|
042636|364-en|en|wav/p364_076.wav|||You see - this business is a good one.|
042637|364-en|en|wav/p364_077.wav|||Who is he?|
042638|364-en|en|wav/p364_078.wav|||Scotland were on Saturday.|
042639|364-en|en|wav/p364_079.wav|||He wanted to talk to me about it.|
042640|364-en|en|wav/p364_081.wav|||That would be a big mistake.|
042641|364-en|en|wav/p364_082.wav|||No-one has spoken to me.|
042642|364-en|en|wav/p364_083.wav|||His arrival could be the making of them.|
042643|364-en|en|wav/p364_084.wav|||I was close enough.|
042644|364-en|en|wav/p364_085.wav|||He dismissed the action.|
042645|364-en|en|wav/p364_086.wav|||I said How much?|
042646|364-en|en|wav/p364_087.wav|||I support the stand that they are making.|
042647|364-en|en|wav/p364_088.wav|||The couple had one daughter.|
042648|364-en|en|wav/p364_089.wav|||But was it really so big?|
042649|364-en|en|wav/p364_090.wav|||Nature will not find its own level.|
042650|364-en|en|wav/p364_091.wav|||I didn't have the choice.|
042651|364-en|en|wav/p364_092.wav|||But this has already been rejected.|
042652|364-en|en|wav/p364_094.wav|||They have not seen her for years.|
042653|364-en|en|wav/p364_095.wav|||It was good to score the goal today.|
042654|364-en|en|wav/p364_096.wav|||Allison is not convinced.|
042655|364-en|en|wav/p364_097.wav|||He felt there was no case to answer.|
042656|364-en|en|wav/p364_098.wav|||This is a one-off.|
042657|364-en|en|wav/p364_099.wav|||He liked to talk.|
042658|364-en|en|wav/p364_100.wav|||Lots of others were doing the same.|
042659|364-en|en|wav/p364_101.wav|||It is still holding good today.|
042660|364-en|en|wav/p364_102.wav|||This takes the pressure off.|
042661|364-en|en|wav/p364_103.wav|||Our legal advice is clear.|
042662|364-en|en|wav/p364_104.wav|||But he has a lifeline.|
042663|364-en|en|wav/p364_105.wav|||This is a horrible loss.|
042664|364-en|en|wav/p364_106.wav|||Long-term, it was the right thing to do.|
042665|364-en|en|wav/p364_107.wav|||We are not leaving the area.|
042666|364-en|en|wav/p364_108.wav|||The airspace above the theatre was closed off.|
042667|364-en|en|wav/p364_109.wav|||Success in Scotland is important.|
042668|364-en|en|wav/p364_110.wav|||We could do a lot worse.|
042669|364-en|en|wav/p364_111.wav|||I know the worry over Iraq.|
042670|364-en|en|wav/p364_112.wav|||The outcome is now in our own hands.|
042671|364-en|en|wav/p364_113.wav|||It was just great.|
042672|364-en|en|wav/p364_114.wav|||You are always aware of the injury potential.|
042673|364-en|en|wav/p364_115.wav|||We don't know what is happening to them.|
042674|364-en|en|wav/p364_116.wav|||It's an old story.|
042675|364-en|en|wav/p364_117.wav|||It was an important part of the course.|
042676|364-en|en|wav/p364_118.wav|||It has been a great success.|
042677|364-en|en|wav/p364_119.wav|||I will be trying to do better tomorrow.|
042678|364-en|en|wav/p364_120.wav|||Who will take them after that?|
042679|364-en|en|wav/p364_121.wav|||It is part of their job.|
042680|364-en|en|wav/p364_122.wav|||This decision is a victory for common sense.|
042681|364-en|en|wav/p364_123.wav|||One is too many.|
042682|364-en|en|wav/p364_124.wav|||What can you say?|
042683|364-en|en|wav/p364_125.wav|||This means that our programme is quite unusual.|
042684|364-en|en|wav/p364_126.wav|||The money all appears to be gone.|
042685|364-en|en|wav/p364_127.wav|||He was extremely ill.|
042686|364-en|en|wav/p364_128.wav|||This time, it was not be.|
042687|364-en|en|wav/p364_129.wav|||They are unable to say anything.|
042688|364-en|en|wav/p364_130.wav|||The timing is wrong.|
042689|364-en|en|wav/p364_131.wav|||That's why he is a national treasure.|
042690|364-en|en|wav/p364_132.wav|||He just attracted people.|
042691|364-en|en|wav/p364_133.wav|||He will be fine.|
042692|364-en|en|wav/p364_134.wav|||I love a clever reader.|
042693|364-en|en|wav/p364_135.wav|||There will be no exceptions to this rule.|
042694|364-en|en|wav/p364_136.wav|||But he's a very quiet man.|
042695|364-en|en|wav/p364_137.wav|||Destruction came from within.|
042696|364-en|en|wav/p364_138.wav|||It's not their fault.|
042697|364-en|en|wav/p364_140.wav|||It won the match.|
042698|364-en|en|wav/p364_141.wav|||New investment will be openly tendered.|
042699|364-en|en|wav/p364_142.wav|||I'd never have called a doctor for myself.|

042701|364-en|en|wav/p364_144.wav|||I don't entirely buy that.|
042702|364-en|en|wav/p364_145.wav|||It was the rugby writers dinner in London.|
042703|364-en|en|wav/p364_146.wav|||The casting of her husband was an accident.|
042704|364-en|en|wav/p364_147.wav|||I would say so.|
042705|364-en|en|wav/p364_148.wav|||I've had six days of rehearsal.|
042706|364-en|en|wav/p364_149.wav|||It's a good story.|
042707|364-en|en|wav/p364_150.wav|||Do not listen to them.|
042708|364-en|en|wav/p364_151.wav|||It was too soon.|
042709|364-en|en|wav/p364_152.wav|||It is an absolute disgrace.|
042710|364-en|en|wav/p364_153.wav|||I don't think it is the case.|
042711|364-en|en|wav/p364_154.wav|||Everyone would have been happy.|
042712|364-en|en|wav/p364_155.wav|||It has paid off.|
042713|364-en|en|wav/p364_156.wav|||Ferguson had done his homework.|
042714|364-en|en|wav/p364_157.wav|||He deserved that much.|

042733|364-en|en|wav/p364_176.wav|||I learned that only yesterday.|
042734|364-en|en|wav/p364_177.wav|||It's very very frustrating.|
042735|364-en|en|wav/p364_178.wav|||We want him to continue that way.|
042736|364-en|en|wav/p364_179.wav|||But he did not rule out further talks.|
042737|364-en|en|wav/p364_180.wav|||Our children are our future.|
042738|364-en|en|wav/p364_181.wav|||It's part of your life.|
042739|364-en|en|wav/p364_182.wav|||We will see how he is.|
042740|364-en|en|wav/p364_183.wav|||He had a horror.|
042741|364-en|en|wav/p364_184.wav|||So it was in politics.|
042742|364-en|en|wav/p364_185.wav|||There are two offerings from Scotland.|
042743|364-en|en|wav/p364_187.wav|||The matter has been reported to the police.|
042744|364-en|en|wav/p364_188.wav|||We are at war.|
042745|364-en|en|wav/p364_189.wav|||We do know the reaction of the SAC.|
042746|364-en|en|wav/p364_190.wav|||The state is controlled by the left.|
042747|364-en|en|wav/p364_191.wav|||The principle is quite clear.|
042748|364-en|en|wav/p364_192.wav|||Despite that, it was a great day for me.|
042749|364-en|en|wav/p364_193.wav|||I would say the risk is very small.|
042750|364-en|en|wav/p364_194.wav|||And there are different perspectives.|
042751|364-en|en|wav/p364_195.wav|||Mr Wallace was unimpressed.|
042752|364-en|en|wav/p364_196.wav|||I put the drawing down.|
042753|364-en|en|wav/p364_197.wav|||The hearing continues today.|
042754|364-en|en|wav/p364_198.wav|||You would be wrong.|
042755|364-en|en|wav/p364_199.wav|||On recent evidence, he will not be missed.|
042756|364-en|en|wav/p364_200.wav|||Police have refused to name the couple involved.|
042757|364-en|en|wav/p364_201.wav|||Our destiny is in our own hands.|
042758|364-en|en|wav/p364_202.wav|||The attitude was good today.|
042759|364-en|en|wav/p364_203.wav|||I've got nothing to say.|
042760|364-en|en|wav/p364_204.wav|||It requires a wider team.|
042761|364-en|en|wav/p364_205.wav|||It is so beautiful.|
042762|364-en|en|wav/p364_206.wav|||It is suitable and sensible.|
042763|364-en|en|wav/p364_207.wav|||In many ways it was disastrous.|
042764|364-en|en|wav/p364_208.wav|||I am really, really happy.|
042765|364-en|en|wav/p364_209.wav|||This is perfectly legal.|
042766|364-en|en|wav/p364_210.wav|||I'm not interested in money.|
042767|364-en|en|wav/p364_211.wav|||I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.|
042768|364-en|en|wav/p364_212.wav|||I can handle the pace.|
042769|364-en|en|wav/p364_213.wav|||I am happy to be here.|
042770|364-en|en|wav/p364_214.wav|||We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.|
042771|364-en|en|wav/p364_215.wav|||I believe it would have been successful.|
042772|364-en|en|wav/p364_216.wav|||It's better to be happy.|
042773|364-en|en|wav/p364_217.wav|||It's happened, but it's a dream.|
042774|364-en|en|wav/p364_218.wav|||I had a son.|
042775|364-en|en|wav/p364_219.wav|||It was very, very frightening.|
042776|364-en|en|wav/p364_220.wav|||That suggests that out fitness is good.|
042777|364-en|en|wav/p364_221.wav|||I had no choice.|
042778|364-en|en|wav/p364_222.wav|||What do you do.|
042779|364-en|en|wav/p364_223.wav|||It would also delay the Scottish results.|
042780|364-en|en|wav/p364_224.wav|||This one would have been.|
042781|364-en|en|wav/p364_225.wav|||We just have to improve.|
042782|364-en|en|wav/p364_226.wav|||It hasn't worked out that way.|
042783|364-en|en|wav/p364_227.wav|||This is very good news.|
042784|364-en|en|wav/p364_228.wav|||Is it a warning to parents?|
042785|364-en|en|wav/p364_229.wav|||Everything is surrounded by confusion.|
042786|364-en|en|wav/p364_230.wav|||There is nothing wrong with that.|
042787|364-en|en|wav/p364_231.wav|||I could not believe the results.|
042788|364-en|en|wav/p364_232.wav|||What do you do?|
042789|364-en|en|wav/p364_233.wav|||And there are some interesting conductors, too.|
042790|364-en|en|wav/p364_234.wav|||It was all over for us then.|
042791|364-en|en|wav/p364_235.wav|||They were assured that it would.|
042792|364-en|en|wav/p364_236.wav|||Thankfully they liked it.|
042793|364-en|en|wav/p364_237.wav|||I am very encouraged by this poll.|
042794|364-en|en|wav/p364_238.wav|||We just do not do it.|
042795|364-en|en|wav/p364_239.wav|||It was a long time coming.|
042796|364-en|en|wav/p364_240.wav|||It had happened to him.|
042797|364-en|en|wav/p364_241.wav|||That is our business.|
042798|364-en|en|wav/p364_242.wav|||We were completely outplayed.|
042799|364-en|en|wav/p364_243.wav|||The car driver was not injured.|
042800|364-en|en|wav/p364_244.wav|||It was a surprising decision.|
042801|364-en|en|wav/p364_245.wav|||Colin Cameron was excellent.|
042802|364-en|en|wav/p364_246.wav|||I believe in having difficult times.|
042803|364-en|en|wav/p364_247.wav|||Stand by for action.|
042804|364-en|en|wav/p364_248.wav|||It was something special.|
042805|364-en|en|wav/p364_249.wav|||He deserves a top team.|
042806|364-en|en|wav/p364_250.wav|||We just need the Government to act.|
042807|364-en|en|wav/p364_251.wav|||It was really surprising.|
042808|364-en|en|wav/p364_252.wav|||It was a nightmare.|
042809|364-en|en|wav/p364_253.wav|||But this is just the first step.|
042810|364-en|en|wav/p364_254.wav|||We can do it.|
042811|364-en|en|wav/p364_255.wav|||This is as bad as it gets.|
042812|364-en|en|wav/p364_256.wav|||The real issue is personal.|
042813|364-en|en|wav/p364_257.wav|||That can happen so easily.|
042814|364-en|en|wav/p364_258.wav|||We deserved to get the victory today.|
042815|364-en|en|wav/p364_259.wav|||That's the last thing he will do.|
042816|364-en|en|wav/p364_260.wav|||FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.|
042817|364-en|en|wav/p364_261.wav|||It does not take much.|
042818|364-en|en|wav/p364_262.wav|||It would be a bonus for this game.|
042819|364-en|en|wav/p364_263.wav|||I've seen it work already.|
042820|364-en|en|wav/p364_264.wav|||Do you mean today?|
042821|364-en|en|wav/p364_265.wav|||Israeli forces denied the claim.|
042822|364-en|en|wav/p364_266.wav|||This could be the case.|
042823|364-en|en|wav/p364_267.wav|||We try to keep it right.|
042824|364-en|en|wav/p364_268.wav|||I have got to keep the lid on.|
042825|364-en|en|wav/p364_269.wav|||Or so we thought.|
042826|364-en|en|wav/p364_270.wav|||For many, it had become a fact of life.|
042827|364-en|en|wav/p364_271.wav|||Last season was very hard for me.|
042828|364-en|en|wav/p364_272.wav|||It was a definite penalty.|
042829|364-en|en|wav/p364_273.wav|||It's great fun to get to act.|
042830|364-en|en|wav/p364_274.wav|||We are keen to have him back.|
042831|364-en|en|wav/p364_275.wav|||Horses have some sense.|
042832|364-en|en|wav/p364_276.wav|||It goes in cycles.|
042833|364-en|en|wav/p364_277.wav|||And now he has decided, enough.|
042834|364-en|en|wav/p364_278.wav|||Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.|
042835|364-en|en|wav/p364_279.wav|||He made no comment.|
042836|364-en|en|wav/p364_280.wav|||We have to get on with it.|
042837|364-en|en|wav/p364_281.wav|||He was at the game, and he is indeed.|
042838|364-en|en|wav/p364_282.wav|||It would be dangerous to resign.|
042839|364-en|en|wav/p364_283.wav|||It is a victory to that extent.|
042840|364-en|en|wav/p364_284.wav|||Clearly, the future remains uncertain.|
042841|364-en|en|wav/p364_285.wav|||I certainly hope so.|
042842|364-en|en|wav/p364_286.wav|||She died later on Monday.|
042843|364-en|en|wav/p364_287.wav|||It does and it doesn't.|
042844|364-en|en|wav/p364_288.wav|||It will not be today, though.|
042845|364-en|en|wav/p364_289.wav|||We suspect he was pleased.|
042846|364-en|en|wav/p364_290.wav|||I have been here for only three months.|
042847|364-en|en|wav/p364_291.wav|||We have no knowledge of this.|
042848|364-en|en|wav/p364_292.wav|||I was the willing journeyman.|
042849|364-en|en|wav/p364_293.wav|||I know we ask a lot of you.|
042850|364-en|en|wav/p364_294.wav|||When he got up he was hit again.|
042851|364-en|en|wav/p364_297.wav|||It was just one man.|
042852|364-en|en|wav/p364_298.wav|||It's going to be tough.|
042853|364-en|en|wav/p364_299.wav|||You will be very, very welcome.|
042854|364-en|en|wav/p364_300.wav|||I really want to win in Glasgow.|
042855|364-en|en|wav/p364_301.wav|||Is he any good?|
042856|364-en|en|wav/p364_302.wav|||The proposals have been taken out of context.|
042857|364-en|en|wav/p364_303.wav|||It was then that Rangers scored.|
042858|364-en|en|wav/p364_304.wav|||This was repeated the second time.|
042859|364-en|en|wav/p364_305.wav|||I chose the former.|
042860|364-en|en|wav/p364_306.wav|||Sub Not Used, McKee.|
042861|364-en|en|wav/p364_308.wav|||They were very responsive.|
042862|364-en|en|wav/p364_309.wav|||We're talking to him.|
042863|374-en|en|wav/p374_001.wav|||Please call Stella.|
042864|374-en|en|wav/p374_002.wav|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042865|374-en|en|wav/p374_003.wav|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042866|374-en|en|wav/p374_004.wav|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042867|374-en|en|wav/p374_005.wav|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042868|374-en|en|wav/p374_006.wav|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042869|374-en|en|wav/p374_007.wav|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042870|374-en|en|wav/p374_008.wav|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042871|374-en|en|wav/p374_009.wav|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042872|374-en|en|wav/p374_010.wav|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042873|374-en|en|wav/p374_011.wav|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042874|374-en|en|wav/p374_012.wav|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042875|374-en|en|wav/p374_013.wav|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042876|374-en|en|wav/p374_014.wav|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042877|374-en|en|wav/p374_015.wav|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042878|374-en|en|wav/p374_016.wav|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042879|374-en|en|wav/p374_017.wav|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042880|374-en|en|wav/p374_018.wav|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042881|374-en|en|wav/p374_019.wav|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042882|374-en|en|wav/p374_020.wav|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042883|374-en|en|wav/p374_021.wav|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042884|374-en|en|wav/p374_022.wav|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042886|374-en|en|wav/p374_024.wav|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042887|374-en|en|wav/p374_025.wav|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
042888|374-en|en|wav/p374_026.wav|||This isn't some form of commission.|
042889|374-en|en|wav/p374_027.wav|||The game today is certainly different.|
042890|374-en|en|wav/p374_028.wav|||We did it in one take.|
042891|374-en|en|wav/p374_029.wav|||I'll take the blame for that.|
042892|374-en|en|wav/p374_030.wav|||And that was just for starters.|
042893|374-en|en|wav/p374_031.wav|||In order to get there, we have got to invest.|
042894|374-en|en|wav/p374_032.wav|||Why did it take a concerted campaign?|
042895|374-en|en|wav/p374_033.wav|||I will always remember the horrible images.|
042896|374-en|en|wav/p374_034.wav|||What you sow, you have to reap.|
042897|374-en|en|wav/p374_035.wav|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
042898|374-en|en|wav/p374_036.wav|||I was contacted this morning.|
042899|374-en|en|wav/p374_037.wav|||He didn't want me to leave the house.|
042900|374-en|en|wav/p374_038.wav|||It's not just a challenge for us.|
042901|374-en|en|wav/p374_039.wav|||But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|
042902|374-en|en|wav/p374_040.wav|||I've had a ball.|
042903|374-en|en|wav/p374_041.wav|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|
042904|374-en|en|wav/p374_042.wav|||YOU thought it was a headache.|
042905|374-en|en|wav/p374_043.wav|||I still hope to go.|
042906|374-en|en|wav/p374_044.wav|||Does that put pressure on us?|
042907|374-en|en|wav/p374_045.wav|||As a player you have to move on.|
042908|374-en|en|wav/p374_046.wav|||It is so out of character.|
042909|374-en|en|wav/p374_047.wav|||I am inclined to play it down.|
042910|374-en|en|wav/p374_048.wav|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
042911|374-en|en|wav/p374_049.wav|||His condition was serious but stable.|
042912|374-en|en|wav/p374_050.wav|||He had reason to be pleased.|
042913|374-en|en|wav/p374_051.wav|||We have a problem.|
042914|374-en|en|wav/p374_052.wav|||I find it puzzling and disturbing.|
042915|374-en|en|wav/p374_053.wav|||That alibi is now gone.|
042916|374-en|en|wav/p374_054.wav|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
042917|374-en|en|wav/p374_055.wav|||I suspect the latter.|
042918|374-en|en|wav/p374_056.wav|||However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|
042919|374-en|en|wav/p374_057.wav|||It is simple, really.|
042920|374-en|en|wav/p374_058.wav|||The net is closing.|
042921|374-en|en|wav/p374_059.wav|||I cannot believe she has been admonished.|
042922|374-en|en|wav/p374_060.wav|||That took a long time to happen.|
042923|374-en|en|wav/p374_061.wav|||It was on fire.|
042924|374-en|en|wav/p374_062.wav|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
042925|374-en|en|wav/p374_063.wav|||Nobody did in those days.|
042926|374-en|en|wav/p374_064.wav|||You, the British people, are the boss.|
042927|374-en|en|wav/p374_065.wav|||Where is the discipline?|
042928|374-en|en|wav/p374_066.wav|||We were very much a happy family.|
042929|374-en|en|wav/p374_067.wav|||They won the trophy in the Hoops.|
042930|374-en|en|wav/p374_068.wav|||This time it is official.|
042931|374-en|en|wav/p374_069.wav|||It's going to be epic.|
042932|374-en|en|wav/p374_070.wav|||She could easily have been killed.|
042933|374-en|en|wav/p374_071.wav|||Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|
042934|374-en|en|wav/p374_072.wav|||I didn't mean to kill her.|
042935|374-en|en|wav/p374_073.wav|||We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|
042936|374-en|en|wav/p374_074.wav|||That money could have been coming to Scotland.|
042937|374-en|en|wav/p374_075.wav|||I'd love to do another Olympics.|
042938|374-en|en|wav/p374_076.wav|||What method of funding is being used?|
042939|374-en|en|wav/p374_077.wav|||It is not a standing army.|
042940|374-en|en|wav/p374_078.wav|||This is a great day.|
042941|374-en|en|wav/p374_079.wav|||He got his degree.|
042942|374-en|en|wav/p374_080.wav|||I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|
042943|374-en|en|wav/p374_081.wav|||and their remit is limited.|
042944|374-en|en|wav/p374_082.wav|||I have great respect for all my players.|
042945|374-en|en|wav/p374_083.wav|||They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|
042946|374-en|en|wav/p374_084.wav|||There is no question of dithering.|
042947|374-en|en|wav/p374_085.wav|||His track record is not promising.|
042948|374-en|en|wav/p374_086.wav|||Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|
042949|374-en|en|wav/p374_087.wav|||It would be very dangerous.|
042950|374-en|en|wav/p374_088.wav|||Now it has been eclipsed.|
042951|374-en|en|wav/p374_089.wav|||Our numbers are small.|
042952|374-en|en|wav/p374_090.wav|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
042953|374-en|en|wav/p374_091.wav|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
042954|374-en|en|wav/p374_092.wav|||It's not right of Labour.|
042955|374-en|en|wav/p374_093.wav|||It doesn't always work that way.|
042956|374-en|en|wav/p374_094.wav|||This was much worse.|
042957|374-en|en|wav/p374_095.wav|||That, though, is not true.|
042958|374-en|en|wav/p374_096.wav|||I'm working at the moment.|
042959|374-en|en|wav/p374_097.wav|||However, this is only the start.|
042960|374-en|en|wav/p374_098.wav|||They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.|
042961|374-en|en|wav/p374_099.wav|||He loved it, and so did they.|
042962|374-en|en|wav/p374_100.wav|||I want to be there by right.|
042963|374-en|en|wav/p374_101.wav|||That was very important.|
042964|374-en|en|wav/p374_102.wav|||Two and a half million people have died.|
042965|374-en|en|wav/p374_103.wav|||I hope they understand that.|
042966|374-en|en|wav/p374_104.wav|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
042967|374-en|en|wav/p374_105.wav|||It's a very, very special day.|
042968|374-en|en|wav/p374_106.wav|||Let that be their memorial.|
042969|374-en|en|wav/p374_107.wav|||We're all paying for it.|
042970|374-en|en|wav/p374_108.wav|||Lester was like that.|
042971|374-en|en|wav/p374_109.wav|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
042972|374-en|en|wav/p374_110.wav|||That is very, very bad news for our nation.|
042973|374-en|en|wav/p374_111.wav|||We were never told it was already decided.|
042974|374-en|en|wav/p374_112.wav|||It was a sickening sight.|
042975|374-en|en|wav/p374_113.wav|||We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.|
042976|374-en|en|wav/p374_114.wav|||I don't think it would make any difference.|
042977|374-en|en|wav/p374_115.wav|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
042978|374-en|en|wav/p374_116.wav|||If that is not a warning, what is it?|
042979|374-en|en|wav/p374_117.wav|||I fell in love with it.|
042980|374-en|en|wav/p374_118.wav|||It ignores the future.|
042981|374-en|en|wav/p374_119.wav|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
042982|374-en|en|wav/p374_120.wav|||That's not going to happen again.|
042983|374-en|en|wav/p374_121.wav|||Paterson was the man.|
042984|374-en|en|wav/p374_122.wav|||The course is in great condition.|
042985|374-en|en|wav/p374_123.wav|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
042986|374-en|en|wav/p374_124.wav|||It is too early to speculate.|
042987|374-en|en|wav/p374_125.wav|||It's up to them.|
042988|374-en|en|wav/p374_126.wav|||They went to the press.|
042989|374-en|en|wav/p374_127.wav|||I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|
042990|374-en|en|wav/p374_128.wav|||We are very pleased.|
042991|374-en|en|wav/p374_129.wav|||You're not going to get hurt.|
042992|374-en|en|wav/p374_130.wav|||THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|
042993|374-en|en|wav/p374_131.wav|||I was very fortunate.|
042994|374-en|en|wav/p374_132.wav|||It had been in place since last July.|
042995|374-en|en|wav/p374_133.wav|||Players want to know what is on offer.|
042996|374-en|en|wav/p374_134.wav|||They are a good team.|
042997|374-en|en|wav/p374_135.wav|||The contest was already over.|
042998|374-en|en|wav/p374_136.wav|||Does it make a profit?|
042999|374-en|en|wav/p374_137.wav|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
043000|374-en|en|wav/p374_138.wav|||It was the only possible decision.|
043001|374-en|en|wav/p374_139.wav|||How much of a cop out is that?|
043002|374-en|en|wav/p374_140.wav|||The whole region is in shock.|
043003|374-en|en|wav/p374_141.wav|||Where is the logic in that?|
043004|374-en|en|wav/p374_142.wav|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
043005|374-en|en|wav/p374_143.wav|||I told the players that at half-time.|
043006|374-en|en|wav/p374_144.wav|||I see the extended family once a year.|
043007|374-en|en|wav/p374_145.wav|||Why is this?|
043008|374-en|en|wav/p374_146.wav|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
043009|374-en|en|wav/p374_147.wav|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
043010|374-en|en|wav/p374_148.wav|||There is something in this.|
043011|374-en|en|wav/p374_149.wav|||And so it should.|
043012|374-en|en|wav/p374_150.wav|||News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.|
043013|374-en|en|wav/p374_151.wav|||They may differ on other issues.|
043014|374-en|en|wav/p374_152.wav|||That's the important thing.|
043015|374-en|en|wav/p374_153.wav|||But opinion was divided.|
043016|374-en|en|wav/p374_154.wav|||Next league matches Motherwell.|
043017|374-en|en|wav/p374_155.wav|||I have been there already.|
043018|374-en|en|wav/p374_156.wav|||My wife is totally behind me on this.|
043019|374-en|en|wav/p374_157.wav|||Scott and Emily were so happy.|
043020|374-en|en|wav/p374_158.wav|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
043021|374-en|en|wav/p374_159.wav|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
043022|374-en|en|wav/p374_160.wav|||And sooner than we may think.|
043023|374-en|en|wav/p374_161.wav|||It is a step up.|
043024|374-en|en|wav/p374_162.wav|||You probably have never seen them before.|
043025|374-en|en|wav/p374_163.wav|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
043026|374-en|en|wav/p374_164.wav|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
043027|374-en|en|wav/p374_165.wav|||Something has got to change.|
043028|374-en|en|wav/p374_166.wav|||I made a mistake.|
043029|374-en|en|wav/p374_167.wav|||I'd never given up on myself.|
043030|374-en|en|wav/p374_168.wav|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
043031|374-en|en|wav/p374_169.wav|||That's the kind of production it was.|
043032|374-en|en|wav/p374_170.wav|||Little girls are his victims.|
043033|374-en|en|wav/p374_171.wav|||It is not for me, though.|
043034|374-en|en|wav/p374_172.wav|||Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|
043035|374-en|en|wav/p374_173.wav|||The rest is his own.|
043036|374-en|en|wav/p374_174.wav|||The statement was a lie.|
043037|374-en|en|wav/p374_175.wav|||It is the manager's decision.|
043038|374-en|en|wav/p374_176.wav|||It was a day for records.|
043039|374-en|en|wav/p374_177.wav|||The Government has to grasp the nettle.|
043040|374-en|en|wav/p374_178.wav|||There's no reason for panic.|
043041|374-en|en|wav/p374_179.wav|||We have got away with it.|
043042|374-en|en|wav/p374_180.wav|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
043043|374-en|en|wav/p374_181.wav|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
043044|374-en|en|wav/p374_182.wav|||He had planned to sell it.|
043045|374-en|en|wav/p374_183.wav|||It was just one of those days.|
043046|374-en|en|wav/p374_184.wav|||But it did not last.|
043047|374-en|en|wav/p374_185.wav|||She has been unable to work since.|
043048|374-en|en|wav/p374_186.wav|||No-one has ever seen inside.|
043049|374-en|en|wav/p374_187.wav|||I know nothing about that.|
043050|374-en|en|wav/p374_188.wav|||We have not given up.|
043051|374-en|en|wav/p374_189.wav|||Archer is no newcomer to the stage.|
043052|374-en|en|wav/p374_190.wav|||It's a matter of time.|
043053|374-en|en|wav/p374_191.wav|||The number never came.|
043054|374-en|en|wav/p374_192.wav|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
043055|374-en|en|wav/p374_193.wav|||The winner will be announced by early summer.|
043056|374-en|en|wav/p374_194.wav|||This is the New Edinburgh.|
043057|374-en|en|wav/p374_195.wav|||The stadium was full.|
043058|374-en|en|wav/p374_196.wav|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
043059|374-en|en|wav/p374_197.wav|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
043060|374-en|en|wav/p374_198.wav|||His name is Michael Owen.|
043061|374-en|en|wav/p374_199.wav|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
043062|374-en|en|wav/p374_200.wav|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
043063|374-en|en|wav/p374_201.wav|||This hasn't happened in a vacuum.|
043064|374-en|en|wav/p374_202.wav|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|
043065|374-en|en|wav/p374_203.wav|||Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
043066|374-en|en|wav/p374_204.wav|||It was so unfair.|
043067|374-en|en|wav/p374_205.wav|||Smith has not let him down.|
043068|374-en|en|wav/p374_206.wav|||They have to be dealt with.|
043069|374-en|en|wav/p374_207.wav|||Glasgow is a friendly city.|
043070|374-en|en|wav/p374_208.wav|||No, it's actually in a block of flats.|
043071|374-en|en|wav/p374_209.wav|||They were that poor.|
043072|374-en|en|wav/p374_210.wav|||It was an odd affair, in many respects.|
043073|374-en|en|wav/p374_211.wav|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
043074|374-en|en|wav/p374_212.wav|||We're very close to being a good team.|
043075|374-en|en|wav/p374_213.wav|||All these things have an impact.|
043076|374-en|en|wav/p374_214.wav|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
043077|374-en|en|wav/p374_215.wav|||I'm really proud of my young players.|
043078|374-en|en|wav/p374_216.wav|||There was great support all round the route.|
043079|374-en|en|wav/p374_217.wav|||I had nothing to lose.|
043080|374-en|en|wav/p374_218.wav|||That is just not true.|
043081|374-en|en|wav/p374_219.wav|||History is made at the Masters.|
043082|374-en|en|wav/p374_220.wav|||This is not a European Army.|
043083|374-en|en|wav/p374_221.wav|||Not so, he insisted.|
043084|374-en|en|wav/p374_222.wav|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
043085|374-en|en|wav/p374_223.wav|||I wonder what they listen to?|
043086|374-en|en|wav/p374_224.wav|||Does a lot of drawing.|
043087|374-en|en|wav/p374_225.wav|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
043088|374-en|en|wav/p374_226.wav|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
043089|374-en|en|wav/p374_227.wav|||He is doing just that.|
043090|374-en|en|wav/p374_228.wav|||The night is young.|
043091|374-en|en|wav/p374_229.wav|||That is bad enough.|
043092|374-en|en|wav/p374_230.wav|||We used to keep our business rates.|
043093|374-en|en|wav/p374_231.wav|||I suspect that it will.|
043094|374-en|en|wav/p374_232.wav|||We need to think.|
043095|374-en|en|wav/p374_233.wav|||We are very happy with the verdict.|
043096|374-en|en|wav/p374_234.wav|||They want it to work.|
043097|374-en|en|wav/p374_235.wav|||For once it wasn't about money.|
043098|374-en|en|wav/p374_236.wav|||It's not the end of the matter, of course.|
043099|374-en|en|wav/p374_237.wav|||That doesn't happen in Europe.|
043100|374-en|en|wav/p374_238.wav|||Jackson may well be right.|
043101|374-en|en|wav/p374_239.wav|||Then it was the turn of the carnival.|
043102|374-en|en|wav/p374_240.wav|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
043103|374-en|en|wav/p374_241.wav|||It's always somebody else's.|
043104|374-en|en|wav/p374_242.wav|||It could now be up to the courts.|
043105|374-en|en|wav/p374_243.wav|||We can make a difference.|
043106|374-en|en|wav/p374_244.wav|||This was not a contest.|
043107|374-en|en|wav/p374_245.wav|||It is just so sad.|
043108|374-en|en|wav/p374_246.wav|||Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|
043109|374-en|en|wav/p374_247.wav|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
043110|374-en|en|wav/p374_248.wav|||It all depends on the Chancellor.|
043111|374-en|en|wav/p374_249.wav|||I get very excited by that.|
043112|374-en|en|wav/p374_250.wav|||The members have clearly spoken.|
043113|374-en|en|wav/p374_251.wav|||It was not pretty.|
043114|374-en|en|wav/p374_252.wav|||It was like a scene from the Holocaust.|
043115|374-en|en|wav/p374_253.wav|||Which means it matters.|
043116|374-en|en|wav/p374_254.wav|||This is certainly not the case.|
043117|374-en|en|wav/p374_255.wav|||There is great potential on this river.|
043118|374-en|en|wav/p374_256.wav|||It's very difficult to find a buyer.|
043119|374-en|en|wav/p374_257.wav|||Our thoughts are with his family.|
043120|374-en|en|wav/p374_258.wav|||It is a technique.|
043121|374-en|en|wav/p374_259.wav|||The court has not decided.|
043122|374-en|en|wav/p374_260.wav|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
043123|374-en|en|wav/p374_261.wav|||I just want to get rid of it.|
043124|374-en|en|wav/p374_262.wav|||I have not come in to take over.|
043125|374-en|en|wav/p374_263.wav|||Is this accurate?|
043126|374-en|en|wav/p374_264.wav|||But what did it matter?|
043127|374-en|en|wav/p374_265.wav|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
043128|374-en|en|wav/p374_266.wav|||I am expecting to win.|
043129|374-en|en|wav/p374_267.wav|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
043130|374-en|en|wav/p374_268.wav|||I was an athlete.|
043131|374-en|en|wav/p374_269.wav|||We don't need to change the law.|
043132|374-en|en|wav/p374_270.wav|||All of us do.|
043133|374-en|en|wav/p374_271.wav|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
043134|374-en|en|wav/p374_272.wav|||That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.|
043135|374-en|en|wav/p374_273.wav|||We can only do that for so long.|
043136|374-en|en|wav/p374_274.wav|||He got very close tonight.|
043137|374-en|en|wav/p374_275.wav|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
043138|374-en|en|wav/p374_276.wav|||It is our other home.|
043139|374-en|en|wav/p374_277.wav|||Where do you start?|
043140|374-en|en|wav/p374_278.wav|||At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|
043141|374-en|en|wav/p374_279.wav|||It was the first time they met.|
043142|374-en|en|wav/p374_280.wav|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
043143|374-en|en|wav/p374_281.wav|||We are delighted with that.|
043144|374-en|en|wav/p374_282.wav|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
043145|374-en|en|wav/p374_283.wav|||And we're not there yet.|
043146|374-en|en|wav/p374_284.wav|||People don't feel safe, including me.|
043147|374-en|en|wav/p374_285.wav|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
043148|374-en|en|wav/p374_286.wav|||They want to shut the Scottish Office.|
043149|374-en|en|wav/p374_287.wav|||It is something that we will put right.|
043150|374-en|en|wav/p374_288.wav|||I had a good life at Rangers.|
043151|374-en|en|wav/p374_289.wav|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
043152|374-en|en|wav/p374_290.wav|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
043153|374-en|en|wav/p374_291.wav|||It opened last month.|
043154|374-en|en|wav/p374_292.wav|||Just a year later he was dead.|
043155|374-en|en|wav/p374_293.wav|||You must be ready to play anyone.|
043156|374-en|en|wav/p374_294.wav|||This is a club on the rise.|
043157|374-en|en|wav/p374_295.wav|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
043158|374-en|en|wav/p374_296.wav|||That was the theory, anyway.|
043159|374-en|en|wav/p374_297.wav|||I don't know them or anything.|
043160|374-en|en|wav/p374_298.wav|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
043161|374-en|en|wav/p374_299.wav|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
043162|374-en|en|wav/p374_300.wav|||Because we do not need it.|
043163|374-en|en|wav/p374_301.wav|||The atmosphere is businesslike.|
043164|374-en|en|wav/p374_302.wav|||They use them for everything.|
043165|374-en|en|wav/p374_303.wav|||I've already got this.|
043166|374-en|en|wav/p374_304.wav|||There's a story, too.|
043167|374-en|en|wav/p374_305.wav|||There have been different reports from different people.|
043168|374-en|en|wav/p374_306.wav|||But it has all been worthwhile.|
043169|374-en|en|wav/p374_307.wav|||But that's another story for another day.|
043170|374-en|en|wav/p374_308.wav|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
043171|374-en|en|wav/p374_309.wav|||This is as bad as it can get.|
043172|374-en|en|wav/p374_310.wav|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
043173|374-en|en|wav/p374_311.wav|||It was just awful.|
043174|374-en|en|wav/p374_312.wav|||There was a hell of a row.|
043175|374-en|en|wav/p374_313.wav|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
043176|374-en|en|wav/p374_314.wav|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
043177|374-en|en|wav/p374_315.wav|||It's never over until it's over.|

043179|374-en|en|wav/p374_317.wav|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
043180|374-en|en|wav/p374_318.wav|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
043181|374-en|en|wav/p374_319.wav|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|
043182|374-en|en|wav/p374_320.wav|||No one was listening.|
043183|374-en|en|wav/p374_321.wav|||It's not one for the purists.|
043184|374-en|en|wav/p374_322.wav|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
043185|374-en|en|wav/p374_323.wav|||It really is good to be back.|
043186|374-en|en|wav/p374_324.wav|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
043187|374-en|en|wav/p374_325.wav|||It will never happen.|
043188|374-en|en|wav/p374_326.wav|||We cannot go on like this.|
043189|374-en|en|wav/p374_327.wav|||The biggest thing is structure.|
043190|374-en|en|wav/p374_328.wav|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
043191|374-en|en|wav/p374_329.wav|||This is great news for us.|
043192|374-en|en|wav/p374_330.wav|||We certainly have to try something.|
043193|374-en|en|wav/p374_331.wav|||SO now we know the secret.|
043194|374-en|en|wav/p374_332.wav|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
043195|374-en|en|wav/p374_333.wav|||What is that?|
043196|374-en|en|wav/p374_334.wav|||We just want them home.|
043197|374-en|en|wav/p374_335.wav|||And we have beaten them before.|
043198|374-en|en|wav/p374_336.wav|||He has two children.|
043199|374-en|en|wav/p374_337.wav|||That is the fact of the matter.|
043200|374-en|en|wav/p374_338.wav|||It was a matter of choice.|
043201|374-en|en|wav/p374_339.wav|||And that's good news for the magpies.|
043202|374-en|en|wav/p374_340.wav|||But we can't have a casino.|
043203|374-en|en|wav/p374_341.wav|||I'm looking forward to that.|
043204|374-en|en|wav/p374_342.wav|||So what is their secret?|
043205|374-en|en|wav/p374_343.wav|||It's a great idea.|
043206|374-en|en|wav/p374_344.wav|||It was not being marketed properly.|
043207|374-en|en|wav/p374_345.wav|||I have been struggling with my form.|
043208|374-en|en|wav/p374_346.wav|||That was about it.|
043209|374-en|en|wav/p374_347.wav|||It is coming on very well.|
043210|374-en|en|wav/p374_348.wav|||We won't go down without a struggle.|
043211|374-en|en|wav/p374_349.wav|||By hard work, is the answer.|
043212|374-en|en|wav/p374_350.wav|||We were unlucky not to score.|
043213|374-en|en|wav/p374_351.wav|||I did not have a bet on myself.|
043214|374-en|en|wav/p374_352.wav|||As if they ever stopped.|
043215|374-en|en|wav/p374_353.wav|||And that brings us to the point.|
043216|374-en|en|wav/p374_354.wav|||Clark is back on top form.|
043217|374-en|en|wav/p374_355.wav|||But happily, the story is true.|
043218|374-en|en|wav/p374_356.wav|||It does seem a mystery.|
043219|374-en|en|wav/p374_357.wav|||Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|
043220|374-en|en|wav/p374_358.wav|||It's for that reason he should resign.|
043221|374-en|en|wav/p374_359.wav|||It's a good start.|
043222|374-en|en|wav/p374_360.wav|||One person had a broken back.|
043223|374-en|en|wav/p374_361.wav|||I hope that is the lucky break.|
043224|374-en|en|wav/p374_362.wav|||It is almost like a family.|
043225|374-en|en|wav/p374_363.wav|||But when we do it is great.|
043226|374-en|en|wav/p374_364.wav|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
043227|374-en|en|wav/p374_365.wav|||My game is coming back.|
043228|374-en|en|wav/p374_366.wav|||It was a game they could have won.|
043229|374-en|en|wav/p374_367.wav|||Then came the collision with Sergio.|
043230|374-en|en|wav/p374_368.wav|||It is a matter for Westminster.|
043231|374-en|en|wav/p374_369.wav|||And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|
043232|374-en|en|wav/p374_370.wav|||I can't believe the buzz.|
043233|374-en|en|wav/p374_371.wav|||Sport is good for you.|
043234|374-en|en|wav/p374_372.wav|||I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.|
043235|374-en|en|wav/p374_373.wav|||This is not a struggle against Islam.|
043236|374-en|en|wav/p374_374.wav|||This is the goal.|
043237|374-en|en|wav/p374_375.wav|||The mood was euphoric.|
043238|374-en|en|wav/p374_376.wav|||I want to get at the truth.|
043239|374-en|en|wav/p374_377.wav|||Everyone here is very sad.|
043240|374-en|en|wav/p374_378.wav|||It was located on the remote control.|
043241|374-en|en|wav/p374_379.wav|||I am not changing my mind.|
043242|374-en|en|wav/p374_380.wav|||Is something which we just don't do.|
043243|374-en|en|wav/p374_381.wav|||He was taken ill in his office.|
043244|374-en|en|wav/p374_382.wav|||It is, though the law is not clear cut.|
043245|374-en|en|wav/p374_383.wav|||It's the only thing.|
043246|374-en|en|wav/p374_384.wav|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
043247|374-en|en|wav/p374_385.wav|||What's the best thing to do?|
043248|374-en|en|wav/p374_386.wav|||For tragedy it is.|
043249|374-en|en|wav/p374_387.wav|||I'm trying to stay open on that.|
043250|374-en|en|wav/p374_388.wav|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
043251|374-en|en|wav/p374_389.wav|||It was good today.|

043257|374-en|en|wav/p374_395.wav|||I just don't know what she was doing.|
043258|374-en|en|wav/p374_396.wav|||However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|
043259|374-en|en|wav/p374_397.wav|||You can't have both.|
043260|374-en|en|wav/p374_398.wav|||That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|
043261|374-en|en|wav/p374_399.wav|||I was influenced by all of these things.|
043262|374-en|en|wav/p374_400.wav|||You do not change overnight.|
043263|374-en|en|wav/p374_401.wav|||Or so it seemed.|
043264|374-en|en|wav/p374_402.wav|||I will have to think about it.|
043265|374-en|en|wav/p374_403.wav|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
043266|374-en|en|wav/p374_404.wav|||Well, you can't have everything.|

043268|374-en|en|wav/p374_406.wav|||We need to chat.|
043269|374-en|en|wav/p374_407.wav|||We are obviously disturbed by this case.|
043270|374-en|en|wav/p374_408.wav|||That was never their agenda.|
043271|374-en|en|wav/p374_409.wav|||I certainly will not settle.|
043272|374-en|en|wav/p374_410.wav|||He said it was the worst possible result.|
043273|374-en|en|wav/p374_411.wav|||It's very tragic and traumatic.|
043274|374-en|en|wav/p374_412.wav|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
043275|374-en|en|wav/p374_413.wav|||I don't make it mystical.|
043276|374-en|en|wav/p374_414.wav|||So what was he really doing?|
043277|374-en|en|wav/p374_415.wav|||Neither could be contacted last night.|
043278|374-en|en|wav/p374_416.wav|||That clearly wasn't what they wanted.|
043279|374-en|en|wav/p374_417.wav|||Some old favourites remain in varying forms.|
043280|374-en|en|wav/p374_418.wav|||And well he might.|
043281|374-en|en|wav/p374_419.wav|||They have not been named.|
043282|374-en|en|wav/p374_420.wav|||It feels like too much.|
043283|374-en|en|wav/p374_421.wav|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
043284|374-en|en|wav/p374_422.wav|||Next year this time  we will be home.|
043285|374-en|en|wav/p374_423.wav|||That time has passed.|
043286|374-en|en|wav/p374_424.wav|||It will be crucial.|

043294|376-en|en|wav/p376_008.wav|||"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "|

043304|376-en|en|wav/p376_018.wav|||"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "|

043307|376-en|en|wav/p376_021.wav|||"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "|
