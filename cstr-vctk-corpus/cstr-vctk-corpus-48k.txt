000005|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
000006|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
000007|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000008|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
000009|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
000010|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
000011|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000012|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000013|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
000014|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
000015|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000016|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
000017|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
000018|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
000019|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000020|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000021|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000022|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
000023|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

000045|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_056.mp3|||Clearly, it can go either way.|
000046|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_057.mp3|||However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|
000047|en-225|en|mp3-48k/p225_058.mp3|||However, the problem is the timing.|

000983|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000984|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
000985|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|

000987|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000988|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000989|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

000992|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000993|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
000994|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
000995|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000996|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000997|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000998|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
000999|en-228|en|mp3-48k/p228_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

001350|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
001351|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|

001353|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
001354|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
001355|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
001356|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

001360|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
001361|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
001362|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
001363|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
001364|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
001365|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
001366|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

001373|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_031.mp3|||So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.|
001374|en-229|en|mp3-48k/p229_032.mp3|||Because we do not need it.|

002993|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
002994|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

002998|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

003003|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

003324|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_356.mp3|||Also, it is the season of goodwill.|
003325|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_357.mp3|||Equity declined to comment.|
003326|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_358.mp3|||You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.|
003327|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_359.mp3|||He could make it.|
003328|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_360.mp3|||The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.|
003329|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_361.mp3|||They have not done so this season so far.|
003330|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_362.mp3|||This big issue is whether it can be enforced.|
003331|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_363.mp3|||Safety was also an issue.|
003332|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_364.mp3|||They received a reply from their own managers.|
003333|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_365.mp3|||But I managed.|
003334|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_366.mp3|||They play together perfectly.|
003335|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_367.mp3|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
003336|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_368.mp3|||Colour was at the core of his life.|
003337|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_369.mp3|||It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.|
003338|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_370.mp3|||Ms McNeill was killed on impact.|
003339|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_371.mp3|||We shall not be moved.|
003340|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_373.mp3|||It was a hit.|
003341|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_374.mp3|||He's a nice guy.|
003342|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_375.mp3|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|
003343|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_376.mp3|||Since then, he has played no active part in the company.|
003344|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_377.mp3|||Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.|
003345|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_378.mp3|||The mood was defiant.|
003346|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_379.mp3|||Yet the data is compelling.|
003347|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_381.mp3|||It's just outrageous.|
003348|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_382.mp3|||The road was closed for several hours.|
003349|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_383.mp3|||It is unusual.|
003350|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_384.mp3|||That will come after the game on Saturday.|
003351|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_385.mp3|||The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.|
003352|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_386.mp3|||That set the tone.|
003353|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_387.mp3|||It was a breathtaking moment.|
003354|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_388.mp3|||I was in jail for five years.|
003355|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_389.mp3|||What happened in the summer ?|
003356|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_390.mp3|||The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.|
003357|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_391.mp3|||Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.|
003358|en-233|en|mp3-48k/p233_392.mp3|||He has not created a Festival resource.|
003359|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
003360|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
003361|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
003362|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
003363|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
003364|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
003365|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
003366|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
003367|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
003368|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
003369|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
003370|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
003371|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
003372|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
003373|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
003374|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
003375|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
003376|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
003377|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
003378|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
003379|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
003380|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
003381|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
003382|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_025.mp3|||We are a service industry.|
003383|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_026.mp3|||But we will have to wait.|
003384|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_027.mp3|||Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.|
003385|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_028.mp3|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
003386|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_029.mp3|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
003387|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_030.mp3|||On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.|
003388|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_031.mp3|||It is on the internet.|
003389|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_032.mp3|||Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.|
003390|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_033.mp3|||This is a central issue.|
003391|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_034.mp3|||It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.|
003392|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_035.mp3|||History is in the making.|
003393|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_036.mp3|||It was sold at a loss.|
003394|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_037.mp3|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
003395|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_038.mp3|||Victory was never in doubt.|
003396|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_039.mp3|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
003397|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_040.mp3|||We are the party of the future.|
003398|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_041.mp3|||I have never been a member of the council.|
003399|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_042.mp3|||He was in his element.|
003400|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_043.mp3|||That means an extra two years.|
003401|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_044.mp3|||At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|
003402|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_045.mp3|||All businesses continue to trade.|
003403|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_046.mp3|||The man became a reporter.|
003404|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_047.mp3|||It depends on the decisions of the member states.|
003405|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_048.mp3|||It is all starting to come together.|
003406|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_049.mp3|||Part of the complex is historic.|
003407|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_050.mp3|||The strategy is not without risk.|
003408|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_051.mp3|||But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|
003409|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_052.mp3|||I was released after six days.|
003410|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_053.mp3|||Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|
003411|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_054.mp3|||We are working on it.|
003412|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_055.mp3|||I've never been one for complaining about the press.|
003413|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_056.mp3|||This trend is likely to strengthen.|
003414|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_057.mp3|||Still, he did not let himself down this week.|
003415|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_058.mp3|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
003416|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_059.mp3|||There was no safety net.|
003417|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_060.mp3|||He looks as if he could be worth the risk.|
003418|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_061.mp3|||You have to be patient.|
003419|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_062.mp3|||That is all in the past.|
003420|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_063.mp3|||That could be a mistake.|
003421|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_064.mp3|||It was an amazing result.|
003422|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_065.mp3|||Indeed, it is only the beginning.|
003423|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_066.mp3|||He has not been dropped.|
003424|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_067.mp3|||Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.|
003425|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_068.mp3|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
003426|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_069.mp3|||The market is appalling for initial public offerings.|
003427|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_070.mp3|||This time, it might be for real.|
003428|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_071.mp3|||She did that for the rest of her life.|
003429|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_072.mp3|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
003430|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_073.mp3|||It starts with the script.|
003431|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_074.mp3|||We were under a bit of pressure.|
003432|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_075.mp3|||The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.|
003433|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_076.mp3|||We can all make a mistake.|
003434|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_077.mp3|||Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.|
003435|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_079.mp3|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
003436|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_080.mp3|||On the night, it was not enough.|
003437|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_081.mp3|||It is not long term, but I need time to recover.|
003438|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_082.mp3|||However, a ruling will not come before next week.|
003439|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_083.mp3|||They were badly prepared for it.|
003440|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_084.mp3|||It is not a story.|
003441|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_085.mp3|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
003442|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_086.mp3|||How are you, sir ?|
003443|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_087.mp3|||So is that it, then ?|
003444|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_088.mp3|||Do I have a favourite ?|
003445|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_089.mp3|||What do we do ?|
003446|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_090.mp3|||Why do it otherwise ?|
003447|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_091.mp3|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
003448|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_092.mp3|||They have a further report to make in March.|
003449|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_093.mp3|||He is in the US.|
003450|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_094.mp3|||The Festival is prepared to help.|
003451|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_095.mp3|||By then, he was walking on water.|
003452|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_096.mp3|||I had a bit in hand.|
003453|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_097.mp3|||We have to have a full statement to Parliament.|
003454|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_098.mp3|||I cannot wait to get started on it.|
003455|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_099.mp3|||That is the fact of the matter.|
003456|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_100.mp3|||It should be a condition of employment.|
003457|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_101.mp3|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
003458|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_102.mp3|||It is much as it has been described.|
003459|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_103.mp3|||Police said the family was helping with the search.|
003460|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_104.mp3|||She was there for the start of the campaign.|
003461|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_105.mp3|||He has become a monster.|
003462|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_106.mp3|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
003463|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_107.mp3|||Everyone had to play the game.|
003464|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_108.mp3|||In London today, it was business as usual.|
003465|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_109.mp3|||It is not affected by the sale.|
003466|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_110.mp3|||We are currently working on the details.|
003467|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_111.mp3|||That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.|
003468|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_112.mp3|||That would be a serious problem.|
003469|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_113.mp3|||Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.|
003470|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_114.mp3|||People have been placed in a state of alarm.|
003471|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_115.mp3|||She is not a victim.|
003472|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_116.mp3|||A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|
003473|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_117.mp3|||And we had a good response.|
003474|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_118.mp3|||When we looked at the company.|
003475|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_119.mp3|||No, the equipment is extra.|
003476|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_120.mp3|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
003477|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_121.mp3|||The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|
003478|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_122.mp3|||That admission is not surprising.|
003479|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_123.mp3|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
003480|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_124.mp3|||According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|
003481|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_125.mp3|||There was a lot of resentment.|
003482|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_126.mp3|||He wanted to record the group.|
003483|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_127.mp3|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
003484|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_128.mp3|||The end result is the same.|
003485|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_129.mp3|||Three days later, he was killed.|
003486|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_130.mp3|||We are committed to the ban.|
003487|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_131.mp3|||However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|
003488|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_132.mp3|||The problem was a social problem.|
003489|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_133.mp3|||He had no money left to run the club.|
003490|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_134.mp3|||It is not so simple.|
003491|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_135.mp3|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
003492|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_136.mp3|||So, did she meet him ?|
003493|en-234|en|mp3-48k/p234_137.mp3|||So what is the campaign about ?|

004554|en-238|en|mp3-48k/p238_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

004557|en-238|en|mp3-48k/p238_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
004558|en-238|en|mp3-48k/p238_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
004559|en-238|en|mp3-48k/p238_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
004560|en-238|en|mp3-48k/p238_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

006647|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
006648|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
006649|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
006650|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_025.mp3|||We are a service industry.|
006651|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_026.mp3|||It may be good for the soul.|
006652|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_027.mp3|||We want to lift the cup for the fans.|
006653|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_028.mp3|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
006654|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_029.mp3|||It is about investing in the future.|
006655|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_030.mp3|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
006656|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_031.mp3|||They were in good humour, too.|
006657|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_032.mp3|||The end result is the same.|
006658|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_033.mp3|||It is on the internet.|
006659|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_034.mp3|||These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|
006660|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_035.mp3|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
006661|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_036.mp3|||This is a central issue.|
006662|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_037.mp3|||History is in the making.|
006663|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_038.mp3|||Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|
006664|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_039.mp3|||She was there for the start of the campaign.|
006665|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_040.mp3|||She was at the top.|
006666|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_041.mp3|||In London today, it was business as usual.|
006667|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_042.mp3|||And they had a case.|
006668|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_043.mp3|||Something has to be put in place.|
006669|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_044.mp3|||If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|
006670|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_045.mp3|||They are going after them.|
006671|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_046.mp3|||It is all about the story.|
006672|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_047.mp3|||The whole thing is the music.|
006673|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_048.mp3|||In fact, they are the future of investment.|
006674|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_049.mp3|||That is still the case.|
006675|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_050.mp3|||At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|
006676|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_051.mp3|||In my view, it has to be done.|
006677|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_052.mp3|||The pressure on the players will build.|
006678|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_053.mp3|||Their campaign is in disarray.|
006679|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_054.mp3|||But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|
006680|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_055.mp3|||Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|
006681|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_056.mp3|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|
006682|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_057.mp3|||Clearly, they had other problems.|
006683|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_058.mp3|||This trend is likely to strengthen.|
006684|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_059.mp3|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
006685|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_060.mp3|||We have got to deliver.|
006686|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_061.mp3|||That was the difference today.|
006687|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_062.mp3|||The company continues to grow.|
006688|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_063.mp3|||He said it was for sale.|
006689|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_064.mp3|||We felt it was sufficient.|
006690|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_065.mp3|||That is all in the past.|
006691|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_066.mp3|||There is a lot to be done.|
006692|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_067.mp3|||But that's another story for another day.|
006693|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_068.mp3|||He has not been dropped.|
006694|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_069.mp3|||It was an outstanding performance.|
006695|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_070.mp3|||I can't remember a lot about the accident.|
006696|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_071.mp3|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
006697|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_072.mp3|||It is only the beginning.|
006698|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_073.mp3|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
006699|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_074.mp3|||Only water is currently allowed.|
006700|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_075.mp3|||This time, it might be for real.|
006701|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_076.mp3|||She did that for the rest of her life.|
006702|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_077.mp3|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
006703|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_078.mp3|||That will be the office.|
006704|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_079.mp3|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
006705|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_080.mp3|||How are you, sir ?|
006706|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_081.mp3|||So is that it, then ?|
006707|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_082.mp3|||Do I have a favourite ?|
006708|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_083.mp3|||What do we do ?|
006709|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_084.mp3|||Why do it otherwise ?|
006710|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_085.mp3|||It starts with the script.|
006711|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_086.mp3|||Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|
006712|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_087.mp3|||It would have been around the turn of the century.|
006713|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_088.mp3|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
006714|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_089.mp3|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
006715|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_090.mp3|||It seems a good thing to try.|
006716|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_091.mp3|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
006717|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_092.mp3|||It sounds a lot of money.|
006718|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_093.mp3|||However, a ruling will not come before next week.|
006719|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_094.mp3|||It is not a story.|
006720|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_095.mp3|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
006721|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_096.mp3|||He is in the US.|
006722|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_097.mp3|||I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|
006723|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_098.mp3|||It took an option on the process.|
006724|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_099.mp3|||By then, he was walking on water.|
006725|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_100.mp3|||This is a game of confidence.|
006726|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_101.mp3|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
006727|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_102.mp3|||He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|
006728|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_103.mp3|||The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.|
006729|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_104.mp3|||The trick is to try it.|
006730|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_105.mp3|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
006731|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_106.mp3|||Victory was never in doubt.|
006732|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_107.mp3|||This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|
006733|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_108.mp3|||On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.|
006734|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_109.mp3|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
006735|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_110.mp3|||Then again, we could have.|
006736|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_111.mp3|||There, you were just a body.|
006737|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_112.mp3|||But he has not become a monster.|
006738|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_113.mp3|||He is not a dancer.|
006739|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_114.mp3|||We had planned to sell the property for some time.|
006740|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_115.mp3|||A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|
006741|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_116.mp3|||In the end we have to take a stand.|
006742|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_117.mp3|||This is a sea change in approach.|
006743|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_118.mp3|||Otherwise, the market may come back.|
006744|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_119.mp3|||The procedures were not in place.|
006745|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_120.mp3|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
006746|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_121.mp3|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
006747|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_122.mp3|||He was not alone at the top of the board.|
006748|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_123.mp3|||The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|
006749|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_124.mp3|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
006750|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_125.mp3|||We had a great time.|
006751|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_126.mp3|||I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.|
006752|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_127.mp3|||According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|
006753|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_128.mp3|||It was far from business as usual.|
006754|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_129.mp3|||He wanted to record the group.|
006755|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_130.mp3|||He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|
006756|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_131.mp3|||Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|
006757|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_132.mp3|||It is hard to believe.|
006758|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_133.mp3|||Or it would have been.|
006759|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_134.mp3|||Three days later, he was killed.|
006760|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_135.mp3|||Football is a passion for many.|
006761|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_136.mp3|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
006762|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_137.mp3|||So, did she meet him ?|
006763|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_138.mp3|||So what is the campaign about ?|
006764|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_139.mp3|||And does it ?|
006765|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_140.mp3|||Are you from the rugby ?|
006766|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_141.mp3|||However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|
006767|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_142.mp3|||That was the first step.|
006768|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_143.mp3|||However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|
006769|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_144.mp3|||I have been in contact with him.|
006770|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_145.mp3|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
006771|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_146.mp3|||When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|
006772|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_147.mp3|||They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|
006773|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_148.mp3|||I am the manager of Scotland.|
006774|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_149.mp3|||There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|
006775|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_150.mp3|||There were no grounds for his action.|
006776|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_151.mp3|||I can't even get into the A team.|
006777|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_152.mp3|||It starts at the top.|
006778|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_153.mp3|||Others are expected to follow the lead.|
006779|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_154.mp3|||She does not want to speak.|
006780|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_155.mp3|||It was all for good reason as well.|
006781|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_156.mp3|||One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|
006782|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_157.mp3|||It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|
006783|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_158.mp3|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
006784|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_159.mp3|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
006785|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_160.mp3|||We want to get there.|
006786|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_161.mp3|||On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|
006787|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_162.mp3|||There is a lack of staff.|
006788|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_163.mp3|||Not that the occasion was without restraint.|
006789|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_164.mp3|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|
006790|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_165.mp3|||This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|
006791|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_166.mp3|||At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.|
006792|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_167.mp3|||Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|
006793|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_168.mp3|||Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|
006794|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_169.mp3|||Anyone can do the sums.|
006795|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_170.mp3|||We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.|
006796|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_171.mp3|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
006797|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_172.mp3|||Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|
006798|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_173.mp3|||We were all over the place in the first half.|
006799|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_174.mp3|||Like the others, he was arrested.|
006800|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_175.mp3|||All the pressure was on him.|
006801|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_176.mp3|||Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|
006802|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_177.mp3|||They have not been named.|
006803|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_178.mp3|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
006804|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_179.mp3|||I think the Labour party is completely split on this.|
006805|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_180.mp3|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
006806|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_181.mp3|||I was always in control.|
006807|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_182.mp3|||It was by the numbers.|
006808|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_183.mp3|||I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.|
006809|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_184.mp3|||It should never have happened.|
006810|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_185.mp3|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
006811|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_186.mp3|||The feeling is hard to describe.|
006812|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_187.mp3|||It is difficult to say.|
006813|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_188.mp3|||That is a question for the next manager.|
006814|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_189.mp3|||By then, however, both men were already in the US.|
006815|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_190.mp3|||However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|
006816|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_191.mp3|||It is simply not true.|
006817|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_192.mp3|||Are you going to win ?|
006818|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_193.mp3|||Was it the wife ?|
006819|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_194.mp3|||Why change it ?|
006820|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_195.mp3|||What do we want to do that for ?|
006821|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_196.mp3|||Does the name matter ?|
006822|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_197.mp3|||That you can do it.|
006823|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_198.mp3|||I would like to continue to develop.|
006824|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_199.mp3|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
006825|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_200.mp3|||He has defended the system.|
006826|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_201.mp3|||We want to begin a programme in the UK.|
006827|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_203.mp3|||At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|
006828|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_204.mp3|||It is not an issue.|
006829|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_205.mp3|||They have to get that sorted.|
006830|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_206.mp3|||We can take the city.|
006831|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_207.mp3|||He played it like a veteran.|
006832|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_208.mp3|||It was the story of the second half.|
006833|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_209.mp3|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
006834|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_210.mp3|||As many as the market will support.|
006835|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_211.mp3|||He is believed to live in Britain.|
006836|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_212.mp3|||Hopefully, it will bring new customers.|
006837|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_213.mp3|||The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.|
006838|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_214.mp3|||This conference was never confirmed.|
006839|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_215.mp3|||A team is a team.|
006840|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_216.mp3|||However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|
006841|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_217.mp3|||I'm interested in interesting work.|
006842|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_218.mp3|||It decided to blame the media.|
006843|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_219.mp3|||THE force is with them.|
006844|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_220.mp3|||This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|
006845|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_221.mp3|||It was important to win today.|
006846|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_222.mp3|||He was not injured in the attack.|
006847|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_223.mp3|||Because he was born in England.|
006848|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_224.mp3|||Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|
006849|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_225.mp3|||Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.|
006850|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_226.mp3|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
006851|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_227.mp3|||However, it is not as simple as this.|
006852|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_228.mp3|||We want this place to work.|
006853|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_229.mp3|||It still has an effect.|
006854|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_230.mp3|||The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|
006855|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_231.mp3|||I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|
006856|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_232.mp3|||Other villages were completely deserted.|
006857|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_233.mp3|||There is a lot of concern.|
006858|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_234.mp3|||It will be decided in the next month.|
006859|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_235.mp3|||We have to win the group.|
006860|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_236.mp3|||It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|
006861|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_237.mp3|||We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|
006862|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_238.mp3|||We have an election in eight days.|
006863|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_239.mp3|||There was a lot of resentment.|
006864|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_240.mp3|||This is a fight to the death.|
006865|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_241.mp3|||All will be revealed in due course.|
006866|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_242.mp3|||He is a man of the people.|
006867|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_243.mp3|||The matter is under appeal.|
006868|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_244.mp3|||And they were being paid ?|
006869|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_245.mp3|||was everything done to save people ?|
006870|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_246.mp3|||What was the matter for concern ?|
006871|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_247.mp3|||Do I think about them often ?|
006872|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_248.mp3|||Is it in the right place ?|
006873|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_249.mp3|||Did he trip ?|
006874|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_250.mp3|||Sadly, it could not be done.|
006875|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_251.mp3|||I wouldn't even respond to that question.|
006876|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_252.mp3|||Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|
006877|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_253.mp3|||Instead, he missed the lot.|
006878|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_254.mp3|||I was never in danger.|
006879|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_255.mp3|||A lot has been written.|
006880|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_256.mp3|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
006881|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_257.mp3|||It was really good in the first week.|
006882|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_258.mp3|||If it doesn't, it doesn't.|
006883|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_259.mp3|||However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.|
006884|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_260.mp3|||That is not the case in Europe.|
006885|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_261.mp3|||But it was a loss.|
006886|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_262.mp3|||So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|
006887|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_263.mp3|||The performance continues to improve.|
006888|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_264.mp3|||It expected this trend to continue.|
006889|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_265.mp3|||However, no further action was taken by police.|
006890|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_266.mp3|||It depends on Labour, not on us.|
006891|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_267.mp3|||But we were in control at that point.|
006892|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_268.mp3|||It has to be enforced.|
006893|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_269.mp3|||The party has never fully recovered.|
006894|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_270.mp3|||Moreover, it must be for all sports.|
006895|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_271.mp3|||But the government has so far failed to listen.|
006896|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_272.mp3|||He must have a crack at it.|
006897|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_273.mp3|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
006898|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_274.mp3|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
006899|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_275.mp3|||He was good, but not that good.|
006900|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_276.mp3|||The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|
006901|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_277.mp3|||Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|
006902|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_278.mp3|||However, the matter is not going to end there.|
006903|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_279.mp3|||It might be sad, but it's a fact.|
006904|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_280.mp3|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
006905|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_281.mp3|||Obviously, we would want to look at this.|
006906|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_282.mp3|||On a practical level, it would be difficult.|
006907|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_283.mp3|||If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|
006908|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_284.mp3|||It is important that he is involved.|
006909|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_285.mp3|||If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|
006910|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_286.mp3|||It should be noted that he has been released without charge.|
006911|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_287.mp3|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
006912|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_288.mp3|||Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|
006913|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_290.mp3|||I should think so, too.|
006914|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_291.mp3|||None of the agencies was able to help.|
006915|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_292.mp3|||I didn't see the point.|
006916|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_293.mp3|||This idea has been around for four years.|
006917|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_294.mp3|||We are in a war.|
006918|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_295.mp3|||Do you think we are a top nation ?|
006919|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_296.mp3|||Is our children learning ?|
006920|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_297.mp3|||How independent is that ?|
006921|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_298.mp3|||What form did that take ?|
006922|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_299.mp3|||Are they free ?|
006923|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_300.mp3|||Scotland won by six wickets.|
006924|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_301.mp3|||However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|
006925|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_302.mp3|||This is a historic agreement.|
006926|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_303.mp3|||We have to be realistic.|
006927|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_304.mp3|||Every one is a winner.|
006928|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_305.mp3|||There was a hole in it.|
006929|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_306.mp3|||It will be done in stages.|
006930|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_307.mp3|||It all started with a visiting rugby club.|
006931|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_308.mp3|||Every character was completely different.|
006932|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_309.mp3|||But it is a similar problem.|
006933|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_310.mp3|||In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.|
006934|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_311.mp3|||But it is important for a number of reasons.|
006935|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_312.mp3|||In that moment, I was happy.|
006936|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_313.mp3|||All of the management has invested in the firm.|
006937|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_314.mp3|||It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|
006938|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_315.mp3|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
006939|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_316.mp3|||It involved the same people.|
006940|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_317.mp3|||We want to get back into the Champions League.|
006941|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_318.mp3|||We have to be very, very careful.|
006942|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_319.mp3|||Look at the potential of this club.|
006943|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_320.mp3|||Hopefully, this week will be good.|
006944|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_321.mp3|||This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|
006945|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_322.mp3|||We did something about it.|
006946|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_323.mp3|||But it is up again.|
006947|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_324.mp3|||However, the devil is in the detail.|
006948|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_325.mp3|||For the moment, however, the position is clear.|
006949|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_326.mp3|||The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|
006950|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_327.mp3|||He is already in place.|
006951|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_328.mp3|||Another difference is the cost.|
006952|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_329.mp3|||Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|
006953|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_330.mp3|||And we can do it.|
006954|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_331.mp3|||What are they for ?|
006955|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_333.mp3|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
006956|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_334.mp3|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
006957|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_335.mp3|||And it's a goodbye from him.|
006958|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_336.mp3|||It is a sensitive issue.|
006959|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_337.mp3|||They have to be addressed.|
006960|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_338.mp3|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
006961|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_339.mp3|||Like many companies, it is a problem.|
006962|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_340.mp3|||The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.|
006963|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_341.mp3|||However, a bid was never made.|
006964|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_342.mp3|||That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|
006965|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_343.mp3|||Something is going to have to give.|
006966|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_344.mp3|||And the context is also completely different.|
006967|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_345.mp3|||The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|
006968|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_346.mp3|||The banking sector was weak.|
006969|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_347.mp3|||But the New Year was special.|
006970|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_348.mp3|||We never played at all.|
006971|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_349.mp3|||However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|
006972|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_350.mp3|||This isn't the end of story.|
006973|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_351.mp3|||He is a great prospect.|
006974|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_352.mp3|||He has been told by the doctor to rest.|
006975|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_353.mp3|||However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|
006976|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_354.mp3|||Of course, it does not have to be this way.|
006977|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_355.mp3|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
006978|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_356.mp3|||However, it does not tell the full story.|
006979|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_357.mp3|||They were impressive against France.|
006980|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_358.mp3|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
006981|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_359.mp3|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
006982|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_360.mp3|||It was a test in itself.|
006983|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_361.mp3|||Either team will be hard.|
006984|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_362.mp3|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
006985|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_363.mp3|||At first, the youngster was not keen.|
006986|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_364.mp3|||However, it has to be seen as part of a package.|
006987|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_365.mp3|||On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|
006988|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_366.mp3|||In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|
006989|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_367.mp3|||Lately, that market has come under pressure.|
006990|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_368.mp3|||In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|
006991|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_369.mp3|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
006992|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_370.mp3|||The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|
006993|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_371.mp3|||I have a good feeling about this.|
006994|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_372.mp3|||The news is not all bad.|
006995|en-244|en|mp3-48k/p244_373.mp3|||Some of the passing was a disgrace.|

009438|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
009439|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
009440|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

009442|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
009443|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
009444|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
009445|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
009446|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
009447|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
009448|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
009449|en-251|en|mp3-48k/p251_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

009796|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
009797|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
009798|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
009799|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
009800|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
009801|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
009802|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
009803|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
009804|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

009806|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
009807|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
009808|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
009809|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
009810|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.|
009811|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.|
009812|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
009813|en-252|en|mp3-48k/p252_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

010567|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

010570|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
010571|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
010572|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

010577|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
010578|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
010579|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|

010581|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
010582|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

010592|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_033.mp3|||It's a matter of balance.|
010593|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_034.mp3|||We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.|

010598|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_040.mp3|||It was clear.|
010599|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_041.mp3|||It is not for any other purpose.|
010600|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_042.mp3|||The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.|
010601|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_043.mp3|||I was scared.|
010602|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_044.mp3|||However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.|
010603|en-254|en|mp3-48k/p254_045.mp3|||No meaningful response was issued.|

011343|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

011346|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
011347|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
011348|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
011349|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

011353|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
011354|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
011355|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
011356|en-256|en|mp3-48k/p256_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

012044|en-257|en|mp3-48k/p257_390.mp3|||There was no trouble.|
012045|en-257|en|mp3-48k/p257_391.mp3|||This is a huge confidence boost.|
012046|en-257|en|mp3-48k/p257_392.mp3|||Not because they want to sing about something.|

012095|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
012096|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
012097|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
012098|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
012099|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
012100|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
012101|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
012102|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
012103|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

012105|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
012106|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
012107|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
012108|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
012109|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
012110|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
012111|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
012112|en-258|en|mp3-48k/p258_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

015529|en-266|en|mp3-48k/p266_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
015530|en-266|en|mp3-48k/p266_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
015531|en-266|en|mp3-48k/p266_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
015532|en-266|en|mp3-48k/p266_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

019393|en-275|en|mp3-48k/p275_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
019394|en-275|en|mp3-48k/p275_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|

019396|en-275|en|mp3-48k/p275_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
019397|en-275|en|mp3-48k/p275_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
019398|en-275|en|mp3-48k/p275_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

021535|en-280|en|mp3-48k/p280_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

022772|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

022777|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

022782|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

022784|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|

022786|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
022787|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
022788|en-283|en|mp3-48k/p283_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

023243|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
023244|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
023245|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
023246|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
023247|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
023248|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

023250|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
023251|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
023252|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
023253|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
023254|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
023255|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
023256|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
023257|en-284|en|mp3-48k/p284_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.|

025706|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_354.mp3|||The board of governors must act.|
025707|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_355.mp3|||That didn't happen for two reasons.|
025708|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_356.mp3|||It is time for a new approach.|
025709|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_357.mp3|||Now they have decided to have a rethink.|
025710|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_358.mp3|||Tiger is the exception.|
025711|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_359.mp3|||There's no choice is there?|
025712|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_360.mp3|||Does it, Noel?|
025713|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_361.mp3|||Do not forget about Monaco.|
025714|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_362.mp3|||You can't give in to the vandals.|
025715|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_363.mp3|||Glasgow is far from overload.|
025716|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_364.mp3|||Everything was an effort.|
025717|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_365.mp3|||And does it even matter?|
025718|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_366.mp3|||My parents are exhausted.|
025719|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_367.mp3|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|
025720|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_368.mp3|||That's why he is a national treasure.|
025721|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_369.mp3|||I'm delighted for Andy.|
025722|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_370.mp3|||And how he kept his word.|
025723|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_371.mp3|||It's their duty to protect them.|
025724|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_372.mp3|||The Cup has come home.|
025725|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_373.mp3|||This is a big, big win.|
025726|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_374.mp3|||As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.|
025727|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_375.mp3|||That's an equally important factor.|
025728|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_376.mp3|||We were given a break.|
025729|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_377.mp3|||It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|
025730|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_378.mp3|||That would have killed the match.|
025731|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_379.mp3|||That's not like us at all.|
025732|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_380.mp3|||Scottish teams have got to take their chances.|
025733|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_381.mp3|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|

025742|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_390.mp3|||This was not helpful.|
025743|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_391.mp3|||The police are not the target.|
025744|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_392.mp3|||It's a true story.|
025745|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_393.mp3|||John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.|
025746|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_394.mp3|||But that title is a mistake.|

025774|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_422.mp3|||We didn't get any from his face.|
025775|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_423.mp3|||But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|
025776|en-292|en|mp3-48k/p292_424.mp3|||It's time for a change.|
025777|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
025778|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
025779|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
025780|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
025781|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
025782|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
025783|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
025784|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
025785|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
025786|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
025787|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
025788|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
025789|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
025790|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
025791|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
025792|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
025793|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
025794|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
025795|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
025796|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
025797|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025798|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
025799|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
025800|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_025.mp3|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|
025801|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_026.mp3|||Theatre is not a museum.|
025802|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_027.mp3|||It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.|
025803|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_028.mp3|||All my training is for Athens.|
025804|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_029.mp3|||Subs not used, McCulloch.|
025805|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_030.mp3|||I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.|
025806|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_032.mp3|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
025807|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_033.mp3|||Several others were absent.|
025808|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_034.mp3|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
025809|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_035.mp3|||There is a lot of heroin about.|
025810|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_036.mp3|||There is a growing anger among the group.|
025811|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_037.mp3|||I have got to adopt the same approach.|
025812|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_038.mp3|||Seven people were later detained by police.|
025813|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_039.mp3|||It's a sensible management decision.|
025814|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_040.mp3|||Just watch the videos and you'll see it.|
025815|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_041.mp3|||I would just like someone to confess.|
025816|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_042.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
025817|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_043.mp3|||We can be proud of our achievements.|
025818|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_044.mp3|||Clark is back on top form.|
025819|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_045.mp3|||He denied that he was an absentee landlord.|
025820|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_046.mp3|||Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.|
025821|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_047.mp3|||That was the theory, anyway.|
025822|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_048.mp3|||Ferguson must take the blame.|
025823|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_049.mp3|||This is thought to mean sometime next week.|
025824|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_050.mp3|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
025825|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_051.mp3|||Stealing from the benefits system is no different.|
025826|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_052.mp3|||It is a large number.|
025827|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_053.mp3|||We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|
025828|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_054.mp3|||General, You didn't get a modified.|
025829|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_055.mp3|||It does not even have a staff shortage.|
025830|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_056.mp3|||That is our unfinished business.|
025831|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_057.mp3|||This is far too high.|
025832|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_058.mp3|||The Cabinet is split over the issue.|
025833|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_059.mp3|||In fact, he was talking about the survival business.|
025834|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_060.mp3|||But the foundations have been laid.|
025835|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_061.mp3|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
025836|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_062.mp3|||So they will settle again.|
025837|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_063.mp3|||He had other things on his mind.|
025838|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_064.mp3|||Why did it take a concerted campaign?|
025839|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_065.mp3|||Let us hope so.|
025840|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_066.mp3|||It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.|
025841|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_067.mp3|||A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.|
025842|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_068.mp3|||It felt like my support system was leaving.|
025843|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_069.mp3|||A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.|
025844|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_070.mp3|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
025845|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_071.mp3|||So the challenge is against ourselves.|
025846|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_072.mp3|||You see, my back has gone.|
025847|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_073.mp3|||It has been a lovely family occasion.|
025848|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_074.mp3|||We've had our problems at the club.|
025849|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_075.mp3|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
025850|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_076.mp3|||More than half of the school collapsed.|
025851|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_077.mp3|||We also hope to meet the men.|
025852|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_078.mp3|||I can live with just the one.|
025853|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_079.mp3|||All the people thought that we would die.|
025854|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_080.mp3|||Sometimes they come off.|
025855|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_081.mp3|||A teacher is, really, about unity.|
025856|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_082.mp3|||Our nation has been changed by this event.|
025857|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_083.mp3|||However, my position remains the same.|
025858|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_084.mp3|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
025859|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_085.mp3|||There are plenty examples.|
025860|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_086.mp3|||Self control is just one instalment.|
025861|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_087.mp3|||It's an hour of the same response.|
025862|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_088.mp3|||I could not believe what they were saying.|
025863|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_089.mp3|||A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.|
025864|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_090.mp3|||Will he be given time?|
025865|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_091.mp3|||Beyond that would have been outrageous.|
025866|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_092.mp3|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
025867|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_093.mp3|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
025868|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_094.mp3|||We've been overwhelmed by the response.|
025869|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_095.mp3|||Her presence was almost everywhere.|
025870|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_096.mp3|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
025871|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_097.mp3|||It has been hijacked.|
025872|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_098.mp3|||And he's the first to see that, and say that.|
025873|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_099.mp3|||They must put them back.|
025874|en-293|en|mp3-48k/p293_100.mp3|||You do have a way out.|

026185|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

026190|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

026192|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026193|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
026194|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
026195|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
026196|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

026233|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_061.mp3|||I think we'll just keep it.|
026234|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_062.mp3|||Debate is not just talk.|

026238|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_066.mp3|||What kind of inclusion is that?|
026239|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_067.mp3|||I fell in love with it right away.|

026242|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_070.mp3|||I don't have any answer for them.|
026243|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_071.mp3|||It took about five or six hours.|
026244|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_072.mp3|||I found the course inspiring.|
026245|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_073.mp3|||Two things were clear from the new programme.|
026246|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_074.mp3|||This is the real thing now.|

026254|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_082.mp3|||It was like a vacuum.|
026255|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_083.mp3|||That was enough for the committee.|
026256|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_084.mp3|||It is a very genuine prospect.|
026257|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_085.mp3|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
026258|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_086.mp3|||We have to focus on what is important.|
026259|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_087.mp3|||They have to work so hard.|

026264|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_092.mp3|||Now, though, he has an incentive.|
026265|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_093.mp3|||But now it's back to golf.|
026266|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_094.mp3|||It should be a condition of employment.|
026267|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_095.mp3|||Was it a signal?|
026268|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_096.mp3|||It may not even be possible.|
026269|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_097.mp3|||In fact, they go hand in hand.|
026270|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_098.mp3|||I gave him a way out, and he took it.|
026271|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_099.mp3|||So is that it, then?|
026272|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_100.mp3|||You should have let it write the cards.|
026273|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_101.mp3|||It's annoying in a way.|
026274|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_102.mp3|||It's too close to call.|
026275|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_103.mp3|||It's a long process.|
026276|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_104.mp3|||I asked to take it up to Glasgow.|

026281|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_109.mp3|||That was the context of his remarks.|
026282|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_110.mp3|||This has gone on too long.|

026293|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_121.mp3|||We don't know what happened after.|
026294|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_122.mp3|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
026295|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_123.mp3|||He seems to be used to the attention.|
026296|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_124.mp3|||It's an hour of the same response.|
026297|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_125.mp3|||We have very real concerns about it.|
026298|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_126.mp3|||He has gone through the process before.|

026300|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_128.mp3|||I can't speak for him.|
026301|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_129.mp3|||They were married in Edinburgh last summer.|
026302|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_130.mp3|||The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.|
026303|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_131.mp3|||I can't see him reversing that.|
026304|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_132.mp3|||I'm deeply sorry they did.|
026305|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_133.mp3|||I can lead by example.|

026311|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_139.mp3|||The objective was achieved.|
026312|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_140.mp3|||It was a hugely popular decision.|
026313|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_141.mp3|||He invented the language.|
026314|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_142.mp3|||Where are they?|
026315|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_143.mp3|||It's hard not to.|
026316|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_144.mp3|||It is a question of life and death.|

026320|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_148.mp3|||We are all very proud of her.|
026321|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_149.mp3|||I'm sure that is not.|
026322|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_150.mp3|||It's a great idea.|
026323|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_151.mp3|||It's like a score in some ways.|
026324|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_152.mp3|||It's a wonderful piece of water.|
026325|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_153.mp3|||Feel the air, the space.|
026326|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_154.mp3|||Therein lies the problem.|

026335|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_163.mp3|||He deserves a second chance.|
026336|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_164.mp3|||He also admitted.|
026337|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_165.mp3|||There was no change in the strategy.|
026338|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_166.mp3|||There's been a mistake.|
026339|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_167.mp3|||It had until tomorrow to comply.|

026355|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_183.mp3|||It was a big departure.|
026356|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_184.mp3|||That's the name of the game, though.|
026357|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_185.mp3|||It's a huge amount.|
026358|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_186.mp3|||The fire was falling from the sky.|
026359|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_187.mp3|||I want my mum.|

026367|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_195.mp3|||It is misleading to compare the two.|
026368|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_196.mp3|||I want a career.|
026369|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_197.mp3|||He said nothing to waiting journalists.|
026370|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_198.mp3|||O Leary was clearly disgusted.|
026371|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_199.mp3|||That's been the case for a while.|
026372|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_200.mp3|||When it is ready, it will be signed.|
026373|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_201.mp3|||All options are on the table.|

026389|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_217.mp3|||It's not a question of talking.|
026390|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_218.mp3|||He was certainly upbeat about his chances.|
026391|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_219.mp3|||Then they killed another three.|
026392|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_220.mp3|||We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|
026393|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_221.mp3|||The six others were injured.|
026394|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_222.mp3|||She has so much to offer.|
026395|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_223.mp3|||They are not the answer to staff shortages.|
026396|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_224.mp3|||It should be a pretty exciting session.|
026397|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_225.mp3|||Gas is too expensive.|
026398|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_226.mp3|||Advice and counselling will be offered.|
026399|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_227.mp3|||Are we going mainstream?|
026400|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_228.mp3|||I could not believe what they were saying.|
026401|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_229.mp3|||The protest will go ahead as planned.|
026402|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_230.mp3|||Who will run the bigger show?|
026403|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_231.mp3|||General, You didn't get a modified.|
026404|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_232.mp3|||I'm not a little girl.|
026405|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_233.mp3|||We have seen the future, and it is different.|
026406|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_234.mp3|||Who does he think will win?|
026407|en-294|en|mp3-48k/p294_235.mp3|||We're talking about one or two years.|

026602|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026603|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026604|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026605|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026606|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
026607|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
026608|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
026609|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

026613|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
026614|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
026615|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026616|en-295|en|mp3-48k/p295_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

027451|en-298|en|mp3-48k/p298_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
027452|en-298|en|mp3-48k/p298_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

029055|en-302|en|mp3-48k/p302_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|

029060|en-302|en|mp3-48k/p302_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|

029723|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
029724|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
029725|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
029726|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
029727|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
029728|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
029729|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
029730|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
029731|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
029732|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
029733|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
029734|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
029735|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
029736|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_025.mp3|||So we will cut their numbers.|

029899|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_189.mp3|||The cost of war is more than that.|
029900|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_190.mp3|||I saw the whole thing.|
029901|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_191.mp3|||There is a demand for another hospice.|

029905|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_195.mp3|||They will have five minutes to decide.|
029906|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_196.mp3|||I see that any day now.|
029907|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_197.mp3|||But who knows?|
029908|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_198.mp3|||He was tough and relentless.|
029909|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_199.mp3|||That would be unlawful.|
029910|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_200.mp3|||This guy is amazing.|
029911|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_201.mp3|||The same goes for McKenna.|
029912|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_202.mp3|||That is no use.|
029913|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_203.mp3|||They will want to perform well.|
029914|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_204.mp3|||We should not worry about other players.|
029915|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_205.mp3|||Ownership was the game.|
029916|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_206.mp3|||Their moment had come, or so they said.|
029917|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_207.mp3|||I love the moment of being first.|

029919|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_209.mp3|||You cannot understand it until you experience it.|
029920|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_210.mp3|||Anything that can be done, the Government will do.|
029921|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_211.mp3|||I sincerely hope that will not change.|
029922|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_212.mp3|||Just don't go looking to be shocked.|
029923|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_213.mp3|||It was total confusion.|
029924|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_214.mp3|||I have learned from him.|

029928|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_218.mp3|||That is why it is so lyrical.|
029929|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_219.mp3|||It isn't a happy memory.|
029930|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_220.mp3|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
029931|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_221.mp3|||Who would be a referee?|
029932|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_222.mp3|||We have a team to reach the final.|

029936|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_226.mp3|||I never agreed with that.|
029937|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_227.mp3|||He was dead on arrival at the hospital.|
029938|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_228.mp3|||I don't think it is vital.|
029939|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_229.mp3|||But he insisted that victory was possible.|
029940|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_230.mp3|||That could run into millions.|
029941|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_231.mp3|||It might not survive the process.|
029942|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_232.mp3|||The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.|
029943|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_233.mp3|||I'm really excited about the album.|
029944|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_234.mp3|||We were desperate to get the game on.|
029945|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_235.mp3|||But there is a possible place.|
029946|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_236.mp3|||You can't have it both ways.|
029947|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_237.mp3|||Offered the gold medal, he declined.|
029948|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_238.mp3|||But they will need to play to score.|
029949|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_239.mp3|||He is a joy to watch.|
029950|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_240.mp3|||They also have good neighbours.|
029951|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_241.mp3|||We are now open.|

029959|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_249.mp3|||The band was good, and it's been a great day.|
029960|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_250.mp3|||ALL IS busy but not much is happening.|
029961|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_251.mp3|||They have the cash to do that.|
029962|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_252.mp3|||This is a defining moment in this parliament.|
029963|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_253.mp3|||He wouldn't have played in all three.|
029964|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_254.mp3|||And that includes the Barnett formula.|
029965|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_255.mp3|||It is a great shame.|
029966|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_256.mp3|||But experts have disputed that statistic.|
029967|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_257.mp3|||The council has been open and transparent.|
029968|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_258.mp3|||I'll never think of myself as a star.|
029969|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_259.mp3|||I felt he was excellent.|
029970|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_260.mp3|||It was a policy they were against.|
029971|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_261.mp3|||The results are sometimes contentious.|
029972|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_262.mp3|||I believe that Scotland has much to gain.|
029973|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_263.mp3|||People have been wonderful beyond belief.|
029974|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_264.mp3|||Had she enjoyed the experience?|
029975|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_265.mp3|||He has changed the country itself.|
029976|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_266.mp3|||The look on his face was something special.|
029977|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_267.mp3|||I can certainly see much better.|
029978|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_268.mp3|||We then went to see the headmaster.|
029979|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_269.mp3|||I needed a little man in the crowd.|
029980|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_270.mp3|||It would then be up to the judge.|
029981|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_271.mp3|||Are we going to stay up?|
029982|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_272.mp3|||People were actually not on his side.|
029983|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_273.mp3|||It was a very difficult period.|
029984|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_274.mp3|||It's all going to clear the debt.|
029985|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_275.mp3|||It used to be less than five minutes.|
029986|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_276.mp3|||It was by the numbers.|
029987|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_277.mp3|||My Dad is a hero.|
029988|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_278.mp3|||It is my fault.|

029990|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_280.mp3|||That used to be another thing of mine.|
029991|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_281.mp3|||At the election we will oppose the euro.|
029992|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_282.mp3|||As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.|
029993|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_283.mp3|||Teachers have been given the offer.|

030001|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_291.mp3|||You are not going in blind.|
030002|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_292.mp3|||You had to go and see him.|
030003|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_293.mp3|||She says she has grown up.|
030004|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_294.mp3|||He met his wife and married in England.|
030005|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_295.mp3|||But it could have been written for her.|
030006|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_296.mp3|||It makes no sense.|
030007|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_297.mp3|||What will they called?|
030008|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_298.mp3|||We come here in peace, for peace.|
030009|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_299.mp3|||He will feel the pain again.|

030015|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_305.mp3|||I can't say that this is very usual.|
030016|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_306.mp3|||He is married, with two children.|
030017|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_307.mp3|||At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.|

030021|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_311.mp3|||It is a potential factor.|
030022|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_312.mp3|||The working families tax credit is far better.|
030023|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_313.mp3|||It added to the reverence.|
030024|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_314.mp3|||It is too early to say.|
030025|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_315.mp3|||It's to do with context.|
030026|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_316.mp3|||David Trimble has sold out.|
030027|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_317.mp3|||Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|
030028|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_318.mp3|||I don't understand it.|
030029|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_319.mp3|||The teenager had been missing for six months.|
030030|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_320.mp3|||He was rejected because he had retired.|
030031|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_321.mp3|||And then we got off the plane.|
030032|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_322.mp3|||I think it is wide open.|
030033|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_323.mp3|||I am totally surprised.|
030034|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_324.mp3|||We are all ecstatic.|
030035|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_325.mp3|||I hope he has learned from it.|
030036|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_326.mp3|||That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.|
030037|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_327.mp3|||You are a gambling man.|
030038|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_328.mp3|||Who honestly expected anything else?|
030039|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_329.mp3|||The search has been called off.|
030040|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_330.mp3|||The matter will come up again.|
030041|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_331.mp3|||Our strategy is straightforward.|
030042|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_332.mp3|||Surely this is not supposed to happen?|
030043|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_333.mp3|||We must recognise that this outfit is unique.|
030044|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_334.mp3|||They were unable to revive him.|
030045|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_335.mp3|||This has come as a shock to everyone.|
030046|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_336.mp3|||Yes, it was too short a night.|
030047|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_337.mp3|||It is not for me, though.|
030048|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_338.mp3|||It really was my favourite.|
030049|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_339.mp3|||That is why this action has been taken.|
030050|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_340.mp3|||They should be looking at his victims.|
030051|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_341.mp3|||There were many positives for this club.|
030052|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_342.mp3|||It's all about money, money, money.|
030053|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_343.mp3|||There wasn't anything in it.|
030054|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_344.mp3|||What do we do for an encore?|
030055|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_345.mp3|||Things start to talk to each other.|

030059|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_349.mp3|||That is a lot of writing.|
030060|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_350.mp3|||There is no excuse for domestic abuse.|
030061|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_351.mp3|||It is no place for a poet.|
030062|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_352.mp3|||There is room for me.|
030063|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_353.mp3|||My life is in the ballet.|
030064|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_354.mp3|||For next season, we have time to restructure.|
030065|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_355.mp3|||The truth, of course, is very different.|

030067|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_357.mp3|||These will take a little time to develop.|
030068|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_358.mp3|||This is not a birthday party.|
030069|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_359.mp3|||Darren is very, very good.|
030070|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_360.mp3|||It's a drop in the bucket.|

030072|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_362.mp3|||I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|

030074|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_364.mp3|||That's how she wants to remember him.|
030075|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_365.mp3|||There was no disruption to services.|
030076|en-304|en|mp3-48k/p304_366.mp3|||We talk about effective military action.|

030141|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
030142|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

030145|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
030146|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
030147|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
030148|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

030152|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
030153|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
030154|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
030155|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
030156|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
030157|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
030158|en-305|en|mp3-48k/p305_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

030927|en-307|en|mp3-48k/p307_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

031829|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_081.mp3|||But it took a lot of bottle.|
031830|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_082.mp3|||They don't work anymore anyway.|

031888|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_140.mp3|||However, they will only be found in the wild.|
031889|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_141.mp3|||They receive a high profile in the media.|

031936|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_189.mp3|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|

031945|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_198.mp3|||She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.|
031946|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_199.mp3|||Or so we have long assumed.|
031947|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_200.mp3|||They responded with victories.|
031948|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_201.mp3|||That was the personal impulse.|
031949|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_202.mp3|||I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.|
031950|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_203.mp3|||But first it goes out on TV.|
031951|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_204.mp3|||What is the truth about the cow?|
031952|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_205.mp3|||They will want to watch a winning team.|

031955|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_208.mp3|||This will be just another tax on motorists.|
031956|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_209.mp3|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
031957|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_210.mp3|||One must hope not!|

031966|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_219.mp3|||Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.|
031967|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_220.mp3|||We will not break even.|
031968|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_221.mp3|||We will look into it.|
031969|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_222.mp3|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
031970|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_223.mp3|||But he's not afraid to take risks.|
031971|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_224.mp3|||Some of his family still live there.|
031972|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_225.mp3|||However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.|
031973|en-310|en|mp3-48k/p310_226.mp3|||However, it very nearly went wrong.|

032178|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032179|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032180|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032181|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032182|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.|
032183|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032184|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032185|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
032186|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

032188|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032189|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032190|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032191|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
032192|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
032193|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032194|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
032195|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

032200|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_029.mp3|||It was a matter of chance.|
032201|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_030.mp3|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
032202|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_031.mp3|||Miller was every bit as happy.|

032211|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_040.mp3|||We cannot go on in this fashion.|
032212|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_041.mp3|||We must learn to finish.|
032213|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_042.mp3|||There can be no two ways about it.|
032214|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_043.mp3|||I knew my contract was up this year.|

032344|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_173.mp3|||This is a very interesting move.|

032346|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_175.mp3|||His only reply was a laugh.|

032348|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_177.mp3|||What kind of festival is proposed?|
032349|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_178.mp3|||I was delighted with every one of them.|
032350|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_179.mp3|||Sure the COE is a cracking band.|
032351|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_180.mp3|||Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.|
032352|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_181.mp3|||That will help my case a bit.|
032353|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_182.mp3|||It was entirely justified.|
032354|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_183.mp3|||He looked at me before replying.|
032355|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_184.mp3|||This may be perfectly innocent.|
032356|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_185.mp3|||It feels that the game is off.|
032357|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_186.mp3|||There will be no change in government.|
032358|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_187.mp3|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
032359|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_188.mp3|||But we still don't know.|
032360|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_189.mp3|||Who do you think you are?|
032361|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_190.mp3|||Glasgow is a tour de force.|
032362|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_191.mp3|||I have no battle with the Scots.|
032363|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_192.mp3|||It is all credit to them today.|
032364|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_193.mp3|||I have done ever since it was published.|
032365|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_194.mp3|||Nobody could survive on that.|
032366|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_195.mp3|||They seem to turn up for them.|
032367|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_196.mp3|||They were kept there for a summer.|
032368|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_197.mp3|||He confirmed there had been no warning.|
032369|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_198.mp3|||It is that sort of film.|
032370|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_199.mp3|||She was not hard done by.|
032371|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_200.mp3|||Can you believe it?|
032372|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_201.mp3|||I want the Commonwealth and European titles.|
032373|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_202.mp3|||They are now out in the cold.|
032374|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_203.mp3|||However, planners should be taking the lead.|
032375|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_204.mp3|||I'm very frightened of the dark.|
032376|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_205.mp3|||Our message was inclusive.|
032377|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_206.mp3|||This has been a shock.|
032378|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_207.mp3|||Yet the survey has been cautious.|
032379|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_208.mp3|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
032380|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_209.mp3|||There has also been some Scots input.|
032381|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_210.mp3|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
032382|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_211.mp3|||There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.|
032383|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_212.mp3|||But who will buy it?|
032384|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_213.mp3|||It had to be more flexible.|
032385|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_214.mp3|||Openness is always the best way.|
032386|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_215.mp3|||It wouldn't go off.|
032387|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_216.mp3|||It can be halted.|
032388|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_217.mp3|||This was a lot of numbers.|
032389|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_218.mp3|||Would it be good for the Nationwide League?|
032390|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_219.mp3|||Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.|
032391|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_220.mp3|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|

032393|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_222.mp3|||The professor said the results were positive.|
032394|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_223.mp3|||I think he's the favourite, no question.|
032395|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_224.mp3|||But it's just great to have won.|
032396|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_225.mp3|||And it paid off.|
032397|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_226.mp3|||Gone with them is any sense of narrative.|
032398|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_227.mp3|||Those Were The Days, indeed.|
032399|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_228.mp3|||I never made any offer to Mark.|
032400|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_229.mp3|||It should be scrapped.|
032401|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_230.mp3|||He admitted the asylum system was not working.|
032402|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_231.mp3|||They are just trying to cover up.|
032403|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_232.mp3|||We have to defend ourselves.|
032404|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_233.mp3|||I came here this week to work.|
032405|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_234.mp3|||Where do we go from here?|
032406|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_235.mp3|||Barry Ferguson is one of them.|
032407|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_236.mp3|||He gets his moment.|
032408|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_237.mp3|||This was an option from the beginning.|
032409|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_238.mp3|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
032410|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_239.mp3|||It's not a party, no, no.|
032411|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_240.mp3|||It's not that clear-cut.|
032412|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_241.mp3|||It may not be life long.|
032413|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_242.mp3|||It was just above the roof.|
032414|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_243.mp3|||It has changed, and not for the better.|
032415|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_244.mp3|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
032416|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_245.mp3|||Everyone must be focused on the league.|
032417|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_246.mp3|||The English are coming.|
032418|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_247.mp3|||I believe in theatre.|

032420|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_249.mp3|||However, many of their victories have been close affairs.|
032421|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_250.mp3|||It's time to say enough is enough.|
032422|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_251.mp3|||Mentally, you have to be tough.|
032423|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_252.mp3|||He has to pull back from the brink.|

032425|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_254.mp3|||That's my daughter acting.|
032426|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_255.mp3|||The film has also been superbly designed.|
032427|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_256.mp3|||The performance was really, really immense.|
032428|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_257.mp3|||Faces from the Eighties.|
032429|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_258.mp3|||The family baton is handed on.|
032430|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_259.mp3|||How can this be?|
032431|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_260.mp3|||We are still alive and kicking.|
032432|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_261.mp3|||I want to go now.|
032433|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_262.mp3|||There are many questions to be answered.|
032434|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_263.mp3|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
032435|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_264.mp3|||All the children on the roll are genuine.|
032436|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_265.mp3|||They said we were out of touch.|
032437|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_266.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
032438|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_267.mp3|||There is no signature.|
032439|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_268.mp3|||There is no point in denying that.|
032440|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_269.mp3|||The kids are paying the price.|
032441|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_270.mp3|||He said he was delighted by the award.|
032442|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_271.mp3|||They didn't find any substance.|
032443|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_272.mp3|||They still have the dirty work to do.|
032444|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_273.mp3|||I've never seen a game like it.|
032445|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_274.mp3|||It doesn't seem like that long ago.|
032446|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_275.mp3|||He will do very well.|
032447|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_276.mp3|||They also intend to travel today.|
032448|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_277.mp3|||There's a lot of hysteria.|
032449|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_278.mp3|||The casualties were not named.|
032450|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_279.mp3|||I was shaking on the blocks.|
032451|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_280.mp3|||There are two ways to start a festival.|
032452|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_281.mp3|||I am very happy with life.|
032453|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_282.mp3|||Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.|
032454|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_283.mp3|||My office is down there.|
032455|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_284.mp3|||Even then this game was not over.|
032456|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_285.mp3|||Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.|
032457|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_286.mp3|||We also hope to meet the men.|
032458|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_287.mp3|||The defender made an impressive debut.|
032459|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_288.mp3|||It has become very confused.|
032460|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_289.mp3|||Fame and money followed.|
032461|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_290.mp3|||I am not in denial.|
032462|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_291.mp3|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
032463|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_292.mp3|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
032464|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_293.mp3|||There is a solution, she believes.|
032465|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_294.mp3|||So there is a very real dilemma.|
032466|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_295.mp3|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
032467|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_296.mp3|||Then there's the Old Firm.|
032468|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_297.mp3|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
032469|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_298.mp3|||We were in different places, usually in cellars.|
032470|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_299.mp3|||They're not always the same person.|
032471|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_300.mp3|||It would have to be backdated.|
032472|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_301.mp3|||He said he was sorry.|
032473|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_302.mp3|||My position on the euro is quite clear.|
032474|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_303.mp3|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
032475|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_304.mp3|||We have worked well with them for years.|
032476|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_305.mp3|||That was me today.|
032477|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_306.mp3|||That is the consistent approach of the Government.|
032478|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_307.mp3|||That is when we are really effective.|
032479|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_308.mp3|||The director's a genius.|
032480|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_309.mp3|||There was no sign that anything was amiss.|
032481|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_310.mp3|||It was the climax of the thing.|
032482|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_311.mp3|||This is new money.|
032483|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_312.mp3|||We have not given up on the game.|
032484|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_313.mp3|||The decision was left entirely to him.|
032485|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_314.mp3|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
032486|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_315.mp3|||Nobody should believe this story.|
032487|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_316.mp3|||This is not out of choice.|
032488|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_317.mp3|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
032489|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_318.mp3|||But this one has a lot of potential.|
032490|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_319.mp3|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
032491|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_320.mp3|||We'll see what happens.|
032492|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_321.mp3|||This was another video cassette.|
032493|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_322.mp3|||If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.|
032494|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_323.mp3|||It will make a huge difference.|
032495|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_324.mp3|||He pretended not to care.|
032496|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_325.mp3|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
032497|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_326.mp3|||I was in tears in the street.|
032498|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_327.mp3|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
032499|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_328.mp3|||No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.|
032500|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_329.mp3|||But that's not the idea behind this article.|
032501|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_330.mp3|||If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.|
032502|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_331.mp3|||That is why we are here.|
032503|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_332.mp3|||The German had a point to make.|
032504|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_333.mp3|||This time, however, may have been different.|
032505|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_334.mp3|||You have to feel for the guy.|
032506|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_335.mp3|||However, the second goal was about to be delivered.|
032507|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_336.mp3|||Bomber was not amused.|
032508|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_337.mp3|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
032509|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_338.mp3|||Was it just negligent.|
032510|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_339.mp3|||And suddenly it became a free-for-all.|
032511|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_340.mp3|||This Government is cutting taxes.|
032512|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_341.mp3|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
032513|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_342.mp3|||This is a big club.|
032514|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_343.mp3|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
032515|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_344.mp3|||They will now get that support.|
032516|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_345.mp3|||I feel it's time to make the switch.|
032517|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_346.mp3|||It seemed so personal.|
032518|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_347.mp3|||I've no problem with what they said.|
032519|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_348.mp3|||He added that he felt undermined.|
032520|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_349.mp3|||I think we have got the balance right.|

032522|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_351.mp3|||It is physical but it is also good.|
032523|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_352.mp3|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
032524|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_353.mp3|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|

032529|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_358.mp3|||I am greatly encouraged.|
032530|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_359.mp3|||It was like someone had died.|
032531|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_360.mp3|||What does he want him to look like?|

032534|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_363.mp3|||We would have concerns about that.|

032536|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_365.mp3|||It's unusual to say the least.|

032541|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_370.mp3|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
032542|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_371.mp3|||This was a chilling echo.|
032543|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_372.mp3|||They really want to do it.|
032544|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_373.mp3|||And then he laughs.|
032545|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_374.mp3|||I recommend a tour.|
032546|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_375.mp3|||We don't ask for much.|

032550|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_379.mp3|||It feels like a winner already.|
032551|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_380.mp3|||And it covers the spectrum.|
032552|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_381.mp3|||The replacements made a big difference.|
032553|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_382.mp3|||And the winners are.|
032554|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_383.mp3|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
032555|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_384.mp3|||He didn't really, we just made that up.|

032561|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_390.mp3|||For us, that decision was hard to understand.|
032562|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_391.mp3|||I had to calm down.|

032576|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_405.mp3|||It was the same old story.|
032577|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_406.mp3|||I was frustrated here.|
032578|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_407.mp3|||We have reacted well to each other.|

032592|en-311|en|mp3-48k/p311_421.mp3|||It's very difficult and very worrying.|

032596|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
032597|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
032598|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
032599|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
032600|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032601|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032602|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032603|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032604|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
032605|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032606|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032607|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
032608|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
032609|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
032610|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032611|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032612|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032613|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.|
032614|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.|
032615|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032616|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
032617|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
032618|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_025.mp3|||Perhaps that was their mistake.|
032619|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_026.mp3|||This was a rationing decision.|
032620|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_027.mp3|||The way forward is working with other disciplines.|

032628|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_035.mp3|||It was quite distressing for the crew.|
032629|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_036.mp3|||Now the show is for public consumption.|
032630|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_037.mp3|||That decision is now being appealed.|
032631|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_038.mp3|||This is really good news for us.|
032632|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_039.mp3|||I wish it wasn't so, but it is.|
032633|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_040.mp3|||Not so, it transpires.|
032634|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_041.mp3|||I shouldn't have put up with it.|
032635|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_042.mp3|||I think so - he seems to be in good health.|
032636|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_043.mp3|||I think it must be the uniforms.|
032637|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_044.mp3|||This is not a monument to the past.|
032638|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_045.mp3|||I certainly hope not.|
032639|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_046.mp3|||However, there could be more bad weather to come.|
032640|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_047.mp3|||I feel pretty good.|
032641|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_048.mp3|||The group will report back in the summer.|
032642|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_049.mp3|||Back then it was hard to refuse.|
032643|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_050.mp3|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
032644|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_051.mp3|||I was in the zone in the morning.|
032645|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_052.mp3|||We have to break that cycle.|
032646|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_053.mp3|||In fact, it might just be the beginning.|
032647|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_054.mp3|||The children are being very brave.|
032648|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_055.mp3|||They have a car and cannot afford another.|

032654|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_061.mp3|||It was a virus.|
032655|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_062.mp3|||The rest, of course, is history.|
032656|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_063.mp3|||They chose the latter.|
032657|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_064.mp3|||I've not said anything to them, they know.|
032658|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_065.mp3|||All were later allowed home.|
032659|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_066.mp3|||Will you just put it away?|
032660|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_067.mp3|||I think it's more important to have fun.|

032672|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_079.mp3|||The goal will come.|

032709|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_116.mp3|||I am not against a further inquiry.|
032710|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_117.mp3|||Such is the scene of the tragedy.|
032711|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_118.mp3|||It's a double whammy.|
032712|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_119.mp3|||What's the theme?|
032713|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_120.mp3|||We are satisfied that this is the case.|
032714|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_121.mp3|||For me, it was a shattering experience.|
032715|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_122.mp3|||This latter suggestion is very important.|

032719|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_126.mp3|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
032720|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_127.mp3|||What's wrong with that?|
032721|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_128.mp3|||The pain is still acute.|

032730|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_137.mp3|||I was blown out of proportion.|
032731|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_138.mp3|||There was a definite prejudice.|
032732|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_139.mp3|||It's the same with us.|

032740|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_147.mp3|||I've never regretted coming here.|
032741|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_148.mp3|||He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.|

032751|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_158.mp3|||That says something for his strength of character.|

032753|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_160.mp3|||If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|

032766|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_173.mp3|||This remains the party's policy.|
032767|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_174.mp3|||I cannot say anymore.|
032768|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_175.mp3|||They want this research to continue.|

032772|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_179.mp3|||You can't keep them separate.|
032773|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_180.mp3|||I think it can count against you now.|
032774|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_181.mp3|||He was a legend.|
032775|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_182.mp3|||That's when the story first appeared.|
032776|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_183.mp3|||You're going to die.|
032777|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_184.mp3|||There was a substantial explosion.|
032778|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_185.mp3|||He will continue to provide support for them.|
032779|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_186.mp3|||I'm going to see my friend.|
032780|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_187.mp3|||We played too deeply.|
032781|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_188.mp3|||I probably would have been a dancer.|

032783|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_190.mp3|||We're going to see a Government in a hurry.|
032784|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_191.mp3|||He never asked me for money.|
032785|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_192.mp3|||I was a bit nervous.|
032786|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_193.mp3|||There was no question of him not impressing.|
032787|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_194.mp3|||However, we came through.|
032788|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_195.mp3|||I love this tournament.|
032789|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_196.mp3|||He had a heart problem.|
032790|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_197.mp3|||I am desperate to play for Scotland.|
032791|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_198.mp3|||It is a large number.|
032792|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_199.mp3|||We felt at the moment, it was not possible.|
032793|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_200.mp3|||Hear what they have to say.|
032794|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_201.mp3|||Now there's a thought.|
032795|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_202.mp3|||I believe that the answer is simple.|
032796|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_203.mp3|||That, he claimed, was essential.|
032797|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_204.mp3|||I was on the pitch and everything.|
032798|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_205.mp3|||They told him to go to drama school.|
032799|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_206.mp3|||Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|
032800|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_207.mp3|||Let us hope so.|
032801|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_208.mp3|||She looked very settled.|
032802|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_209.mp3|||Of course he was right!|
032803|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_210.mp3|||The next few months will tell.|
032804|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_211.mp3|||It felt like my support system was leaving.|
032805|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_212.mp3|||But my daughter has got nothing.|
032806|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_213.mp3|||You can see their point.|
032807|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_214.mp3|||Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.|
032808|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_215.mp3|||The dangers are very obvious.|
032809|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_216.mp3|||There were no casualties.|
032810|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_217.mp3|||Is it in the right place?|
032811|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_218.mp3|||I played well in my time there.|
032812|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_219.mp3|||A teacher is, really, about unity.|
032813|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_220.mp3|||They are still going to be impulsive.|
032814|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_221.mp3|||I love you so very much.|
032815|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_222.mp3|||The scheme was simple but extremely effective.|
032816|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_223.mp3|||He is a very nice man.|
032817|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_224.mp3|||We want to sort it out.|
032818|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_225.mp3|||Sean Connery did not disappoint.|
032819|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_226.mp3|||Such a city does not exist.|
032820|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_227.mp3|||It made me determined to get back.|
032821|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_228.mp3|||It was no avail.|
032822|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_229.mp3|||We're going to see more extreme weather.|
032823|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_230.mp3|||He was replaced by John Spencer.|
032824|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_231.mp3|||Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.|
032825|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_232.mp3|||That is in the very nature of farming.|
032826|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_233.mp3|||And, also, when he does not have the ball.|
032827|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_234.mp3|||It was worth the wait.|
032828|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_235.mp3|||I love the tradition of vaudeville.|
032829|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_236.mp3|||It will take place in July.|
032830|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_237.mp3|||We must not give in to the bastards.|
032831|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_238.mp3|||This is a major step forward for carers.|
032832|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_239.mp3|||I think it was his parents.|
032833|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_240.mp3|||Our commitment is to move forward.|
032834|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_241.mp3|||Partly, it is his own fault.|
032835|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_242.mp3|||It's a personal matter.|
032836|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_243.mp3|||That's where it all started.|
032837|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_244.mp3|||I won't go back.|
032838|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_245.mp3|||Why has it taken so long?|
032839|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_246.mp3|||You make the choice.|
032840|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_247.mp3|||And does it?|
032841|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_248.mp3|||I was proud of our lads.|
032842|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_249.mp3|||These will finally be corrected by next week.|
032843|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_250.mp3|||This kind of traffic is commonplace.|
032844|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_251.mp3|||All would be under threat.|
032845|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_252.mp3|||Was it a foul?|
032846|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_253.mp3|||He leaves a beat.|
032847|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_254.mp3|||Perhaps it was her demeanour.|
032848|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_255.mp3|||It lasted longer than we thought.|
032849|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_256.mp3|||Promises were not kept.|
032850|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_257.mp3|||It hasn't happened, but other things have.|
032851|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_258.mp3|||The claim was denied by first minister.|
032852|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_259.mp3|||Who is he?|
032853|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_260.mp3|||It has to be long-term commitment.|
032854|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_261.mp3|||It was that bad, that low.|
032855|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_262.mp3|||That would be a big mistake.|
032856|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_263.mp3|||His arrival could be the making of them.|
032857|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_264.mp3|||After all, this is the start of the giving age.|
032858|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_265.mp3|||I said How much?|
032859|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_266.mp3|||You are a liar.|
032860|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_267.mp3|||The scheme has been funded by the Government.|
032861|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_268.mp3|||We're still talking about it.|
032862|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_269.mp3|||She would say he was still the best.|
032863|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_270.mp3|||He finished the night in a cell.|
032864|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_271.mp3|||I'm not afraid of that.|
032865|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_272.mp3|||I don't know what he was shouting.|
032866|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_273.mp3|||It is the icing on the cake.|
032867|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_274.mp3|||It was a new ball game.|
032868|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_275.mp3|||The people here are quite reserved.|
032869|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_276.mp3|||Previously police had said that schools were safe.|
032870|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_277.mp3|||Our legal advice is clear.|
032871|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_278.mp3|||The past is history, not destiny.|
032872|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_279.mp3|||These were the edited highlights.|
032873|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_280.mp3|||All were within range of Israeli cities.|
032874|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_281.mp3|||They were totally behind it.|
032875|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_282.mp3|||However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.|

033002|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_410.mp3|||He supported the decision to review the decision.|
033003|en-312|en|mp3-48k/p312_411.mp3|||It was chaotic and frightening.|

033017|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
033018|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033019|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033020|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
033021|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
033022|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033023|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033024|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
033025|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

033028|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033029|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033030|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033031|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033032|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.|
033033|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033034|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
033035|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
033036|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_025.mp3|||They will be dealt with.|
033037|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_026.mp3|||It is never an easy game.|

033049|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_038.mp3|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
033050|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_039.mp3|||It helped me to get noticed.|
033051|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_040.mp3|||They hit me in the head.|
033052|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_041.mp3|||But he is not using them.|
033053|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_042.mp3|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
033054|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_043.mp3|||We are not moving in.|
033055|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_044.mp3|||We have not had a formal request.|
033056|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_045.mp3|||I never had a childhood.|
033057|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_046.mp3|||Its effect on humans is not yet known.|
033058|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_047.mp3|||We offered something different.|
033059|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_048.mp3|||We were very much a happy family.|
033060|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_049.mp3|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
033061|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_050.mp3|||My brother's buried under there.|
033062|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_051.mp3|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
033063|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_052.mp3|||What were they?|
033064|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_053.mp3|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
033065|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_054.mp3|||He will be judged by his actions.|
033066|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_055.mp3|||Her role in it was small.|
033067|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_056.mp3|||I've really noticed that this week.|
033068|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_057.mp3|||We might be back next year.|
033069|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_058.mp3|||In a way he was.|
033070|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_059.mp3|||It's back to how it used to be.|
033071|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_060.mp3|||It is not a standing army.|
033072|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_061.mp3|||The firm was down and almost out.|
033073|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_062.mp3|||They said they were only young men.|
033074|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_063.mp3|||I was chosen to do this.|
033075|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_064.mp3|||I learned a lot from that.|
033076|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_065.mp3|||The house was so well alight.|
033077|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_066.mp3|||He got his degree.|
033078|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_067.mp3|||Sandy was very active.|
033079|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_068.mp3|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
033080|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_069.mp3|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
033081|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_070.mp3|||I'm confident of the outcome this week.|
033082|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_071.mp3|||There were no formal announcements.|
033083|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_072.mp3|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
033084|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_073.mp3|||It really has left the town in shock.|
033085|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_074.mp3|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
033086|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_075.mp3|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
033087|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_076.mp3|||This was much worse.|
033088|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_077.mp3|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
033089|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_078.mp3|||We are confident of taking that back.|
033090|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_079.mp3|||They must be kept on the ground.|
033091|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_080.mp3|||Did they give any good advice?|
033092|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_081.mp3|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
033093|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_082.mp3|||This does not help.|
033094|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_083.mp3|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
033095|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_084.mp3|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
033096|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_085.mp3|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
033097|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_086.mp3|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
033098|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_087.mp3|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
033099|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_088.mp3|||This could be her way forward.|
033100|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_089.mp3|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
033101|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_090.mp3|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
033102|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_091.mp3|||It's a very, very special day.|
033103|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_092.mp3|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
033104|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_093.mp3|||There's also the point.|
033105|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_094.mp3|||It was forced to divert.|
033106|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_095.mp3|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
033107|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_096.mp3|||That's the National Grid.|
033108|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_097.mp3|||But Allen is deadly serious.|
033109|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_098.mp3|||Peter doesn't want to leave.|
033110|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_099.mp3|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
033111|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_100.mp3|||They've just got to believe in themselves.|
033112|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_101.mp3|||This is my personal assessment.|
033113|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_102.mp3|||There was no trouble at all.|
033114|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_103.mp3|||Although, you never know.|
033115|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_104.mp3|||We shall be victorious.|
033116|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_105.mp3|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
033117|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_106.mp3|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
033118|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_107.mp3|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
033119|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_108.mp3|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
033120|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_109.mp3|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
033121|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_110.mp3|||I took the gun.|
033122|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_111.mp3|||It's just one of those things.|
033123|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_112.mp3|||A web site is planned for November.|
033124|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_113.mp3|||We played so well at times.|
033125|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_114.mp3|||I was very fortunate.|
033126|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_115.mp3|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
033127|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_116.mp3|||We act because we must.|
033128|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_117.mp3|||They will be destroyed.|
033129|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_118.mp3|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
033130|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_119.mp3|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
033131|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_120.mp3|||The Tory party will last.|
033132|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_121.mp3|||It was a journey into a new life.|
033133|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_122.mp3|||It's a way of making a mark.|
033134|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_123.mp3|||There is a great carry over value.|
033135|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_124.mp3|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
033136|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_125.mp3|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
033137|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_126.mp3|||What's the point?|
033138|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_127.mp3|||Why is this?|
033139|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_128.mp3|||What has changed since then?|
033140|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_129.mp3|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
033141|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_130.mp3|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|
033142|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_131.mp3|||I'd love to be at the World Cup.|
033143|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_132.mp3|||He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.|
033144|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_133.mp3|||I'm sorry to hear this news.|
033145|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_134.mp3|||At some point, the bill will be presented.|
033146|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_135.mp3|||I mean it happens.|
033147|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_136.mp3|||This week is a perfect example.|
033148|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_137.mp3|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
033149|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_138.mp3|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|
033150|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_139.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
033151|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_140.mp3|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
033152|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_141.mp3|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
033153|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_142.mp3|||It's typical of me.|
033154|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_143.mp3|||However, consumers may take a different view.|
033155|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_144.mp3|||They played it like a cup final.|
033156|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_145.mp3|||However, it's not all bad news for women.|
033157|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_146.mp3|||But the championship is not over yet.|
033158|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_147.mp3|||We haven't found out anything different.|
033159|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_148.mp3|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
033160|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_149.mp3|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
033161|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_150.mp3|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
033162|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_151.mp3|||Surely it can do better than that?|
033163|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_152.mp3|||I am ashamed of them.|
033164|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_153.mp3|||Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.|
033165|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_154.mp3|||The salary changes are long overdue.|
033166|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_155.mp3|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
033167|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_156.mp3|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
033168|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_157.mp3|||I'm not blaming audiences.|
033169|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_158.mp3|||Who was on the panel?|
033170|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_159.mp3|||They may differ on other issues.|
033171|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_160.mp3|||He'd never run the distance before.|
033172|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_161.mp3|||I can make one further announcement.|
033173|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_162.mp3|||The General Election is all to play for.|
033174|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_163.mp3|||It was a fiery game.|
033175|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_164.mp3|||Agents and coaches must be paid.|
033176|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_165.mp3|||Golf is a game of honour and ethics.|
033177|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_166.mp3|||Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.|
033178|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_167.mp3|||It will not be easy for him.|
033179|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_168.mp3|||This one is a special case.|
033180|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_169.mp3|||But what are the songs about?|
033181|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_170.mp3|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
033182|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_171.mp3|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
033183|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_172.mp3|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
033184|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_173.mp3|||The stadium was full.|
033185|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_174.mp3|||Dewar is the medium.|
033186|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_175.mp3|||It was that kind of night.|
033187|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_176.mp3|||It is very much a matter for them.|
033188|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_177.mp3|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
033189|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_178.mp3|||Any error is severely punished.|
033190|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_179.mp3|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
033191|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_180.mp3|||We won't do that.|
033192|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_181.mp3|||I hope we do.|
033193|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_182.mp3|||From now on there is no hiding place.|
033194|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_183.mp3|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
033195|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_184.mp3|||He quit in October.|
033196|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_185.mp3|||The United Nations must act.|
033197|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_186.mp3|||Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.|
033198|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_187.mp3|||Her daughter is getting married.|
033199|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_188.mp3|||His manager blamed the referee.|
033200|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_189.mp3|||They were that poor.|
033201|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_190.mp3|||Patients will be partners in decision making.|
033202|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_191.mp3|||We have understood the problems for some time.|
033203|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_192.mp3|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
033204|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_193.mp3|||All these things have an impact.|
033205|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_194.mp3|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
033206|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_195.mp3|||They believed it worked.|
033207|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_196.mp3|||After that, though, we're still waiting to see.|
033208|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_197.mp3|||They should feel ashamed.|
033209|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_198.mp3|||This is a really serious issue.|
033210|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_199.mp3|||So they will settle again.|
033211|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_200.mp3|||How do we get more people in?|
033212|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_201.mp3|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
033213|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_202.mp3|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
033214|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_203.mp3|||This is not a European Army.|
033215|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_204.mp3|||Election results are expected soon.|
033216|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_205.mp3|||So she told him.|
033217|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_206.mp3|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
033218|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_207.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
033219|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_208.mp3|||It was good to score the goal today.|
033220|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_209.mp3|||The night is young.|
033221|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_210.mp3|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
033222|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_211.mp3|||I suspect that it will.|
033223|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_212.mp3|||But there's no eye contact.|
033224|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_213.mp3|||The squad will be the same for France.|
033225|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_214.mp3|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
033226|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_215.mp3|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
033227|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_216.mp3|||We're still paying the price for that.|
033228|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_217.mp3|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
033229|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_218.mp3|||It's not a wish list.|
033230|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_219.mp3|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
033231|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_220.mp3|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
033232|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_221.mp3|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
033233|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_222.mp3|||If not, he should go home.|
033234|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_223.mp3|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
033235|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_224.mp3|||There is no margin for error.|
033236|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_225.mp3|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
033237|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_226.mp3|||From our point of view, it's the right time.|
033238|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_227.mp3|||That figure will always remain with me.|
033239|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_228.mp3|||And then a funny thing happened.|
033240|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_229.mp3|||It doesn't take much.|
033241|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_230.mp3|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
033242|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_231.mp3|||It was a stunning strike.|
033243|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_232.mp3|||It is a technique.|
033244|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_233.mp3|||They hold on for many years.|
033245|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_234.mp3|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
033246|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_235.mp3|||My body is exhausted.|
033247|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_236.mp3|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
033248|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_237.mp3|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
033249|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_238.mp3|||There is nothing to fear.|
033250|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_239.mp3|||I was an athlete.|
033251|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_240.mp3|||Life was like a timetable.|
033252|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_241.mp3|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
033253|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_242.mp3|||I tried to push him away.|
033254|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_243.mp3|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
033255|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_244.mp3|||This was done by the council staff.|
033256|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_245.mp3|||The truth is otherwise.|
033257|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_246.mp3|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
033258|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_247.mp3|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
033259|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_248.mp3|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
033260|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_249.mp3|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
033261|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_250.mp3|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
033262|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_251.mp3|||Which, in effect, it is.|
033263|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_252.mp3|||The man became a reporter.|
033264|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_253.mp3|||It is a memorial.|
033265|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_254.mp3|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
033266|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_255.mp3|||Our people are paying high prices.|
033267|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_256.mp3|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
033268|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_257.mp3|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
033269|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_258.mp3|||Or so everyone believed.|
033270|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_259.mp3|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
033271|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_260.mp3|||I read it every year.|
033272|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_261.mp3|||He was in contention almost every week.|
033273|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_262.mp3|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
033274|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_263.mp3|||It's up to Ann.|
033275|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_264.mp3|||We are playing them at their own game.|
033276|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_265.mp3|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
033277|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_266.mp3|||I had trouble with the producers.|
033278|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_267.mp3|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
033279|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_268.mp3|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
033280|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_269.mp3|||The conference is the first test.|
033281|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_270.mp3|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
033282|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_271.mp3|||I expect a rapid response.|
033283|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_272.mp3|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
033284|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_273.mp3|||There is no more money.|
033285|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_274.mp3|||My mother is a widow.|
033286|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_275.mp3|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
033287|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_276.mp3|||There have been different reports from different people.|
033288|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_277.mp3|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
033289|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_278.mp3|||Something was plainly wrong.|
033290|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_279.mp3|||Why should he go anywhere?|
033291|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_280.mp3|||One thing is sure.|
033292|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_281.mp3|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
033293|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_282.mp3|||I'm confident we can do that.|
033294|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_283.mp3|||Funding needs to be long term.|
033295|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_284.mp3|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
033296|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_285.mp3|||I would never even consider it.|
033297|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_286.mp3|||We're talking about the outskirts of London.|
033298|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_287.mp3|||The end result is precisely the same.|
033299|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_288.mp3|||We have it on video.|
033300|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_289.mp3|||I'm not a threat to coaches.|
033301|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_290.mp3|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
033302|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_291.mp3|||It's never over until it's over.|
033303|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_292.mp3|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
033304|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_293.mp3|||This year, it was a little different.|
033305|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_294.mp3|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
033306|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_295.mp3|||We gave them the goal.|
033307|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_296.mp3|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
033308|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_297.mp3|||What's the point of staying sober?|
033309|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_298.mp3|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
033310|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_299.mp3|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
033311|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_300.mp3|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
033312|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_301.mp3|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
033313|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_302.mp3|||I can feel the sound inside.|
033314|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_303.mp3|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
033315|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_304.mp3|||I'm not a fan of books.|
033316|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_305.mp3|||SO now we know the secret.|
033317|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_306.mp3|||It may well have been.|
033318|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_307.mp3|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
033319|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_308.mp3|||It was a simple question.|
033320|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_309.mp3|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
033321|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_310.mp3|||And we've beaten them before.|
033322|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_311.mp3|||Could you put it in writing?|
033323|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_312.mp3|||I'm not a paedophile.|
033324|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_313.mp3|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
033325|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_314.mp3|||But they had to be paid for.|
033326|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_315.mp3|||The odds are that it will.|
033327|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_316.mp3|||But then they scored their fourth.|
033328|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_317.mp3|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
033329|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_318.mp3|||That's the position that the MoD has adopted.|
033330|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_319.mp3|||Why is that?|
033331|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_320.mp3|||Then came the crunch.|
033332|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_321.mp3|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
033333|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_322.mp3|||But will they fall in love?|
033334|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_323.mp3|||As if they ever stopped.|
033335|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_324.mp3|||The referee had a shocking game.|
033336|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_325.mp3|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
033337|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_326.mp3|||For a few years we had good fun.|
033338|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_327.mp3|||Medical staff are with them at the moment.|
033339|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_328.mp3|||It went on to become an annual event.|
033340|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_329.mp3|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
033341|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_330.mp3|||We are now in an election period.|
033342|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_331.mp3|||Everyone's too upset to comment.|
033343|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_332.mp3|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
033344|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_333.mp3|||But when we do it is great.|
033345|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_334.mp3|||She has nothing to say to journalists.|
033346|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_335.mp3|||I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|
033347|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_336.mp3|||He pleaded for caution.|
033348|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_339.mp3|||I can't believe the buzz.|
033349|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_340.mp3|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
033350|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_341.mp3|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
033351|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_342.mp3|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
033352|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_343.mp3|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
033353|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_344.mp3|||It's a question of perception.|
033354|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_345.mp3|||Staff have been informed.|
033355|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_346.mp3|||My heart is not so sure.|
033356|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_347.mp3|||This morning was very quiet.|
033357|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_348.mp3|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
033358|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_349.mp3|||It's been handled entirely properly.|
033359|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_350.mp3|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
033360|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_351.mp3|||That might help a bit.|
033361|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_352.mp3|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
033362|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_353.mp3|||He was made redundant in February of last year.|
033363|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_354.mp3|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
033364|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_355.mp3|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
033365|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_356.mp3|||You've obviously got an answer to it.|
033366|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_357.mp3|||It seems very odd.|
033367|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_358.mp3|||Closure is not one of them.|
033368|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_359.mp3|||The hotel was huge.|
033369|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_360.mp3|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
033370|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_361.mp3|||Well, you can have a tree.|
033371|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_362.mp3|||It was the same at Twickenham.|
033372|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_363.mp3|||This is an internal matter.|
033373|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_364.mp3|||I'm amazed at what he's done.|
033374|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_365.mp3|||They took a risk.|
033375|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_366.mp3|||The idea was presented to me.|
033376|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_367.mp3|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
033377|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_368.mp3|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
033378|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_369.mp3|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
033379|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_370.mp3|||The hearing was fair.|
033380|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_371.mp3|||I see it as my job.|
033381|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_372.mp3|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
033382|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_373.mp3|||Frank Warren is a great man.|
033383|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_374.mp3|||I'm a little bit tired.|
033384|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_375.mp3|||That was never their agenda.|
033385|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_376.mp3|||She died at her home.|
033386|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_377.mp3|||She's currently in foster care.|
033387|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_378.mp3|||That's the only thing that matters.|
033388|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_379.mp3|||I enjoy the creative process.|
033389|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_380.mp3|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
033390|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_381.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
033391|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_382.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
033392|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_383.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
033393|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_384.mp3|||We have been preparing all year.|
033394|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_385.mp3|||We could learn a lot from them.|
033395|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_386.mp3|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
033396|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_387.mp3|||Sure, we have problems.|
033397|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_388.mp3|||I was released after six days.|
033398|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_389.mp3|||That time is not far away.|
033399|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_390.mp3|||I may think about performing it.|
033400|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_391.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
033401|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_392.mp3|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
033402|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_393.mp3|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
033403|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_394.mp3|||You can't go back and change things.|
033404|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_395.mp3|||It's time to fight a decisive battle.|
033405|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_396.mp3|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
033406|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_397.mp3|||Instead, it's back to the drawing board.|
033407|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_398.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
033408|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_399.mp3|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
033409|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_400.mp3|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
033410|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_401.mp3|||I found that much more challenging.|
033411|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_402.mp3|||This fight is not going to go away.|
033412|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_403.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|
033413|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_404.mp3|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
033414|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_405.mp3|||The Open champion is back.|
033415|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_406.mp3|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
033416|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_407.mp3|||As, indeed, they would be.|
033417|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_408.mp3|||I want to keep him.|
033418|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_409.mp3|||He deserves a top team.|
033419|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_410.mp3|||I knew people on that committee.|
033420|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_411.mp3|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
033421|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_412.mp3|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
033422|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_413.mp3|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
033423|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_414.mp3|||We never agreed to it.|
033424|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_415.mp3|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
033425|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_416.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
033426|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_417.mp3|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
033427|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_418.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
033428|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_419.mp3|||I didn't play all that well.|
033429|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_420.mp3|||Who can tell?|
033430|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_421.mp3|||It appears to have been closed down.|
033431|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_422.mp3|||Now, that is a good deal.|
033432|en-313|en|mp3-48k/p313_423.mp3|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
033433|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
033434|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
033435|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
033436|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
033437|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
033438|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
033439|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033440|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033441|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
033442|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
033443|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033444|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033445|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
033446|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
033447|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
033448|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
033449|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033450|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033451|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033452|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033453|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
033454|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033455|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
033456|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
033457|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_025.mp3|||The Scots are, however, in good company.|
033458|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_026.mp3|||He was born in London of Scottish parents.|
033459|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_027.mp3|||Her condition last night was described as critical.|
033460|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_028.mp3|||Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.|
033461|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_029.mp3|||Four other charges were dropped.|
033462|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_030.mp3|||I believe in the Church.|
033463|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_031.mp3|||We are just being flooded.|
033464|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_032.mp3|||It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.|
033465|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_033.mp3|||They tend to be easily influenced by others.|
033466|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_034.mp3|||It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.|
033467|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_035.mp3|||Well, what do you know?|
033468|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_036.mp3|||But she was very human.|
033469|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_037.mp3|||There are some serious ethical issues involved.|
033470|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_038.mp3|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
033471|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_039.mp3|||His concern is only for the future.|
033472|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_040.mp3|||We have reacted well to each other.|
033473|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_041.mp3|||Pupils and staff were sent home early.|
033474|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_042.mp3|||It is all about people being assaulted, abused.|
033475|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_043.mp3|||I'm delighted with how he has come through.|
033476|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_044.mp3|||In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.|
033477|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_045.mp3|||He will emerge as a world leader.|
033478|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_046.mp3|||That view has not altered.|
033479|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_047.mp3|||I only half believe it.|
033480|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_048.mp3|||It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|
033481|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_049.mp3|||All the oil companies are talking together.|
033482|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_050.mp3|||We have no choice but to shut down.|
033483|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_051.mp3|||I'm feeling pretty good.|
033484|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_052.mp3|||The prognosis is excellent.|
033485|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_053.mp3|||Rangers deserved to beat us.|
033486|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_054.mp3|||That, though, is the measure of the man.|
033487|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_055.mp3|||It was developed in the Gulf War.|
033488|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_056.mp3|||Sub Not Used, MacKay.|
033489|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_057.mp3|||It is not normal practice.|
033490|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_058.mp3|||But he just carried on anyway.|
033491|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_059.mp3|||The spirit in the squad is certainly good.|
033492|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_060.mp3|||What happens next?|
033493|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_061.mp3|||I would not want to be young again.|
033494|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_062.mp3|||Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|
033495|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_063.mp3|||I'm astonished the men were not injured.|
033496|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_064.mp3|||There are schoolboys in uniform.|
033497|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_065.mp3|||Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.|
033498|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_066.mp3|||They were later discharged from hospital.|
033499|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_067.mp3|||Let's see that increase over the years.|
033500|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_068.mp3|||I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.|
033501|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_069.mp3|||They knew they shouldn't have been there.|
033502|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_070.mp3|||These findings would be made public.|
033503|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_071.mp3|||It's the most beautiful place on earth.|
033504|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_072.mp3|||I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|
033505|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_073.mp3|||You can't go on forever.|
033506|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_074.mp3|||All the lads are totally focused on that.|
033507|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_075.mp3|||So far this season this approach is working.|
033508|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_076.mp3|||I have got a knife.|
033509|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_077.mp3|||If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.|
033510|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_078.mp3|||What did we learn?|
033511|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_079.mp3|||I go home only once.|
033512|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_080.mp3|||I'm not going to answer that right now.|
033513|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_081.mp3|||It had a gigantic effect.|
033514|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_082.mp3|||On that basis, he would set it aside.|
033515|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_083.mp3|||I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|
033516|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_084.mp3|||Bin Laden was not mentioned.|
033517|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_085.mp3|||Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?|
033518|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_086.mp3|||The team this year is going places.|
033519|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_087.mp3|||It opens the door to the Champions League.|
033520|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_088.mp3|||We should do everything at a stroke.|
033521|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_089.mp3|||He had a moustache.|
033522|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_090.mp3|||He has changed my life for ever.|
033523|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_091.mp3|||It plans to return to this field.|
033524|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_092.mp3|||He said because people had invited him.|
033525|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_093.mp3|||Action must be taken urgently.|
033526|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_094.mp3|||They are completely different from each other.|
033527|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_095.mp3|||The money is not really our concern.|
033528|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_096.mp3|||Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|
033529|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_097.mp3|||Correction, knowing him, he might.|
033530|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_098.mp3|||I came up through the ranks.|
033531|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_099.mp3|||Why does she suddenly win everything now?|
033532|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_100.mp3|||His team management was protective.|
033533|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_101.mp3|||He was the deputy editor at the paper.|
033534|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_102.mp3|||The proposal was rejected.|
033535|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_103.mp3|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
033536|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_104.mp3|||We wanted it left for a wee while.|
033537|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_105.mp3|||That would be even more disastrous.|
033538|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_106.mp3|||These guys will not lie down.|
033539|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_107.mp3|||You can expect a hell of a fuss.|
033540|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_108.mp3|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
033541|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_109.mp3|||That is nearly four people every day.|
033542|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_110.mp3|||There are nine people here now.|
033543|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_111.mp3|||Is my wife a racist?|
033544|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_112.mp3|||It is a pity, but you can't have everything.|
033545|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_113.mp3|||This would not be my first choice.|
033546|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_114.mp3|||His wife Margaret was not in court.|
033547|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_115.mp3|||Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|
033548|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_116.mp3|||Which perhaps is just as well.|
033549|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_117.mp3|||It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|
033550|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_118.mp3|||He would just say it was terrible.|
033551|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_119.mp3|||They have got their position, we have got our position.|
033552|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_120.mp3|||That's not fair to the supporters.|
033553|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_121.mp3|||I saw military vehicles in the distance.|
033554|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_122.mp3|||But the killer remains at large.|
033555|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_123.mp3|||It is a great shame.|
033556|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_124.mp3|||There are a lot of examples.|
033557|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_125.mp3|||But it will backfire.|
033558|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_126.mp3|||But then he changed his mind.|
033559|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_127.mp3|||I really hope he thinks that through.|
033560|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_128.mp3|||Police were also perplexed.|
033561|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_129.mp3|||For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|
033562|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_130.mp3|||It's very tragic and traumatic.|
033563|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_131.mp3|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
033564|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_132.mp3|||That's a huge amount.|
033565|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_133.mp3|||The final stage is paranoia.|
033566|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_134.mp3|||I'm not holding the club to ransom.|
033567|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_135.mp3|||Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.|
033568|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_136.mp3|||Folk music is in her blood.|
033569|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_137.mp3|||Pig farmers are completely despondent.|
033570|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_138.mp3|||They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.|
033571|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_139.mp3|||We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.|
033572|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_140.mp3|||I would love it.|
033573|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_141.mp3|||This is the high point of my career.|
033574|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_142.mp3|||That's the sort of game you want.|
033575|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_143.mp3|||My duty is to win.|
033576|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_144.mp3|||Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.|
033577|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_145.mp3|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
033578|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_146.mp3|||Now we look forward to it.|
033579|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_147.mp3|||There is no such thing.|
033580|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_148.mp3|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
033581|en-314|en|mp3-48k/p314_149.mp3|||He was telling me to keep quiet.|

033862|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033863|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033864|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_009.mp3|||There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|

033866|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033867|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033868|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

033872|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033873|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033874|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033875|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033876|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.|
033877|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033878|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

033896|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_042.mp3|||I accept that, but is very upsetting.|
033897|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_043.mp3|||We accept the challenge.|
033898|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_044.mp3|||The question is, Will it be enough?|
033899|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_045.mp3|||After that it is up to the boss.|

033903|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_049.mp3|||So, why does he do it?|
033904|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_050.mp3|||I would love to have him home.|
033905|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_051.mp3|||It is very unfair, and something should be done.|
033906|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_052.mp3|||He had no enemies.|
033907|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_053.mp3|||That is not the case this time.|

033935|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_081.mp3|||The company yesterday refused to comment.|
033936|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_082.mp3|||Most of them have already gone home.|
033937|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_083.mp3|||Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.|
033938|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_084.mp3|||Weaknesses there are, however.|
033939|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_085.mp3|||It is, after all, a very funny play.|
033940|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_086.mp3|||Can you imagine a world without design?|
033941|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_087.mp3|||He was caught and fired.|
033942|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_088.mp3|||I feel confident about the outcome.|
033943|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_089.mp3|||The driver escaped injury.|
033944|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_090.mp3|||Mini rugby is a great thing.|
033945|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_091.mp3|||There was no bad behaviour.|
033946|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_092.mp3|||Today she has been released.|
033947|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_093.mp3|||It's a much bigger problem.|
033948|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_094.mp3|||There are no problems between us at all.|
033949|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_095.mp3|||Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.|
033950|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_096.mp3|||I've had it for the exams.|
033951|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_097.mp3|||I hope it comes out all right.|
033952|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_098.mp3|||I will just have to be patient.|
033953|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_099.mp3|||It's a sensible management decision.|
033954|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_100.mp3|||I kept it very simple.|
033955|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_101.mp3|||The rest was badminton.|
033956|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_102.mp3|||It will take several days.|
033957|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_103.mp3|||We had to push to get a goal.|
033958|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_104.mp3|||That got me out.|
033959|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_105.mp3|||I would just like someone to confess.|
033960|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_106.mp3|||We are making progress on waiting lists.|
033961|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_107.mp3|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
033962|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_108.mp3|||I did not have faith in the procedures.|
033963|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_109.mp3|||I was not a joiner.|
033964|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_110.mp3|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
033965|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_111.mp3|||Until you hit the big games.|
033966|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_112.mp3|||It has until Saturday.|
033967|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_113.mp3|||I've tried to get on with my life.|
033968|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_114.mp3|||She has the biggest part.|
033969|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_115.mp3|||We will win this tie.|
033970|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_116.mp3|||This is totally untrue.|
033971|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_117.mp3|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
033972|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_118.mp3|||I think they have to change that.|
033973|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_119.mp3|||This series is for real.|
033974|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_120.mp3|||It's great news, isn't it.|
033975|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_121.mp3|||It's very ingenious.|
033976|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_122.mp3|||That would depend on the parole board.|
033977|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_123.mp3|||It is all up to the Members.|
033978|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_124.mp3|||The two sets are different.|
033979|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_125.mp3|||And now the pressure is off.|
033980|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_126.mp3|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
033981|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_127.mp3|||Their opening was disastrous.|
033982|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_128.mp3|||The time is up for Iraq to comply.|
033983|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_129.mp3|||There can be no compromise on that demand.|
033984|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_130.mp3|||The following are the principal provisions.|
033985|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_131.mp3|||Too much has already been said.|
033986|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_132.mp3|||Now, however, things are different.|
033987|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_133.mp3|||It was not a beautiful game, was it?|
033988|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_134.mp3|||She is not the world champion.|
033989|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_135.mp3|||It would be difficult to argue with that.|
033990|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_136.mp3|||While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.|
033991|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_137.mp3|||He is a bully.|
033992|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_138.mp3|||The case was taken on by his brother.|
033993|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_139.mp3|||I've won the British.|
033994|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_140.mp3|||And so the cycle continues.|
033995|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_141.mp3|||I don't have many friends.|
033996|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_142.mp3|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
033997|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_143.mp3|||They exist in name alone.|
033998|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_144.mp3|||I am not retiring.|
033999|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_145.mp3|||All will be revealed in due course.|
034000|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_146.mp3|||In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.|
034001|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_147.mp3|||And frankly, it's been a while.|
034002|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_148.mp3|||Feel for five seconds.|
034003|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_149.mp3|||I hope it is a good omen.|
034004|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_150.mp3|||Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.|
034005|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_151.mp3|||They will appear again next week.|
034006|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_152.mp3|||Failure is not an option.|
034007|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_153.mp3|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
034008|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_154.mp3|||You look at that.|
034009|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_155.mp3|||Things begin to spring to life.|
034010|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_156.mp3|||Or was it Some kind of a ham?|
034011|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_157.mp3|||I understood that concern.|
034012|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_158.mp3|||The things writers and directors say!|
034013|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_159.mp3|||I am prepared to step down.|
034014|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_160.mp3|||It was like a dream to be here.|
034015|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_161.mp3|||The four characters could be one somebody suggested.|
034016|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_162.mp3|||Either way, it doesn't bother me.|
034017|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_163.mp3|||It would help to heal the wounds.|
034018|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_164.mp3|||We did not deserve to go through.|
034019|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_165.mp3|||It's got to be in the head.|
034020|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_166.mp3|||It certainly sounded it at times.|
034021|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_167.mp3|||It will be too hot.|
034022|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_168.mp3|||That happens in boxing.|
034023|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_169.mp3|||Consumers will also benefit.|
034024|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_170.mp3|||None of the opinions is good.|
034025|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_171.mp3|||We were hopeful that it would be successful.|
034026|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_172.mp3|||They must not succeed.|
034027|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_173.mp3|||He declined to provide a breakdown.|
034028|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_174.mp3|||But the foundations have been laid.|
034029|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_175.mp3|||I have never seen him like that.|
034030|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_176.mp3|||And you need to be so resourceful.|
034031|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_177.mp3|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.|
034032|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_178.mp3|||She hopes to study in Britain one day.|
034033|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_179.mp3|||Everything in the world was focused on London.|
034034|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_180.mp3|||We played better after the break.|
034035|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_181.mp3|||But this relative success has not been easy.|
034036|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_182.mp3|||It was the same with the Dickens.|
034037|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_183.mp3|||Of course it is still possible.|
034038|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_184.mp3|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|
034039|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_185.mp3|||That, in a way, is the point.|
034040|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_186.mp3|||What is so unusual about this case?|
034041|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_187.mp3|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
034042|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_188.mp3|||That would end it for us.|
034043|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_189.mp3|||Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.|
034044|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_190.mp3|||Sure, he is the best player in the world.|
034045|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_191.mp3|||I just love lessons.|
034046|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_192.mp3|||Retirement is on his mind.|
034047|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_193.mp3|||It's to do with this place.|
034048|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_194.mp3|||The home side didn't stand a chance.|
034049|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_195.mp3|||We shall not be moved.|
034050|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_196.mp3|||The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.|
034051|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_197.mp3|||It is not just the agencies.|
034052|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_198.mp3|||There must be boundaries.|
034053|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_199.mp3|||However, he was later released without charge.|
034054|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_200.mp3|||Arsenal refused to be evicted.|
034055|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_201.mp3|||I watch the other visitors.|
034056|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_202.mp3|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
034057|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_204.mp3|||He confirmed his fitness.|
034058|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_205.mp3|||The gap is narrowing.|
034059|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_206.mp3|||All of us in Scotland should be viligant.|
034060|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_207.mp3|||Both men were uninjured.|
034061|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_208.mp3|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
034062|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_209.mp3|||It is not a financial issue.|
034063|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_210.mp3|||We are in this for the long haul.|
034064|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_211.mp3|||We have a budget in March.|
034065|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_212.mp3|||There was no respite.|
034066|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_213.mp3|||I got very, very tired.|
034067|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_214.mp3|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
034068|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_215.mp3|||They will do their own thing.|
034069|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_216.mp3|||It is too much for me.|
034070|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_217.mp3|||But is this enough to provoke a killing?|
034071|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_218.mp3|||I didn't just walk in and get it.|
034072|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_219.mp3|||We've made a couple of albums.|
034073|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_220.mp3|||We need a much wider debate.|
034074|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_221.mp3|||My attitude is exactly the same as before.|
034075|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_222.mp3|||Look at a computer.|
034076|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_223.mp3|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
034077|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_224.mp3|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
034078|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_225.mp3|||So what could be better than becoming a captain?|
034079|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_226.mp3|||However, it proved to be the turning point.|
034080|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_227.mp3|||However, everyone should do it once in their life.|
034081|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_228.mp3|||In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.|
034082|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_229.mp3|||I waited and waited.|
034083|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_230.mp3|||We all knew it could not be true.|
034084|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_231.mp3|||Its future is uncertain.|
034085|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_232.mp3|||I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.|
034086|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_233.mp3|||It doesn't look good for her.|
034087|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_234.mp3|||She said he did not look too happy.|
034088|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_235.mp3|||We are aware of the problem.|
034089|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_236.mp3|||Where will the elderly go then?|
034090|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_237.mp3|||Then it was changed without notice.|
034091|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_238.mp3|||He had a great game.|
034092|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_239.mp3|||The following year, they asked him again.|
034093|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_240.mp3|||It is the men who create the demand.|
034094|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_241.mp3|||I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.|
034095|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_242.mp3|||Every case is completely different.|
034096|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_243.mp3|||It's a scandal, a disgrace.|
034097|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_244.mp3|||Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.|
034098|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_245.mp3|||However, he said the money had not been wasted.|
034099|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_246.mp3|||It will be fine.|
034100|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_247.mp3|||He should emerge as the winner.|
034101|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_248.mp3|||They are you, the fans.|
034102|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_249.mp3|||We're just waiting for her reaction.|
034103|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_250.mp3|||At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|
034104|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_251.mp3|||What a difference a game can make.|
034105|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_252.mp3|||They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.|
034106|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_253.mp3|||Why do it?|
034107|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_254.mp3|||It opened last month.|
034108|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_255.mp3|||This will be our new beginning.|
034109|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_256.mp3|||If they don't, they might well decide not to play.|
034110|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_257.mp3|||I have totally had enough.|
034111|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_258.mp3|||Hopefully today will be the turning point.|
034112|en-316|en|mp3-48k/p316_259.mp3|||We shall be ready for Rangers.|

034652|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_376.mp3|||I think it was briefly considered.|
034653|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_377.mp3|||And Rangers think they have problems.|
034654|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_378.mp3|||We talk to each other about these matters.|
034655|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_379.mp3|||It's a hidden problem.|
034656|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_380.mp3|||They serve a multitude of purposes.|
034657|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_381.mp3|||There will be two other areas of contention.|
034658|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_382.mp3|||I lost a part of me.|
034659|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_383.mp3|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
034660|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_384.mp3|||Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.|
034661|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_385.mp3|||But he has strong links to Labour.|

034665|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_389.mp3|||It will only work with changes in lifestyle.|
034666|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_390.mp3|||They think that it matters but it doesn't.|
034667|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_391.mp3|||This looks like it is anything but open.|
034668|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_392.mp3|||My only ambition is to enjoy my work.|

034673|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_397.mp3|||What's the theme?|
034674|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_398.mp3|||He takes his time, and won't be rushed.|
034675|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_399.mp3|||It shows that painting is still relevant.|

034678|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_402.mp3|||Davis is very supportive, as a director.|
034679|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_403.mp3|||However, the groups denied the claims.|
034680|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_404.mp3|||It's only tackling congestion.|
034681|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_405.mp3|||And our game is about going forward.|

034687|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_411.mp3|||This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.|
034688|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_412.mp3|||Then one night only three people turn up.|

034697|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_421.mp3|||We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.|
034698|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_422.mp3|||Appointments should be made on merit.|
034699|en-317|en|mp3-48k/p317_423.mp3|||Manchester United are the classic example.|

034703|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034704|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034705|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034706|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034707|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034708|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034709|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034710|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034711|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034712|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034713|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
034714|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034715|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034716|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034717|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034718|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034719|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034720|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
034721|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034722|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_025.mp3|||They will be dealt with.|
034723|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_026.mp3|||It is never an easy game.|
034724|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_027.mp3|||This year it will be Billy Crystal.|
034725|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_028.mp3|||I intend to raise the matter there.|
034726|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_029.mp3|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
034727|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_030.mp3|||We have to put this behind us.|
034728|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_031.mp3|||I thought it was quite good.|
034729|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_032.mp3|||It was important to win the singles.|
034730|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_033.mp3|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
034731|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_034.mp3|||That is impressive by any standards.|
034732|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_035.mp3|||We are doing very well as we are.|
034733|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_036.mp3|||The waiting is over, well almost.|
034734|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_037.mp3|||This was the performance, and the result they needed.|
034735|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_038.mp3|||I'm not allowed to say that, of course.|
034736|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_039.mp3|||It helped to get me noticed.|
034737|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_040.mp3|||They hit me in the head.|
034738|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_041.mp3|||But he is not using them.|
034739|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_042.mp3|||That, though, was just the start of it.|
034740|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_043.mp3|||We are not moving in.|
034741|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_044.mp3|||We have not had a formal request.|
034742|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_045.mp3|||I never had a childhood.|

034744|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_047.mp3|||We offered something different.|
034745|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_048.mp3|||We were very much a happy family.|
034746|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_049.mp3|||He was critically ill in hospital last night.|
034747|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_050.mp3|||My brother is buried under there.|
034748|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_051.mp3|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
034749|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_052.mp3|||What were they?|
034750|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_053.mp3|||It was large enough to fit the wall.|
034751|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_054.mp3|||He will be judged by his actions.|
034752|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_055.mp3|||Her role in it was small.|
034753|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_056.mp3|||I have really noticed that this week.|
034754|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_057.mp3|||We might be back next year.|
034755|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_058.mp3|||In a way he was.|
034756|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_059.mp3|||It's back to how it used to be.|
034757|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_060.mp3|||It is not a standing army.|
034758|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_061.mp3|||The firm was down and almost out.|
034759|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_062.mp3|||They said they were only young men.|
034760|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_063.mp3|||I was chosen to do this.|
034761|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_064.mp3|||I learned a lot from that.|
034762|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_065.mp3|||The house was so well alight.|
034763|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_066.mp3|||He got his degree.|
034764|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_067.mp3|||Sandy was very active.|
034765|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_068.mp3|||However, there is great potential in this right.|
034766|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_069.mp3|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
034767|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_070.mp3|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
034768|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_071.mp3|||There were no formal announcements.|
034769|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_072.mp3|||Before the games it was pretty open.|
034770|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_073.mp3|||It really has left the town in shock.|
034771|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_074.mp3|||But you can go beyond that condition.|
034772|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_075.mp3|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
034773|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_076.mp3|||This was much worse.|
034774|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_077.mp3|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
034775|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_078.mp3|||We are confident of taking that back.|
034776|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_079.mp3|||They must be kept on the ground.|
034777|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_080.mp3|||Did they give any good advice?|
034778|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_081.mp3|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
034779|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_082.mp3|||This does not help.|
034780|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_083.mp3|||I've invented a village in East Lothian.|
034781|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_084.mp3|||That's why the ministers resigned.|
034782|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_085.mp3|||He has lost confidence and weight.|
034783|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_086.mp3|||This process of attrition is expected to continue.|
034784|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_087.mp3|||Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.|
034785|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_088.mp3|||This could be her way forward.|
034786|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_089.mp3|||This gives us a lot of practice.|
034787|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_090.mp3|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
034788|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_091.mp3|||It's a very, very special day.|
034789|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_092.mp3|||The crucial strike was yet to come.|
034790|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_093.mp3|||There's also the point.|
034791|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_094.mp3|||It was forced to divert.|
034792|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_095.mp3|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
034793|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_096.mp3|||That's the National Grid.|

034796|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_099.mp3|||He wouldn't allow that to happen.|
034797|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_100.mp3|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
034798|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_101.mp3|||This is my personal assessment.|
034799|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_102.mp3|||There was no trouble at all.|
034800|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_103.mp3|||Although, you never know.|
034801|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_104.mp3|||We shall be victorious.|
034802|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_105.mp3|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
034803|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_106.mp3|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
034804|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_107.mp3|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
034805|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_108.mp3|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
034806|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_109.mp3|||Nothing is being offered in exchange.|
034807|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_110.mp3|||I took the gun.|
034808|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_111.mp3|||It's just one of those things.|

034811|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_114.mp3|||I was very fortunate.|
034812|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_115.mp3|||Such a policy would be a disaster.|
034813|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_116.mp3|||We act because we must.|
034814|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_117.mp3|||They will be destroyed.|
034815|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_118.mp3|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
034816|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_119.mp3|||O Neill is reputed to have replied.|
034817|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_120.mp3|||The Tory party will last.|

034819|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_122.mp3|||It's a way of making a mark.|
034820|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_123.mp3|||There is a great carry over value.|
034821|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_124.mp3|||Life, as many people know it, in other words.|
034822|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_125.mp3|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
034823|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_126.mp3|||What's the point?|
034824|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_127.mp3|||Why is this?|
034825|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_128.mp3|||What has changed since then?|
034826|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_129.mp3|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
034827|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_130.mp3|||We need to make more inquiries about that.|

034832|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_135.mp3|||I mean it happens.|
034833|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_136.mp3|||This week is a perfect example.|
034834|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_137.mp3|||This performance has given my confidence a boost.|
034835|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_138.mp3|||Receiving this medal is an honour.|

034837|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_140.mp3|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
034838|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_141.mp3|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
034839|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_142.mp3|||It is typical of me.|
034840|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_143.mp3|||However, consumers may take a different view.|

034842|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_145.mp3|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
034843|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_146.mp3|||But the championship is not over yet.|
034844|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_147.mp3|||We haven't found out anything different.|
034845|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_148.mp3|||A review of the decision is being sought.|
034846|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_149.mp3|||It will be about commitment, not compliance.|
034847|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_150.mp3|||Still, in the end, it was a fair result.|
034848|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_151.mp3|||Surely it can do better than that?|
034849|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_152.mp3|||I am ashamed of them.|

034852|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_155.mp3|||I, like an idiot, agreed.|
034853|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_156.mp3|||If so, we want to hear from them.|
034854|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_157.mp3|||I am not blaming audiences.|
034855|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_158.mp3|||Who was on the panel?|
034856|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_159.mp3|||They may differ on other issues.|
034857|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_160.mp3|||He had never run the distance before.|

034865|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_168.mp3|||This one is a special case.|
034866|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_169.mp3|||But what are the songs about?|
034867|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_170.mp3|||There is a simmering anger out there.|
034868|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_171.mp3|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
034869|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_172.mp3|||That is not a position they enjoy.|
034870|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_173.mp3|||The stadium was full.|
034871|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_174.mp3|||Dewar is the medium.|
034872|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_175.mp3|||It was that kind of night.|
034873|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_176.mp3|||It is very much a matter for them.|
034874|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_177.mp3|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
034875|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_178.mp3|||Any error is severely punished.|
034876|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_179.mp3|||He's got a great chance of making it.|
034877|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_180.mp3|||We won't do that.|
034878|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_181.mp3|||I hope we do.|
034879|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_182.mp3|||From now on there is no hiding place.|

034888|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_191.mp3|||We have understood the problems for some time.|

034890|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_193.mp3|||All these things have an impact.|
034891|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_194.mp3|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
034892|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_195.mp3|||They believed it worked.|
034893|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_196.mp3|||After that, though, we are still waiting to see.|
034894|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_197.mp3|||They should feel ashamed.|
034895|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_198.mp3|||This is a really serious issue.|
034896|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_199.mp3|||So they will settle again.|
034897|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_200.mp3|||How do we get more people in?|
034898|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_201.mp3|||I'm just looking to take my chances.|
034899|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_202.mp3|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
034900|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_203.mp3|||This is not a European Army.|
034901|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_204.mp3|||Election results are expected soon.|
034902|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_205.mp3|||So she told him.|

034906|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_209.mp3|||The night is young.|
034907|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_210.mp3|||Sadly, too, many of them are similar.|
034908|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_211.mp3|||I suspect that it will.|
034909|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_212.mp3|||But there's no eye contact.|
034910|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_213.mp3|||The squad will be the same for France.|
034911|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_214.mp3|||We are a party for people, not against people.|
034912|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_215.mp3|||Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.|
034913|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_216.mp3|||We are still paying the price for that.|
034914|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_217.mp3|||He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.|
034915|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_218.mp3|||It is not a wish list.|
034916|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_219.mp3|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
034917|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_220.mp3|||Some of the players have not progressed.|
034918|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_221.mp3|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
034919|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_222.mp3|||If not, he should go home.|
034920|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_223.mp3|||We remain committed to it, as does the government.|
034921|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_224.mp3|||There is no margin for error.|
034922|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_225.mp3|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
034923|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_226.mp3|||From our point of view, it is the right time.|
034924|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_227.mp3|||That figure will always remain with me.|
034925|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_228.mp3|||And then a funny thing happened.|
034926|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_229.mp3|||It does not take much.|
034927|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_230.mp3|||She asked us a lot of questions.|
034928|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_231.mp3|||It was a stunning strike.|
034929|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_232.mp3|||It is a technique.|
034930|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_233.mp3|||They hold on for many years.|
034931|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_234.mp3|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
034932|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_235.mp3|||My body is exhausted.|
034933|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_236.mp3|||Home is in the Scottish Borders.|
034934|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_237.mp3|||We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.|
034935|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_238.mp3|||There is nothing to fear.|
034936|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_239.mp3|||I was an athlete.|
034937|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_240.mp3|||Life was like a timetable.|
034938|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_241.mp3|||World leaders expressed their sympathy.|
034939|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_242.mp3|||I tried to push him away.|
034940|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_243.mp3|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|
034941|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_244.mp3|||This was done by the council staff.|
034942|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_245.mp3|||The truth is otherwise.|
034943|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_246.mp3|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
034944|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_247.mp3|||I wanted to put myself on the line.|
034945|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_248.mp3|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
034946|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_249.mp3|||We should be rewarded for producing.|
034947|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_250.mp3|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
034948|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_251.mp3|||Which, in effect, it is.|
034949|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_252.mp3|||The man became a reporter.|
034950|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_253.mp3|||It is a memorial.|
034951|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_254.mp3|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
034952|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_255.mp3|||Our people are paying high prices.|
034953|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_256.mp3|||The reason is partly because of tradition.|
034954|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_257.mp3|||Nor is it likely to do so.|
034955|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_258.mp3|||Or so everyone believed.|
034956|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_259.mp3|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
034957|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_260.mp3|||I read it every year.|
034958|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_261.mp3|||He was in contention almost every week.|
034959|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_262.mp3|||Every school in Scotland should be excellent.|
034960|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_263.mp3|||It is up to Ann.|
034961|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_264.mp3|||We are playing them at their own game.|
034962|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_265.mp3|||By this point the couple were approaching fast.|
034963|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_266.mp3|||I had trouble with the producers.|
034964|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_267.mp3|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
034965|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_268.mp3|||They just thought it was extremely good acting.|
034966|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_269.mp3|||The conference is the first test.|
034967|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_270.mp3|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
034968|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_271.mp3|||I expect a rapid response.|
034969|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_272.mp3|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
034970|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_273.mp3|||There is no more money.|
034971|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_274.mp3|||My mother is a widow.|
034972|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_275.mp3|||The rubble was right up to the ceiling.|
034973|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_276.mp3|||There have been different reports from different people.|
034974|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_277.mp3|||It's an absolute disgrace.|
034975|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_278.mp3|||Something was plainly wrong.|
034976|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_279.mp3|||Why should he go anywhere?|
034977|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_280.mp3|||One thing is sure.|
034978|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_281.mp3|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
034979|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_282.mp3|||I'm confident we can do that.|
034980|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_283.mp3|||Funding needs to be long term.|
034981|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_284.mp3|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
034982|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_285.mp3|||I would never even consider it.|
034983|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_286.mp3|||We are talking about the outskirts of London.|
034984|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_287.mp3|||The end result is precisely the same.|
034985|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_288.mp3|||We have it on video.|
034986|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_289.mp3|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
034987|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_290.mp3|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
034988|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_291.mp3|||It's never over until it's over.|
034989|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_292.mp3|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
034990|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_293.mp3|||This year, it was a little different.|
034991|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_294.mp3|||That, though, is to miss the point.|
034992|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_295.mp3|||We gave them the goal.|
034993|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_296.mp3|||Is being naturally funny enough?|
034994|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_297.mp3|||What's the point of staying sober?|
034995|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_298.mp3|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
034996|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_299.mp3|||The incident is being taken seriously.|
034997|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_300.mp3|||So what's the shape, and what's the detail?|
034998|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_301.mp3|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
034999|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_302.mp3|||I can feel the sound inside.|
035000|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_303.mp3|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|
035001|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_304.mp3|||I am not a fan of books.|
035002|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_305.mp3|||SO now we know the secret.|
035003|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_306.mp3|||It may well have been.|
035004|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_307.mp3|||I never had any confidence in it afterwards.|
035005|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_308.mp3|||It was a simple question.|
035006|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_309.mp3|||I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.|
035007|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_310.mp3|||And we have beaten them before.|
035008|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_311.mp3|||Could you put it in writing?|
035009|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_312.mp3|||I am not a paedophile.|
035010|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_313.mp3|||Some of their movement was excellent.|
035011|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_314.mp3|||But they had to be paid for.|
035012|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_315.mp3|||The odds are that it will.|
035013|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_316.mp3|||But then they scored their fourth.|
035014|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_317.mp3|||They deserve a lot of credit.|
035015|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_318.mp3|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
035016|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_319.mp3|||Why is that?|
035017|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_320.mp3|||Then came the crunch.|
035018|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_321.mp3|||But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.|
035019|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_322.mp3|||But will they fall in love?|
035020|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_323.mp3|||As if they ever stopped.|
035021|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_324.mp3|||The referee had a shocking game.|
035022|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_325.mp3|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
035023|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_326.mp3|||For a few years we had good fun.|
035024|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_327.mp3|||Medical staff are with them at the moment.|
035025|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_328.mp3|||It went on to become an annual event.|
035026|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_329.mp3|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
035027|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_330.mp3|||We are now in an election period.|
035028|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_331.mp3|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
035029|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_332.mp3|||Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.|
035030|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_333.mp3|||But when we do it is great.|
035031|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_334.mp3|||She has nothing to say to journalists.|
035032|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_335.mp3|||I didn't want to fall out with anyone.|
035033|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_336.mp3|||He pleaded for caution.|
035034|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_337.mp3|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
035035|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_338.mp3|||They've been wonderful to me.|
035036|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_339.mp3|||I can't believe the buzz.|
035037|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_340.mp3|||I'm pleased to get through the opening match.|
035038|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_341.mp3|||The picture is the same across Scotland.|
035039|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_342.mp3|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
035040|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_343.mp3|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
035041|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_344.mp3|||It's a question of perception.|
035042|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_345.mp3|||Staff have been informed.|
035043|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_346.mp3|||My heart is not so sure.|
035044|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_347.mp3|||This morning was very quiet.|
035045|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_348.mp3|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
035046|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_349.mp3|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
035047|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_350.mp3|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
035048|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_351.mp3|||That might help a bit.|
035049|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_352.mp3|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
035050|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_353.mp3|||He was made redundant in February last year.|
035051|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_354.mp3|||Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.|
035052|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_355.mp3|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
035053|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_356.mp3|||You have obviously got an answer to it.|
035054|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_357.mp3|||It seems very odd.|
035055|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_358.mp3|||Closure is not one of them.|
035056|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_359.mp3|||The hotel was huge.|
035057|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_360.mp3|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
035058|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_361.mp3|||Well, you can have a tree.|
035059|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_362.mp3|||It was the same at Twickenham.|
035060|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_363.mp3|||This is an internal matter.|
035061|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_364.mp3|||I am amazed at what he's done.|
035062|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_365.mp3|||They took a risk.|
035063|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_366.mp3|||The idea was presented to me.|
035064|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_367.mp3|||The hearing in Edinburgh continues.|
035065|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_368.mp3|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
035066|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_369.mp3|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
035067|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_370.mp3|||The hearing was fair.|
035068|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_371.mp3|||I see it as my job.|
035069|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_372.mp3|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
035070|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_373.mp3|||Frank Warren is a great man.|
035071|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_374.mp3|||I am a little bit tired.|
035072|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_375.mp3|||That was never their agenda.|
035073|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_376.mp3|||She died at her home.|
035074|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_377.mp3|||She is currently in foster care.|
035075|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_378.mp3|||That's the only thing that matters.|
035076|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_379.mp3|||I enjoy the creative process.|
035077|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_380.mp3|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
035078|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_381.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
035079|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_382.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
035080|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_383.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
035081|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_384.mp3|||We have been preparing all year.|
035082|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_385.mp3|||We could learn a lot from them.|
035083|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_386.mp3|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
035084|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_387.mp3|||Sure, we have problems.|
035085|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_388.mp3|||I was released after six days.|
035086|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_389.mp3|||That time is not far away.|
035087|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_390.mp3|||I may think about performing it.|
035088|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_391.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
035089|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_392.mp3|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
035090|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_393.mp3|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
035091|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_394.mp3|||You can't go back and change things.|
035092|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_395.mp3|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|
035093|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_396.mp3|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
035094|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_397.mp3|||Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|
035095|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_398.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
035096|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_399.mp3|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
035097|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_400.mp3|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
035098|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_401.mp3|||I found that much more challenging.|
035099|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_402.mp3|||This fight is not going to go away.|
035100|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_403.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|
035101|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_404.mp3|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
035102|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_405.mp3|||The Open champion is back.|
035103|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_406.mp3|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
035104|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_407.mp3|||As, indeed, they would be.|
035105|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_408.mp3|||I want to keep him.|
035106|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_409.mp3|||He deserves a top team.|
035107|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_410.mp3|||I knew people on that committee.|
035108|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_411.mp3|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
035109|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_412.mp3|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
035110|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_413.mp3|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
035111|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_414.mp3|||We never agreed to it.|
035112|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_415.mp3|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
035113|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_416.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
035114|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_417.mp3|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
035115|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_418.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
035116|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_419.mp3|||I didn't play all that well.|
035117|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_420.mp3|||Who can tell?|
035118|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_421.mp3|||It appears to have been closed down.|
035119|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_422.mp3|||Now, that is a good deal.|
035120|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_423.mp3|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
035121|en-318|en|mp3-48k/p318_424.mp3|||We have no plans for direct action.|
035122|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
035123|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
035124|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
035125|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
035126|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
035127|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
035128|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
035129|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
035130|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
035131|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
035132|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
035133|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
035134|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
035135|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
035136|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
035137|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
035138|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
035139|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
035140|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
035141|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
035142|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
035143|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
035144|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
035145|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
035146|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_025.mp3|||We've made a couple of albums.|
035147|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_026.mp3|||Film music was never the same again.|
035148|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_027.mp3|||It was a deeply moving musical experience.|
035149|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_028.mp3|||Now it is much easier.|
035150|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_029.mp3|||However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.|
035151|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_030.mp3|||This is the best way to do it.|
035152|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_031.mp3|||Its role is not to interfere.|
035153|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_032.mp3|||Leisure centres were also affected.|
035154|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_033.mp3|||Something happened on that island.|
035155|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_034.mp3|||Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.|
035156|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_035.mp3|||Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|
035157|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_036.mp3|||It is misleading to compare the two.|
035158|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_037.mp3|||They discussed how he might get involved.|
035159|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_038.mp3|||And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.|
035160|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_039.mp3|||And it had two seats.|
035161|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_040.mp3|||They were not up to speed.|
035162|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_041.mp3|||We know the quality of life goes up.|
035163|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_042.mp3|||What is next?|
035164|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_043.mp3|||Now they have found out the truth.|
035165|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_044.mp3|||We've still got a say in this.|
035166|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_045.mp3|||The first was excluding Sinn Fein.|
035167|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_046.mp3|||Horses are drawn by ballot.|
035168|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_047.mp3|||We have our supporters and our enemies.|
035169|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_048.mp3|||Mackie was at home, unable to watch.|
035170|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_049.mp3|||So, what's it about?|
035171|en-323|en|mp3-48k/p323_050.mp3|||We have been let down by these people.|

037169|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_382.mp3|||Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.|
037170|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_383.mp3|||Is that where we are?|
037171|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_384.mp3|||We used to keep our business rates.|
037172|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_385.mp3|||It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|
037173|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_386.mp3|||But there's no eye contact.|
037174|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_387.mp3|||There was no energy behind it.|

037181|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_394.mp3|||If not, he should go home.|

037207|en-333|en|mp3-48k/p333_420.mp3|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|

037214|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
037215|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
037216|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
037217|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037218|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037219|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037220|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
037221|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037222|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037223|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037224|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
037225|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
037226|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
037227|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
037228|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
037229|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
037230|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
037231|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
037232|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
037233|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
037234|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
037235|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

037240|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_029.mp3|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
037241|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_030.mp3|||Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.|
037242|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_031.mp3|||It was no surprise.|
037243|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_032.mp3|||It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.|

037250|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_039.mp3|||I think it can count against you now.|
037251|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_040.mp3|||I wanted to win so badly.|
037252|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_041.mp3|||It was an accounting error.|
037253|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_042.mp3|||I had enough on.|
037254|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_043.mp3|||The offer of help is there for anyone.|
037255|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_044.mp3|||There were no passengers on board.|
037256|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_045.mp3|||And we're not there yet.|
037257|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_046.mp3|||No meaningful response was issued.|
037258|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_047.mp3|||And the funny thing is, they usually do.|
037259|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_048.mp3|||Times have changed, but have they improved?|
037260|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_049.mp3|||Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.|
037261|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_050.mp3|||We feel it sends out the wrong message.|
037262|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_051.mp3|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
037263|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_052.mp3|||It is a form of physical exercise.|

037265|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_054.mp3|||But, by that time, of course, it is again.|
037266|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_055.mp3|||It is something that we will put right.|
037267|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_056.mp3|||Why do it?|
037268|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_057.mp3|||It could take three days.|
037269|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_058.mp3|||Hopefully, it will be built by next year.|
037270|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_059.mp3|||It was totally my fault.|
037271|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_060.mp3|||Or so everyone believed.|
037272|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_061.mp3|||It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.|
037273|en-334|en|mp3-48k/p334_062.mp3|||Perhaps we should do the same.|

037638|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
037639|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
037640|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
037641|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
037642|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
037643|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
037644|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
037645|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
037646|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
037647|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
037648|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
037649|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
037650|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
037651|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
037652|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
037653|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
037654|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
037655|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
037656|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
037657|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

037664|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_031.mp3|||It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.|

037672|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_039.mp3|||He will emerge as a world leader.|

037674|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_041.mp3|||I only half believed it.|
037675|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_042.mp3|||It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.|
037676|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_043.mp3|||All the oil companies are talking together.|
037677|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_044.mp3|||The failings are serious.|
037678|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_045.mp3|||The prognosis is excellent.|
037679|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_046.mp3|||Rangers deserved to beat us.|
037680|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_047.mp3|||That, though, is the measure of the man.|
037681|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_048.mp3|||On reflection, it is more than that.|
037682|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_049.mp3|||It is not normal practice.|
037683|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_050.mp3|||But he just carried on anyway.|
037684|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_051.mp3|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
037685|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_052.mp3|||I would not want to be young again.|
037686|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_053.mp3|||Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.|

037694|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_061.mp3|||It's the most beautiful place on earth.|
037695|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_062.mp3|||I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.|
037696|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_063.mp3|||I've learned from my mistakes.|
037697|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_064.mp3|||This must be wrong.|
037698|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_065.mp3|||He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.|
037699|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_066.mp3|||It probably didn't feel anything, she added.|
037700|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_067.mp3|||I go home only once.|

037704|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_071.mp3|||I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.|
037705|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_072.mp3|||Bin Laden was not mentioned.|
037706|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_073.mp3|||Seven people were later detained by police.|

037708|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_075.mp3|||We should do everything at a stroke.|
037709|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_076.mp3|||He had a moustache.|
037710|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_077.mp3|||It's just for me.|
037711|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_078.mp3|||History is usually written by the victors.|
037712|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_079.mp3|||It plans to return to this field.|
037713|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_080.mp3|||He said because people had invited him.|
037714|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_081.mp3|||That would be dangerous.|
037715|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_082.mp3|||Its workforce is to be made redundant.|
037716|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_083.mp3|||We aim to put them out of business.|
037717|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_084.mp3|||They're completely different from each other.|
037718|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_085.mp3|||He was extremely nervous.|
037719|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_086.mp3|||Hopefully, it will pay off for me.|
037720|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_087.mp3|||Correction, knowing him, he might.|
037721|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_088.mp3|||I came up through the ranks.|
037722|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_089.mp3|||We still don't know what's happened.|

037734|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_101.mp3|||I like what has happened!|
037735|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_102.mp3|||This would not be my first choice.|
037736|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_103.mp3|||We knew nothing about it.|
037737|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_104.mp3|||Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.|
037738|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_105.mp3|||Which perhaps is just as well.|
037739|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_106.mp3|||It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.|
037740|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_107.mp3|||They receive a high profile in the media.|
037741|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_108.mp3|||They have got their position, we have got our position.|
037742|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_109.mp3|||There will be plenty to keep them occupied.|
037743|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_110.mp3|||Or was it?|
037744|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_111.mp3|||It is not fair.|
037745|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_112.mp3|||I saw military vehicles in the distance.|
037746|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_113.mp3|||Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.|
037747|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_114.mp3|||The dealer is on notice.|
037748|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_115.mp3|||But it will backfire.|
037749|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_116.mp3|||We kept going right to the final whistle.|
037750|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_117.mp3|||Police were also perplexed.|
037751|en-335|en|mp3-48k/p335_118.mp3|||For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.|

038067|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038068|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038069|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

038073|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038074|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038075|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
038076|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038077|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038078|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038079|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.|
038080|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

038087|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_031.mp3|||It is sending the wrong message to people.|

038097|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_041.mp3|||Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.|
038098|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_042.mp3|||I should say so.|

038341|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_286.mp3|||He had no problem with alcohol.|
038342|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_287.mp3|||I had no experience at all.|
038343|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_288.mp3|||Yet he remains confident enough.|
038344|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_289.mp3|||It has become very confused.|
038345|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_290.mp3|||Fame and money followed.|
038346|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_291.mp3|||It's a national sport.|
038347|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_292.mp3|||I just made it.|
038348|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_293.mp3|||There was no secrecy.|
038349|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_294.mp3|||A wide range of restrictions are in place.|
038350|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_295.mp3|||Even then it might be difficult.|
038351|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_296.mp3|||I can't believe we didn't win that game.|
038352|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_297.mp3|||Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.|
038353|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_299.mp3|||Relief was beyond belief.|
038354|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_300.mp3|||Beyond that would have been outrageous.|
038355|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_301.mp3|||It was complete nonsense.|
038356|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_302.mp3|||I seem to keep this for the majors.|
038357|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_303.mp3|||It is three years.|
038358|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_304.mp3|||They are not always the same person.|
038359|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_305.mp3|||We meet again in Berlin.|
038360|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_306.mp3|||This is a very special moment for me.|
038361|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_307.mp3|||It is a daunting task.|
038362|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_308.mp3|||Well, it did last time, he was reminded.|
038363|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_309.mp3|||We have chosen for the patients.|
038364|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_310.mp3|||That was me today.|
038365|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_311.mp3|||That is when we are really effective.|
038366|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_312.mp3|||They just would not have run away.|
038367|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_313.mp3|||But this isn't a play about The Troubles.|
038368|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_314.mp3|||This idea has been around for four years.|
038369|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_315.mp3|||But he made a mistake in picking it.|
038370|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_316.mp3|||This is an appealing record.|
038371|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_317.mp3|||They are a perfectly good thing in principle.|
038372|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_318.mp3|||Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.|
038373|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_319.mp3|||This is a problem we have to tackle.|
038374|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_320.mp3|||Yes, it was uplifting.|
038375|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_321.mp3|||Nobody should believe this story.|
038376|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_322.mp3|||No person has been charged.|
038377|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_323.mp3|||One paper was not returned.|
038378|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_324.mp3|||I don't want to do too much.|
038379|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_325.mp3|||We don't have money to get to town.|
038380|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_326.mp3|||We have great support.|
038381|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_327.mp3|||One would not want to go there anyway.|
038382|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_328.mp3|||And it's difficult to argue.|
038383|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_329.mp3|||We'll see what happens.|
038384|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_330.mp3|||That could be in place by next year.|
038385|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_331.mp3|||That's not part of the deal.|
038386|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_332.mp3|||There is a problem.|
038387|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_333.mp3|||He pretended not to care.|
038388|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_334.mp3|||They are very concerned, and you can understand that.|
038389|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_335.mp3|||Not because they want to sing about something.|
038390|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_336.mp3|||Was it too obvious?|
038391|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_337.mp3|||Wouldn't it be nice?|
038392|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_338.mp3|||I was in tears in the street.|
038393|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_339.mp3|||Eriksson, though, was having none of it.|
038394|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_340.mp3|||It is a terrible thing to have happened.|
038395|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_343.mp3|||The work was suspended following the kidnap.|
038396|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_344.mp3|||Fifteen minutes later, they were found.|
038397|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_345.mp3|||That is why we are here.|
038398|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_346.mp3|||He wouldn't do it.|
038399|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_347.mp3|||She becomes a mother.|
038400|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_348.mp3|||He is very much respected within the group.|
038401|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_349.mp3|||People want to learn.|
038402|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_350.mp3|||Bomber was not amused.|
038403|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_351.mp3|||I am not a happy man.|
038404|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_352.mp3|||But it was fun.|
038405|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_353.mp3|||Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.|
038406|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_354.mp3|||No decisions have been made in this respect.|
038407|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_355.mp3|||It's been such a waste of money.|
038408|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_356.mp3|||Not so, it transpires.|
038409|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_357.mp3|||Things don't look too good at the moment.|
038410|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_358.mp3|||Inside, there is a kind of madness.|
038411|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_359.mp3|||I'd like to run.|
038412|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_360.mp3|||Its future is no longer in question.|
038413|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_361.mp3|||But this relative success has not been easy.|
038414|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_362.mp3|||I am a player.|
038415|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_363.mp3|||I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.|
038416|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_364.mp3|||He was not alone.|
038417|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_365.mp3|||There was too much at stake.|
038418|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_366.mp3|||Who wouldn't do it?|
038419|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_368.mp3|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
038420|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_369.mp3|||Eriksson would have approved.|
038421|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_370.mp3|||We are all in the frontline.|
038422|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_371.mp3|||It looked like a war zone.|
038423|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_372.mp3|||His behaviour today has been disgusting.|
038424|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_373.mp3|||Further expansion is possible.|
038425|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_374.mp3|||Tyson said he had made a mistake.|
038426|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_375.mp3|||I'm interested in all kinds of history.|
038427|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_376.mp3|||At this point we can only speculate.|
038428|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_377.mp3|||We know we have the quality.|
038429|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_378.mp3|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|
038430|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_379.mp3|||It may be the first of many.|
038431|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_380.mp3|||It runs in cycles.|
038432|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_381.mp3|||It is already making a difference.|
038433|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_382.mp3|||I spoke to him yesterday.|
038434|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_383.mp3|||We are looking very hard at ourselves.|
038435|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_384.mp3|||This is the stuff of live music.|
038436|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_385.mp3|||We were beaten by the better team today.|
038437|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_386.mp3|||Taxes may need to rise.|
038438|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_387.mp3|||It's unusual to say the least.|
038439|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_388.mp3|||I was quietly confident about getting the win.|
038440|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_389.mp3|||I am not going to sit back.|
038441|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_390.mp3|||But this is even worse.|
038442|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_391.mp3|||It left me with a sadness.|
038443|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_392.mp3|||I was living with my mum.|
038444|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_393.mp3|||The truth is he probably doesn't.|
038445|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_394.mp3|||There were few surprises.|
038446|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_395.mp3|||He is a one-off.|
038447|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_396.mp3|||And then he laughs.|
038448|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_397.mp3|||She is having an affair with his partner.|
038449|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_398.mp3|||He put a lot of effort into it.|
038450|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_399.mp3|||The pressure is enormous.|
038451|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_400.mp3|||I am not that sadistic.|
038452|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_401.mp3|||Are you all right?|
038453|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_402.mp3|||We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.|
038454|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_403.mp3|||I'm certainly thinking about retirement.|
038455|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_404.mp3|||But we say Yes - and we are the people.|
038456|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_405.mp3|||Is it any good?|
038457|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_406.mp3|||The investment programme will deliver these improvements.|
038458|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_407.mp3|||It would be that absurd.|
038459|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_408.mp3|||As if he would.|
038460|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_409.mp3|||I just carry on with my work.|
038461|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_410.mp3|||She made no further comment.|
038462|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_411.mp3|||His attacker has been a Rangers fan.|
038463|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_412.mp3|||He wants the festival to make a difference.|
038464|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_413.mp3|||He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.|
038465|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_415.mp3|||The auction has seven days to run.|
038466|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_416.mp3|||It is easy to be wise in hindsight.|
038467|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_417.mp3|||They want to prove a point.|
038468|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_418.mp3|||It is my decision and my decision alone.|
038469|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_419.mp3|||Would he ever go back to the beginning?|
038470|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_420.mp3|||What is going on?|
038471|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_421.mp3|||Let that be their memorial.|
038472|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_422.mp3|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
038473|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_423.mp3|||Tonight is very special.|
038474|en-336|en|mp3-48k/p336_424.mp3|||This is a matter of life and death.|
038475|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
038476|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
038477|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.|
038478|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
038479|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
038480|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
038481|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038482|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038483|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038484|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038485|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038486|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038487|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038488|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038489|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038490|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038491|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
038492|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038493|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
038494|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038495|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038496|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038497|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
038498|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038499|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_025.mp3|||They missed the boat and everyone suffers.|

038506|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_032.mp3|||Like his acting, it was an accident.|

038508|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_034.mp3|||I want somebody with something to prove.|
038509|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_035.mp3|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
038510|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_036.mp3|||There was a ban on reporting the trial.|
038511|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_037.mp3|||I don't think the action was a mistake.|
038512|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_038.mp3|||You go in there and do it.|
038513|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_039.mp3|||We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.|
038514|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_040.mp3|||What will happen to them today?|
038515|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_041.mp3|||I didn't expect to get one.|
038516|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_042.mp3|||It was electric, amazing.|
038517|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_043.mp3|||I said to him.|
038518|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_044.mp3|||Labour has been found out on public spending.|
038519|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_045.mp3|||he told a producer.|
038520|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_046.mp3|||That is not the place for her.|
038521|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_047.mp3|||The jury is still out on this one.|
038522|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_048.mp3|||We have to work together.|
038523|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_049.mp3|||I don't think that he won't be released.|
038524|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_050.mp3|||It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.|
038525|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_051.mp3|||It means it is difficult.|
038526|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_052.mp3|||But they were true stories.|
038527|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_053.mp3|||I needed to get away.|
038528|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_054.mp3|||I will make that point tonight.|
038529|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_055.mp3|||Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.|
038530|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_056.mp3|||There are two things we have to do.|
038531|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_057.mp3|||Are they going to work together again?|
038532|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_058.mp3|||We need to do that every week.|
038533|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_059.mp3|||It gives us something to work on.|
038534|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_060.mp3|||But what did it matter?|
038535|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_061.mp3|||A government is a government is a government.|
038536|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_062.mp3|||Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.|
038537|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_063.mp3|||I am not retaining him.|
038538|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_064.mp3|||The police are not the target.|
038539|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_065.mp3|||It has affected it, obviously.|
038540|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_066.mp3|||But that title is a mistake.|
038541|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_067.mp3|||And he's not a bigot.|
038542|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_068.mp3|||But summer is spent.|
038543|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_069.mp3|||Services are being expanded, too.|
038544|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_070.mp3|||It has only been rumours.|
038545|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_071.mp3|||It is extremely fortunate.|
038546|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_072.mp3|||Today is the first step in that process.|
038547|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_073.mp3|||Several others were absent.|
038548|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_074.mp3|||It is surprising to come back this way.|
038549|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_075.mp3|||But there was no time for that.|
038550|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_076.mp3|||A review is under way.|
038551|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_077.mp3|||That should be fun.|
038552|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_078.mp3|||Maybe he will act again.|
038553|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_079.mp3|||What we were doing.|
038554|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_080.mp3|||What is the Barnett formula?|
038555|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_081.mp3|||It all happened so suddenly.|
038556|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_082.mp3|||I won't let that happen.|
038557|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_083.mp3|||Or have they?|
038558|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_084.mp3|||There is no change in the strategy.|
038559|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_085.mp3|||I had a fortunate war.|
038560|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_086.mp3|||It will probably be my last, too.|
038561|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_087.mp3|||I am not completely insane.|
038562|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_088.mp3|||We spoke about a few people.|
038563|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_089.mp3|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
038564|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_090.mp3|||In fact, he took it very well.|
038565|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_091.mp3|||I decided to take my time.|
038566|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_092.mp3|||Quite a lot of people know that, actually.|
038567|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_093.mp3|||We did it in one take.|
038568|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_094.mp3|||He doesn't even know who he is.|
038569|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_095.mp3|||It is hard to understand.|
038570|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_096.mp3|||What will it be?|
038571|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_097.mp3|||The search is due to be completed today.|
038572|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_098.mp3|||This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.|
038573|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_099.mp3|||What you sow, you have to reap.|
038574|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_100.mp3|||He is a one-off.|
038575|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_101.mp3|||Six men will take the decision.|
038576|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_102.mp3|||To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.|
038577|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_103.mp3|||We should not be surprised at that.|
038578|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_104.mp3|||It was a disaster.|
038579|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_105.mp3|||We have been so lucky.|
038580|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_107.mp3|||It was a bit of a tightrope.|
038581|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_108.mp3|||I don't know what we're doing wrong.|
038582|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_109.mp3|||It was all over now.|
038583|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_110.mp3|||But it was only a matter of time.|
038584|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_111.mp3|||I always liked to get a laugh.|
038585|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_112.mp3|||I still hope to go.|
038586|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_113.mp3|||Sometimes they come off.|
038587|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_114.mp3|||We're not that bad.|
038588|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_115.mp3|||Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.|
038589|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_116.mp3|||I feel strongly about it.|
038590|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_117.mp3|||There are exciting days ahead.|
038591|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_118.mp3|||We have to put this behind us.|
038592|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_119.mp3|||I thought it was quite good.|
038593|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_120.mp3|||This is a disaster averted for Scotland.|
038594|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_121.mp3|||We're very, very happy.|
038595|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_122.mp3|||There could be a possible connection.|
038596|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_123.mp3|||But there was everything!|
038597|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_124.mp3|||We are doing very well as we are.|
038598|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_125.mp3|||The Scots are great.|
038599|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_126.mp3|||That imbalance was evident in their play.|
038600|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_127.mp3|||However, the drama was not over.|
038601|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_128.mp3|||But it was not just the land.|
038602|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_129.mp3|||I don't think the referees are against us.|
038603|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_130.mp3|||It is too much for me.|
038604|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_131.mp3|||It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.|
038605|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_132.mp3|||We are still waiting.|
038606|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_133.mp3|||It happened again yesterday.|
038607|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_134.mp3|||He will be a major challenger next year.|
038608|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_135.mp3|||That question was never asked.|
038609|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_136.mp3|||I am not inclined to believe it.|
038610|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_137.mp3|||It was on fire.|
038611|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_138.mp3|||I have fallen in love with the Highlands.|
038612|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_139.mp3|||How can they tell?|
038613|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_140.mp3|||My ambition is to make the cut.|
038614|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_141.mp3|||It will be for the committee to decide.|
038615|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_142.mp3|||Their conditions are described as serious but stable.|
038616|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_143.mp3|||Rangers must be winners, it says.|
038617|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_144.mp3|||He was part of the family.|
038618|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_145.mp3|||I certainly think it should be there.|
038619|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_146.mp3|||But it does not matter.|
038620|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_147.mp3|||Hopefully we can put in a performance.|
038621|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_148.mp3|||Sadly, he has a point.|
038622|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_149.mp3|||It was so sad.|
038623|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_150.mp3|||Mind you, all was not lost.|
038624|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_151.mp3|||We were extremely lucky.|
038625|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_152.mp3|||It was an amazing time.|
038626|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_153.mp3|||In fact, the reasons are simple.|
038627|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_154.mp3|||The hearing is expected to continue today.|
038628|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_155.mp3|||It is just a matter of time.|
038629|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_156.mp3|||This news is really depressing.|
038630|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_157.mp3|||I'm not fit for anything else.|
038631|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_158.mp3|||The day may come, but not for a while.|
038632|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_159.mp3|||The enemy was time.|
038633|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_160.mp3|||He would have done the same to me.|
038634|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_161.mp3|||What were they told?|
038635|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_162.mp3|||More cases are expected.|
038636|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_163.mp3|||I believe the gap is nearly there.|
038637|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_164.mp3|||It would be very dangerous.|
038638|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_165.mp3|||How can they say that?|
038639|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_166.mp3|||My condition is not bad.|
038640|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_167.mp3|||Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.|
038641|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_168.mp3|||I would like to make an impact, of course.|
038642|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_169.mp3|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
038643|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_170.mp3|||The goal is clear.|
038644|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_171.mp3|||Just think about the lines.|
038645|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_172.mp3|||It all depends on the wind.|
038646|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_173.mp3|||I was very influenced by him.|
038647|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_174.mp3|||I'm so worried about the roads.|
038648|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_175.mp3|||This was much worse.|
038649|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_176.mp3|||This was certainly not about money.|
038650|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_177.mp3|||It is simple, but profound.|
038651|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_178.mp3|||The funding is now there.|
038652|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_179.mp3|||He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
038653|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_180.mp3|||A film is different from a book.|
038654|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_181.mp3|||Within three days he was dead.|
038655|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_182.mp3|||You'll find out on Saturday.|
038656|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_183.mp3|||Did they give any good advice?|
038657|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_184.mp3|||We know that from recent experience.|
038658|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_185.mp3|||From day one, we were a family.|
038659|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_186.mp3|||It separates the men from the boys.|
038660|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_187.mp3|||This could be wonderful.|
038661|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_188.mp3|||He loved it, and so did they.|
038662|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_189.mp3|||The other was a football match.|
038663|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_190.mp3|||They have the players to do it.|
038664|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_191.mp3|||Which is worse?|
038665|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_192.mp3|||He has made a step forward.|
038666|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_193.mp3|||That was very important.|
038667|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_194.mp3|||This will have to change.|
038668|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_195.mp3|||First, the programme was unbalanced.|
038669|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_196.mp3|||It was a very strong metaphor.|
038670|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_197.mp3|||We are going to have a party.|
038671|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_198.mp3|||I have no problem with that.|
038672|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_199.mp3|||The Parliament will make its own decisions.|
038673|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_200.mp3|||I'm very happy that it exploded.|
038674|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_201.mp3|||We're all paying for it.|
038675|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_202.mp3|||Lester was like that.|
038676|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_203.mp3|||Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.|
038677|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_204.mp3|||That's a matter for them.|
038678|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_205.mp3|||We were never told it was already decided.|
038679|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_206.mp3|||It is part of our heritage.|
038680|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_207.mp3|||It is not a road of life.|
038681|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_208.mp3|||It is not as simple as that.|
038682|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_209.mp3|||Everything in the symphony is there.|
038683|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_210.mp3|||Find them somebody they deserve.|
038684|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_211.mp3|||It's a big challenge for the audience.|
038685|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_212.mp3|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
038686|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_213.mp3|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
038687|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_214.mp3|||We're not getting involved.|
038688|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_215.mp3|||The lottery has helped.|
038689|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_216.mp3|||They know the language.|
038690|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_217.mp3|||The acting left a lot to be desired.|
038691|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_218.mp3|||We shall be victorious.|
038692|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_219.mp3|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
038693|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_220.mp3|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
038694|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_221.mp3|||You cannot do that in a lobby.|
038695|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_222.mp3|||We will all suffer as a result.|
038696|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_223.mp3|||Without doubt, they can win the title.|
038697|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_224.mp3|||What's it about?|
038698|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_225.mp3|||We are looking to the future.|
038699|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_226.mp3|||The signs are positive.|
038700|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_227.mp3|||I called it right.|
038701|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_228.mp3|||I see it as my job.|
038702|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_229.mp3|||I have always believed in myself.|
038703|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_230.mp3|||It has to be put in context.|
038704|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_231.mp3|||I think we can get there.|
038705|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_232.mp3|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
038706|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_233.mp3|||No, they have played well.|
038707|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_234.mp3|||The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|
038708|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_235.mp3|||The answer is obviously no.|
038709|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_236.mp3|||I'll take it as it comes.|
038710|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_237.mp3|||I think we're the better side.|
038711|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_238.mp3|||We act because we must.|
038712|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_239.mp3|||There are two mysteries.|
038713|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_240.mp3|||The teacher would have approved.|
038714|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_241.mp3|||Are you going to win?|
038715|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_242.mp3|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
038716|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_243.mp3|||I could have been killed on that day.|
038717|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_244.mp3|||They have to come up with a solution.|
038718|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_245.mp3|||It is very enjoyable.|
038719|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_246.mp3|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
038720|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_247.mp3|||Did it work?|
038721|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_248.mp3|||But that is for another day.|
038722|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_249.mp3|||There is a great carry over value.|
038723|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_250.mp3|||It was not like that at all.|
038724|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_251.mp3|||Police are appealing for witnesses.|
038725|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_252.mp3|||I was very surprised.|
038726|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_253.mp3|||We all knew they could do it.|
038727|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_254.mp3|||It's about taking risks.|
038728|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_255.mp3|||Why is this?|
038729|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_256.mp3|||He is due in Israel tomorrow.|
038730|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_257.mp3|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
038731|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_258.mp3|||There are not too many like him.|
038732|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_259.mp3|||The memory is there.|
038733|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_260.mp3|||It was an amazing experience.|
038734|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_261.mp3|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
038735|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_262.mp3|||He will go on the bench.|
038736|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_263.mp3|||The police are hopeless.|
038737|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_264.mp3|||There are no plans to change this.|
038738|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_265.mp3|||We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|
038739|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_266.mp3|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
038740|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_267.mp3|||That's the important thing.|
038741|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_268.mp3|||Should he resign?|
038742|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_269.mp3|||They have to live with the risk.|
038743|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_270.mp3|||It is, but that's not the point.|
038744|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_271.mp3|||It was my whole life.|
038745|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_272.mp3|||It was a classic.|
038746|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_273.mp3|||This week is a perfect example.|
038747|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_274.mp3|||However, it is going to happen.|
038748|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_275.mp3|||This time it really could happen.|
038749|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_276.mp3|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
038750|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_277.mp3|||That includes the equipment?|
038751|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_278.mp3|||It does nothing for me.|
038752|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_279.mp3|||That has been lost.|
038753|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_280.mp3|||But that's another story.|
038754|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_281.mp3|||I think it has worked.|
038755|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_282.mp3|||No other family members could be contacted.|
038756|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_283.mp3|||There is nothing to be gained from that.|
038757|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_284.mp3|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
038758|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_285.mp3|||But do not rely on it.|
038759|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_286.mp3|||I made a mistake.|
038760|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_287.mp3|||What do you want.|
038761|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_288.mp3|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
038762|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_289.mp3|||I think we could do well in Europe.|
038763|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_290.mp3|||And yet, there has been no great impact.|
038764|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_291.mp3|||Was that not awful?|
038765|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_292.mp3|||Yesterday was a statement of intent.|
038766|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_293.mp3|||I'm not there yet but it is close.|
038767|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_294.mp3|||But it will not work again.|
038768|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_295.mp3|||Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|
038769|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_296.mp3|||I have nothing to say on that.|
038770|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_297.mp3|||The rest is his own.|
038771|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_298.mp3|||I have no worry about that.|
038772|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_299.mp3|||There has been a fair bit in between, too.|
038773|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_300.mp3|||Who was on the panel?|
038774|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_301.mp3|||It turned out to have been three hours.|
038775|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_302.mp3|||That is exactly right.|
038776|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_303.mp3|||That is not good for golf!|
038777|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_304.mp3|||He had planned to sell it.|
038778|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_305.mp3|||We know the goals will come.|
038779|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_306.mp3|||But it did not last.|
038780|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_307.mp3|||They need to look after themselves.|
038781|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_308.mp3|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
038782|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_309.mp3|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
038783|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_310.mp3|||We have nothing to lose.|
038784|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_311.mp3|||The first time it was rejected.|
038785|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_312.mp3|||He did not report it.|
038786|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_313.mp3|||No-one can take it in.|
038787|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_314.mp3|||They were following his orders.|
038788|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_315.mp3|||That is an entirely different discipline.|
038789|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_316.mp3|||It was an insult.|
038790|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_317.mp3|||Yet there is hope.|
038791|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_318.mp3|||Referees in Scotland are very weak.|
038792|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_319.mp3|||It will not be easy for him.|
038793|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_320.mp3|||That was a fairy tale.|
038794|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_321.mp3|||I would love to do that.|
038795|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_322.mp3|||You'll have to wait and see.|
038796|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_323.mp3|||It wasn't the issue.|
038797|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_324.mp3|||The number never came.|
038798|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_325.mp3|||I really have to go now.|
038799|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_326.mp3|||We are going to listen to Britain.|
038800|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_327.mp3|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
038801|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_328.mp3|||Words are not enough.|
038802|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_329.mp3|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
038803|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_330.mp3|||We have expected it.|
038804|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_331.mp3|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
038805|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_332.mp3|||Well, that was the plan.|
038806|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_333.mp3|||The problem is fairly serious.|
038807|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_334.mp3|||No decisions have been taken.|
038808|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_335.mp3|||We won't do that.|
038809|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_336.mp3|||It's the body that counts.|
038810|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_337.mp3|||Sprinters are not fit.|
038811|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_338.mp3|||This has been coming for weeks and weeks.|
038812|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_339.mp3|||It's a double whammy.|
038813|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_340.mp3|||Charges against the pair were found not proven.|
038814|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_341.mp3|||Let's not make that mistake again.|
038815|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_342.mp3|||That's why he is the prime minister.|
038816|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_343.mp3|||Only injury has prevented that happening before.|
038817|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_344.mp3|||They have to be dealt with.|
038818|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_345.mp3|||His manager blamed the referee.|
038819|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_346.mp3|||So what was he really doing?|
038820|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_347.mp3|||I don't want to go anywhere.|
038821|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_348.mp3|||How do we get a bigger stage?|
038822|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_349.mp3|||We're very close to being a good team.|
038823|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_350.mp3|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
038824|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_351.mp3|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
038825|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_352.mp3|||My mind is the most important thing now.|
038826|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_353.mp3|||I had nothing to lose.|
038827|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_354.mp3|||This is a really serious issue.|
038828|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_355.mp3|||I thought to myself.|
038829|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_356.mp3|||Could it be?|
038830|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_357.mp3|||We're talking to the US.|
038831|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_358.mp3|||Thereafter they were again in control.|
038832|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_359.mp3|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
038833|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_360.mp3|||You have to keep the focus alive.|
038834|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_361.mp3|||It could have been a ceilidh.|
038835|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_362.mp3|||I cannot really commit.|
038836|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_363.mp3|||There are many questions to be answered.|
038837|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_364.mp3|||Sadly, so did a couple of errors.|
038838|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_365.mp3|||This is a new beginning.|
038839|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_366.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
038840|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_367.mp3|||They will fight for everything.|
038841|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_368.mp3|||He is doing just that.|
038842|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_369.mp3|||The night is young.|
038843|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_370.mp3|||But there are signs of a revival.|
038844|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_371.mp3|||I thought it was a great game.|
038845|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_372.mp3|||Just get on with it.|
038846|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_373.mp3|||Germany also said it was unimpressed.|
038847|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_374.mp3|||It shows the Government is listening.|
038848|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_375.mp3|||She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|
038849|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_376.mp3|||They want it to work.|
038850|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_377.mp3|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
038851|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_378.mp3|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
038852|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_379.mp3|||It decided to blame the media.|
038853|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_380.mp3|||We have chosen for the patients.|
038854|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_381.mp3|||He was at the outset of his career.|
038855|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_382.mp3|||Our position is quite clear.|
038856|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_383.mp3|||It could now be up to the courts.|
038857|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_384.mp3|||We can make a difference.|
038858|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_385.mp3|||This was not a contest.|
038859|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_386.mp3|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038860|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_387.mp3|||Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|
038861|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_388.mp3|||I cannot describe it.|
038862|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_389.mp3|||It is not designed to kill.|
038863|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_390.mp3|||He has run a hell of a race.|
038864|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_391.mp3|||We'll have to be satisfied with it.|
038865|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_392.mp3|||Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.|
038866|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_393.mp3|||It is good football in Scotland.|
038867|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_394.mp3|||There is no other option.|
038868|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_395.mp3|||You can feel the tension in the air.|
038869|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_396.mp3|||It is a technique.|
038870|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_397.mp3|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
038871|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_398.mp3|||My body is exhausted.|
038872|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_399.mp3|||It is about more than Scotland.|
038873|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_400.mp3|||It's not just going to be busy.|
038874|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_401.mp3|||She was on the edge of breaking point.|
038875|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_402.mp3|||The first appeared to be successful.|
038876|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_403.mp3|||She was so supportive.|
038877|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_404.mp3|||I'm delighted with our performance.|
038878|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_405.mp3|||We await a decision.|
038879|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_406.mp3|||It's a matter of balance.|
038880|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_407.mp3|||It is an investment in our product.|
038881|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_408.mp3|||Everyone can have their opinion.|
038882|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_409.mp3|||What would you ask?|
038883|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_410.mp3|||We have got to deal with it.|
038884|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_411.mp3|||Where do we spend it?|
038885|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_412.mp3|||I don't know how she does it.|
038886|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_413.mp3|||I saw it later in the news.|
038887|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_414.mp3|||Now we must look to the future.|
038888|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_415.mp3|||I didn't play badly.|
038889|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_416.mp3|||We haven't come out of this very well.|
038890|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_417.mp3|||They are looking for partners.|
038891|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_418.mp3|||I thought they could have made the gesture.|
038892|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_419.mp3|||We should have been rewarded for producing.|
038893|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_420.mp3|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
038894|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_421.mp3|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
038895|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_422.mp3|||There is no shortage of questions.|
038896|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_423.mp3|||Couldn't see the point.|
038897|en-339|en|mp3-48k/p339_424.mp3|||Which, in effect, it is.|
038898|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
038899|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
038900|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
038901|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
038902|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
038903|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
038904|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038905|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038906|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038907|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038908|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038909|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038910|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038911|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
038912|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
038913|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
038914|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.|
038915|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038916|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
038917|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038918|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038919|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038920|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
038921|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_025.mp3|||It would be nice.|
038922|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_026.mp3|||We are not prepared to do that.|
038923|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_027.mp3|||We've just decided to do something about it.|
038924|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_028.mp3|||It's a horrific incident.|
038925|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_029.mp3|||But it's not just about that.|
038926|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_030.mp3|||We've not won anything yet.|
038927|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_031.mp3|||He was very close.|
038928|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_032.mp3|||But someone has to take them.|
038929|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_033.mp3|||We don't find any danger from them.|
038930|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_034.mp3|||Do you think they would do any better?|
038931|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_035.mp3|||They were appalling, disgraceful.|
038932|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_036.mp3|||Who was that?|
038933|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_037.mp3|||There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!|
038934|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_038.mp3|||This is my personal assessment.|
038935|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_039.mp3|||It is a recipe for success.|
038936|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_040.mp3|||You've got to have everything inside with you.|
038937|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_041.mp3|||We didn't deserve to win.|
038938|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_042.mp3|||This is great news.|
038939|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_043.mp3|||We can hardly talk about it.|
038940|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_044.mp3|||That was a month ago.|
038941|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_045.mp3|||I have lost all confidence.|
038942|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_046.mp3|||It would be another reason to live.|
038943|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_047.mp3|||I felt under a lot of pressure.|
038944|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_048.mp3|||None of the pieces was commissioned.|
038945|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_049.mp3|||It is somewhere to be.|
038946|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_050.mp3|||But it was no problem.|
038947|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_051.mp3|||This has been a difficult time for me.|
038948|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_052.mp3|||These people are not big names.|
038949|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_053.mp3|||Don't you believe it.|
038950|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_054.mp3|||I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|
038951|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_055.mp3|||We did something about it.|
038952|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_056.mp3|||Where is the money coming from?|
038953|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_057.mp3|||It needs a rethink.|
038954|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_058.mp3|||Why does it work?|
038955|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_059.mp3|||He would have been wrong.|
038956|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_060.mp3|||He played really, really well.|
038957|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_061.mp3|||He was right of course.|
038958|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_062.mp3|||It's there for people to look at.|
038959|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_063.mp3|||Together, we can make a difference.|
038960|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_064.mp3|||That, however, was the exception.|
038961|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_065.mp3|||This has been a long process.|
038962|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_066.mp3|||It's a lovely, lovely film.|
038963|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_067.mp3|||It's probably just as well.|
038964|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_068.mp3|||It is time for the talking to stop.|
038965|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_069.mp3|||We were very close.|
038966|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_070.mp3|||If only it were so.|
038967|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_071.mp3|||They do not deliver.|
038968|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_072.mp3|||However, that is just for starters.|
038969|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_073.mp3|||This can be extreme.|
038970|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_074.mp3|||I'm sure that they will learn.|
038971|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_075.mp3|||Would she remember the music?|
038972|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_076.mp3|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
038973|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_077.mp3|||Two options are being proposed.|
038974|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_078.mp3|||Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.|
038975|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_079.mp3|||He is now back in Britain.|
038976|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_080.mp3|||There was no commission.|
038977|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_081.mp3|||There was a vacuum.|
038978|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_082.mp3|||It is time to be realistic.|
038979|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_083.mp3|||Everyone in front of me was dead.|
038980|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_084.mp3|||Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.|
038981|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_085.mp3|||It is a potential danger.|
038982|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_086.mp3|||I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.|
038983|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_087.mp3|||But we never wanted to do that here.|
038984|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_088.mp3|||There was no hint of scandal.|
038985|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_089.mp3|||The money will go straight to the headteacher.|
038986|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_090.mp3|||He said, we're delighted by the vote.|
038987|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_091.mp3|||It could be to do with the location.|
038988|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_092.mp3|||This is a terrible tragedy.|
038989|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_093.mp3|||The teenager had been missing for six months.|
038990|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_094.mp3|||I'm delighted to be coming back home.|
038991|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_095.mp3|||He said he never saw it.|
038992|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_096.mp3|||It is a matter of clarity.|
038993|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_097.mp3|||You will never get a conviction.|
038994|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_098.mp3|||He did not have to stop and think.|
038995|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_099.mp3|||We deserved to win it.|
038996|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_100.mp3|||Or did it?|
038997|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_101.mp3|||It's just not funny!|
038998|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_102.mp3|||His own excitement is never difficult to detect.|
038999|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_103.mp3|||He almost admitted as much.|
039000|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_104.mp3|||So what is the problem?|
039001|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_105.mp3|||We believe it to be completely without merit.|
039002|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_106.mp3|||He didn't bother a soul.|
039003|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_107.mp3|||That was my first reaction.|
039004|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_108.mp3|||Fishing is a declining industry.|
039005|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_109.mp3|||Another man said, It was horrible.|
039006|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_110.mp3|||That's the way it goes.|
039007|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_111.mp3|||But we still don't know.|
039008|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_112.mp3|||Are there any he wants to play?|
039009|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_113.mp3|||The film is on a tightrope.|
039010|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_114.mp3|||It was a question of patience.|
039011|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_115.mp3|||I have never been in anything like that.|
039012|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_116.mp3|||I have done ever since it was published.|
039013|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_117.mp3|||We have got to the top.|
039014|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_118.mp3|||In fact, they have the opposite effect.|
039015|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_119.mp3|||And it worked, so we kept it.|
039016|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_120.mp3|||The king is delighted by the honour.|
039017|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_121.mp3|||Johnsen is equally concerned.|
039018|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_122.mp3|||My body is clearly capable.|
039019|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_123.mp3|||Yes, we can beat them.|
039020|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_124.mp3|||She was not hard done by.|
039021|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_125.mp3|||They said they were only young men.|
039022|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_126.mp3|||We are in the end game.|
039023|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_127.mp3|||This is not the case.|
039024|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_128.mp3|||There may be some resistance.|
039025|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_129.mp3|||It is the same old story.|
039026|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_130.mp3|||You need that freedom in society.|
039027|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_131.mp3|||It is a strong case.|
039028|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_132.mp3|||Who do you think will win?|
039029|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_133.mp3|||I certainly would not accept this decision.|
039030|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_134.mp3|||That was one very hard game.|
039031|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_135.mp3|||He said something in his work.|
039032|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_136.mp3|||I recommend a tour.|
039033|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_137.mp3|||This research is extremely promising.|
039034|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_138.mp3|||I was invited to work in Germany.|
039035|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_139.mp3|||Weather conditions were good, he added.|
039036|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_140.mp3|||Don't hold your breath.|
039037|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_141.mp3|||He was shaking like a leaf.|
039038|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_142.mp3|||I have a moral dilemma.|
039039|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_143.mp3|||It looks like a hit.|
039040|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_144.mp3|||How did he know?|
039041|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_145.mp3|||He will have to live with his words.|
039042|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_146.mp3|||Openness is always the best way.|
039043|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_147.mp3|||It added to the spectacle.|
039044|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_148.mp3|||They are working very well.|
039045|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_149.mp3|||And he listens to his artists as well.|
039046|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_150.mp3|||He is advised that he has done so.|
039047|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_151.mp3|||Annika is very, very fit.|
039048|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_152.mp3|||This is not quite right.|
039049|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_153.mp3|||It really is tremendous.|
039050|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_154.mp3|||I've never regretted my decision.|
039051|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_155.mp3|||This is a recipe for disaster.|
039052|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_156.mp3|||The wind was coming from all directions.|
039053|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_157.mp3|||So we started building a home.|
039054|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_158.mp3|||He was as good as his word.|
039055|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_159.mp3|||It will not happen overnight.|
039056|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_160.mp3|||Surely it can't get any worse.|
039057|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_161.mp3|||He has to learn.|
039058|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_162.mp3|||He, too, will return.|
039059|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_163.mp3|||What then is wrong?|
039060|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_164.mp3|||My brother is not like that.|
039061|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_165.mp3|||He was very fit.|
039062|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_166.mp3|||It was very exciting.|
039063|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_167.mp3|||It is clear that change is required.|
039064|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_168.mp3|||They did a very good job.|
039065|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_169.mp3|||It has been a waste of time.|
039066|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_170.mp3|||As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.|
039067|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_171.mp3|||He had no previous convictions.|
039068|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_172.mp3|||It is no more than a shell.|
039069|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_173.mp3|||And did they have sex?|
039070|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_174.mp3|||But he was a really nice man.|
039071|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_175.mp3|||It was very close.|
039072|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_176.mp3|||It should be scrapped.|
039073|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_177.mp3|||It gives us hope.|
039074|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_178.mp3|||We can't determine that clearly.|
039075|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_179.mp3|||They are just trying to cover up.|
039076|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_180.mp3|||Are you the man from The Herald?|
039077|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_181.mp3|||And that's it?|
039078|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_182.mp3|||I came here this week to work.|
039079|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_183.mp3|||We are really good friends.|
039080|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_184.mp3|||But that is not an issue for now.|
039081|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_185.mp3|||Of course the ending was fantastic.|
039082|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_186.mp3|||I want to be frank.|
039083|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_187.mp3|||This was an option from the beginning.|
039084|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_188.mp3|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
039085|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_189.mp3|||Yet it seemed to work.|
039086|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_190.mp3|||I think it was just a tragic accident.|
039087|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_191.mp3|||We haven't been able to go and see.|
039088|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_192.mp3|||It works, as well.|
039089|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_193.mp3|||I can't say anything.|
039090|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_194.mp3|||I would be interested in another attempt.|
039091|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_195.mp3|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
039092|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_196.mp3|||There is no other way.|
039093|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_197.mp3|||This was all well and good.|
039094|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_198.mp3|||This is a disaster for us.|
039095|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_199.mp3|||What does that mean?|
039096|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_200.mp3|||This is your life.|
039097|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_201.mp3|||He has seen the past.|
039098|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_202.mp3|||He can be beaten.|
039099|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_203.mp3|||He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.|
039100|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_204.mp3|||Why does he do it?|
039101|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_205.mp3|||That's my daughter acting.|
039102|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_206.mp3|||They are very clever and very dangerous.|
039103|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_207.mp3|||It wouldn't matter if he had.|
039104|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_208.mp3|||We lost out a little bit.|
039105|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_209.mp3|||Hollywood comedy is having a good week.|
039106|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_210.mp3|||I had just taken it off.|
039107|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_211.mp3|||The family baton is handed on.|
039108|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_212.mp3|||We have to put pressure on Rangers.|
039109|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_213.mp3|||It was properly reported to us.|
039110|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_214.mp3|||He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.|
039111|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_215.mp3|||The seller was not revealed.|
039112|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_216.mp3|||Everything happened so quickly.|
039113|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_217.mp3|||How can this be?|
039114|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_218.mp3|||I am feeling a bit better.|
039115|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_219.mp3|||Everyone here is heartbroken.|
039116|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_220.mp3|||Not so, it seems.|
039117|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_221.mp3|||He was also a great man.|
039118|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_222.mp3|||We have no further comment to make.|
039119|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_223.mp3|||This produces exactly the opposite effect.|
039120|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_224.mp3|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
039121|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_225.mp3|||You have to keep it on the fairways.|
039122|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_226.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
039123|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_227.mp3|||So there, we won.|
039124|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_228.mp3|||I don't like to fail.|
039125|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_229.mp3|||I really didn't think he would.|
039126|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_230.mp3|||He may have a long wait.|
039127|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_231.mp3|||They have already done that.|
039128|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_232.mp3|||Later, a very different story emerged.|
039129|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_233.mp3|||So it should be.|
039130|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_234.mp3|||They didn't find any substance.|
039131|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_235.mp3|||It's hard to say.|
039132|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_236.mp3|||Her heart was not in it.|
039133|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_237.mp3|||After all, he is the King of Scotland.|
039134|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_238.mp3|||Is there any prospect of this happening?|
039135|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_239.mp3|||They are now collapsing.|
039136|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_240.mp3|||He had been surprised by the local reaction.|
039137|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_241.mp3|||Government funding is not a problem.|
039138|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_242.mp3|||I'm still an amateur in that sense.|
039139|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_243.mp3|||We just did not want to believe it.|
039140|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_244.mp3|||The medal itself is not that important.|
039141|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_245.mp3|||I should think so, too.|
039142|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_246.mp3|||The time for change is now.|
039143|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_247.mp3|||They deserved to beat us in the replay.|
039144|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_248.mp3|||Can they be serious?|
039145|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_249.mp3|||We've got to get this right.|
039146|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_250.mp3|||The film was great.|
039147|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_251.mp3|||I'm just enjoying every match.|
039148|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_252.mp3|||They set up to win the hole.|
039149|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_253.mp3|||I am not a liar.|
039150|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_254.mp3|||Let's make this clear.|
039151|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_255.mp3|||We also hope to meet the men.|
039152|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_256.mp3|||It was quite simply, delicious.|
039153|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_257.mp3|||I can't believe it happened.|
039154|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_258.mp3|||Thankfully it was cleared up.|
039155|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_259.mp3|||The game will be at a football stadium.|
039156|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_260.mp3|||They were his words.|
039157|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_261.mp3|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
039158|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_262.mp3|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
039159|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_263.mp3|||People were very confused.|
039160|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_264.mp3|||We've had a lot of adjusting to do.|
039161|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_265.mp3|||I am very relieved.|
039162|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_266.mp3|||The people have been really friendly.|
039163|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_267.mp3|||It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|
039164|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_268.mp3|||Aberdeen were difficult to break down.|
039165|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_269.mp3|||That, though, is not true.|
039166|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_270.mp3|||I hope he comes back.|
039167|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_271.mp3|||They made up for it on Saturday.|
039168|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_272.mp3|||That was our mission.|
039169|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_273.mp3|||I am delighted for them.|
039170|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_274.mp3|||The second half was a different affair.|
039171|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_275.mp3|||The scheme has been funded by the Government.|
039172|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_276.mp3|||They might be surprised by the response.|
039173|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_277.mp3|||I've done it all.|
039174|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_278.mp3|||We have worked well with them for years.|
039175|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_279.mp3|||They've had a good start as well.|
039176|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_280.mp3|||The director's a genius.|
039177|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_281.mp3|||One thing is clear.|
039178|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_282.mp3|||We might never see him again.|
039179|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_283.mp3|||Such as it is.|
039180|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_284.mp3|||The car was just there.|
039181|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_285.mp3|||They were very unfair to him.|
039182|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_286.mp3|||I have spoken to my brother.|
039183|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_287.mp3|||And that is very good indeed.|
039184|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_288.mp3|||We could have had no new money.|
039185|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_289.mp3|||It wasn't an easy decision.|
039186|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_290.mp3|||It wasn't really like that at all.|
039187|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_291.mp3|||What will happen to them now?|
039188|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_292.mp3|||It is set in Paris.|
039189|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_293.mp3|||The Dream is as hard as they come.|
039190|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_294.mp3|||We are not collecting.|
039191|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_295.mp3|||It shows the right amount of progress.|
039192|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_296.mp3|||I thought the dancing was over.|
039193|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_297.mp3|||I think they have got it completely right.|
039194|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_298.mp3|||This is excellent news for Glasgow.|
039195|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_299.mp3|||He's already made history.|
039196|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_300.mp3|||Police have appealed for witnesses.|
039197|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_301.mp3|||There is a lot of fear.|
039198|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_302.mp3|||They are not left wing.|
039199|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_303.mp3|||I've heard it all before.|
039200|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_304.mp3|||We are not there yet.|
039201|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_305.mp3|||We will not give up on the truth.|
039202|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_306.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCall.|
039203|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_307.mp3|||Now they had it.|
039204|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_308.mp3|||She died a few days later.|
039205|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_309.mp3|||What is their concern?|
039206|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_310.mp3|||The difference was amazing.|
039207|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_311.mp3|||That is why we are here.|
039208|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_312.mp3|||But it is historic.|
039209|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_313.mp3|||You have to feel for the guy.|
039210|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_314.mp3|||I have still to hear about that.|
039211|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_315.mp3|||I'm going to win the next two.|
039212|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_316.mp3|||You know it was good fun.|
039213|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_317.mp3|||They want that school.|
039214|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_318.mp3|||They have not changed at all.|
039215|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_319.mp3|||One is investment, one is reform.|
039216|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_320.mp3|||The last few weeks have been really bad.|
039217|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_321.mp3|||Structural changes will never be enough.|
039218|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_322.mp3|||I am extremely cautious.|
039219|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_323.mp3|||That was always the danger.|
039220|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_324.mp3|||Will they fall in love?|
039221|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_325.mp3|||There was nothing sinister in that.|
039222|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_326.mp3|||But don't just take my word for it.|
039223|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_327.mp3|||Is that what it's about?|
039224|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_328.mp3|||And the audience is a surprise.|
039225|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_329.mp3|||They worked on it for three hours.|
039226|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_330.mp3|||Let's make him a show.|
039227|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_331.mp3|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
039228|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_332.mp3|||People are using it in their daily lives.|
039229|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_333.mp3|||It seemed so personal.|
039230|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_334.mp3|||Would that be for men and women?|
039231|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_335.mp3|||The government agreed to pay.|
039232|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_336.mp3|||I think we have got the balance right.|
039233|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_337.mp3|||It was a very terrible thing.|
039234|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_338.mp3|||Let's not take too much for granted.|
039235|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_339.mp3|||It has been an extremely long haul.|

039241|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_345.mp3|||When will this change?|
039242|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_346.mp3|||You know the score.|
039243|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_347.mp3|||It was like someone had died.|
039244|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_348.mp3|||I am an innocent man.|

039253|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_357.mp3|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
039254|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_358.mp3|||The time was right.|
039255|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_359.mp3|||It all happened so quickly.|

039277|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_381.mp3|||There was no question of him not impressing.|

039279|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_383.mp3|||I hadn't had that before.|

039281|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_385.mp3|||That is to miss the point.|

039291|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_395.mp3|||It wasn't the second one.|

039293|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_397.mp3|||And rugby fans can help.|

039295|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_399.mp3|||I reported it but nothing was done.|
039296|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_400.mp3|||They were not defeated.|
039297|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_401.mp3|||There was much to be positive about.|
039298|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_402.mp3|||It wants them to go home.|
039299|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_403.mp3|||I had a ball today.|
039300|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_404.mp3|||Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.|

039303|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_407.mp3|||We shall not do that.|
039304|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_408.mp3|||My daughter was really, really innocent.|
039305|en-340|en|mp3-48k/p340_409.mp3|||It will not be easy.|

039323|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
039324|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
039325|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
039326|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
039327|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
039328|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
039329|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
039330|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
039331|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
039332|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039333|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|
039334|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
039335|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
039336|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
039337|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
039338|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
039339|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
039340|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039341|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039342|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
039343|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
039344|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
039345|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_025.mp3|||This guy is never going to give up.|
039346|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_026.mp3|||That's interesting to me.|

039351|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_031.mp3|||I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.|
039352|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_032.mp3|||It has moved on in the last week.|
039353|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_033.mp3|||Everything was up for grabs.|
039354|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_034.mp3|||It's easy to see why.|
039355|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_035.mp3|||I am proud of moments like that.|
039356|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_036.mp3|||That was no surprise to me.|
039357|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_037.mp3|||This has been blown out of all proportion.|
039358|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_038.mp3|||There is no escape.|
039359|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_039.mp3|||It's wonderful to have won.|

039363|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_043.mp3|||Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.|
039364|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_044.mp3|||This is a big advantage.|
039365|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_045.mp3|||Her daughter is getting married.|
039366|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_046.mp3|||Moray Council could not be contacted last night.|

039369|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_049.mp3|||Today is not about contracts.|
039370|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_050.mp3|||That says something for his strength of character.|
039371|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_051.mp3|||We are going for it.|
039372|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_052.mp3|||You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.|
039373|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_053.mp3|||It's to do with play.|
039374|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_054.mp3|||However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|
039375|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_055.mp3|||I've just got to do this.|
039376|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_056.mp3|||It's not, of course, a concert hall.|

039384|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_064.mp3|||This is the crossroads.|
039385|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_065.mp3|||He had played well in that central role.|
039386|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_066.mp3|||He is pretty upset.|
039387|en-341|en|mp3-48k/p341_067.mp3|||And who would argue with that?|

039765|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_039.mp3|||It is up to Ann.|
039766|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_040.mp3|||And you know something?|
039767|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_041.mp3|||We were with him the whole time.|
039768|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_042.mp3|||That was the theory, anyway.|
039769|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_043.mp3|||We've all been here before.|
039770|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_044.mp3|||I had troubles with the producers.|
039771|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_045.mp3|||So, it took me back to boarding school.|
039772|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_046.mp3|||He died the following year.|
039773|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_047.mp3|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
039774|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_048.mp3|||He is trying really hard.|
039775|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_049.mp3|||I have no doubt about that.|
039776|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_050.mp3|||It is a beautiful country.|
039777|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_051.mp3|||I expect a rapid response.|
039778|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_052.mp3|||There was still more disquiet in Israel.|
039779|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_053.mp3|||This was never a support group.|
039780|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_054.mp3|||I must take a seat.|
039781|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_055.mp3|||My mother is a widow.|
039782|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_056.mp3|||Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.|
039783|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_057.mp3|||Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.|
039784|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_058.mp3|||The matter will come up again.|
039785|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_059.mp3|||I don't believe in gesture politics.|
039786|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_060.mp3|||The decision is purely down to the clinic.|
039787|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_061.mp3|||He should be a great asset.|
039788|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_062.mp3|||But that's another story for another day.|
039789|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_063.mp3|||One thing is sure.|
039790|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_064.mp3|||He has really done well.|
039791|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_065.mp3|||I'm just delighted to take it.|
039792|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_066.mp3|||This happened on three days inside a week.|
039793|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_067.mp3|||Funding needs to be long term.|
039794|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_068.mp3|||It's funny how it comes and goes.|
039795|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_069.mp3|||It was just awful.|
039796|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_070.mp3|||That is really all.|
039797|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_071.mp3|||We played too deeply.|
039798|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_072.mp3|||We could have got three medals.|
039799|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_073.mp3|||I am ready to go.|
039800|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_074.mp3|||We are still suffering from that.|
039801|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_075.mp3|||The script was funny.|
039802|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_076.mp3|||We are at the crossroads.|
039803|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_077.mp3|||I am about protecting the state pension.|
039804|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_078.mp3|||They were at school together.|
039805|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_079.mp3|||I am looking forward to getting home.|
039806|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_080.mp3|||Painful, but only because it's true.|
039807|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_081.mp3|||Once they go away they won't come back.|
039808|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_082.mp3|||Colonel, About this committee that is coming.|
039809|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_083.mp3|||That was the easy election.|
039810|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_084.mp3|||I didn't understand it.|
039811|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_085.mp3|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|
039812|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_086.mp3|||Both sides have been hit by injury.|
039813|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_087.mp3|||No one was listening.|
039814|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_088.mp3|||I will report in the spring.|
039815|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_089.mp3|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
039816|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_090.mp3|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
039817|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_091.mp3|||It's terrible that this is happening.|
039818|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_092.mp3|||He's got the same story.|
039819|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_093.mp3|||They were going through the motions, but that's about all.|
039820|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_094.mp3|||It is par for the course, of course.|
039821|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_095.mp3|||And so it goes on.|
039822|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_096.mp3|||The winner will be announced next month.|
039823|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_097.mp3|||What was this?|
039824|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_098.mp3|||I am not a fan of books.|
039825|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_099.mp3|||It may well have been.|
039826|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_100.mp3|||Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.|
039827|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_101.mp3|||We can only go up.|
039828|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_102.mp3|||I am not a doctor.|
039829|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_103.mp3|||It is all in the mind.|
039830|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_104.mp3|||And we have beaten them before.|
039831|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_105.mp3|||Many others are subjected to violence by men.|
039832|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_106.mp3|||Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.|
039833|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_107.mp3|||I am not a paedophile.|
039834|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_108.mp3|||I've got to get noticed!|
039835|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_109.mp3|||Not that it was needed.|
039836|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_110.mp3|||It's up to them to decide.|
039837|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_111.mp3|||But we can't have a casino.|
039838|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_112.mp3|||I would love to play in Europe again.|
039839|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_113.mp3|||The odds are that it will.|
039840|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_114.mp3|||After this, they were always in the driving seat.|
039841|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_115.mp3|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
039842|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_116.mp3|||But let's not get ahead of ourselves.|
039843|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_117.mp3|||He also has property interests in the country.|
039844|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_118.mp3|||That is the position the MoD has adopted.|
039845|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_119.mp3|||The hearing was expected to last six weeks.|
039846|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_120.mp3|||I cannot believe this decision.|
039847|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_121.mp3|||This decision is destroying my family.|
039848|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_122.mp3|||Why is that?|
039849|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_123.mp3|||Well, the big day has arrived.|
039850|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_124.mp3|||We reckon we can do very well.|
039851|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_125.mp3|||But it's been kept to a minimum.|
039852|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_126.mp3|||It has been a great day.|
039853|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_127.mp3|||We are not with you.|
039854|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_128.mp3|||Then came the crunch.|
039855|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_129.mp3|||If so, they were wrong.|
039856|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_130.mp3|||It is open season on the Old Firm.|
039857|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_131.mp3|||The answer is maybe.|
039858|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_132.mp3|||The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.|
039859|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_133.mp3|||The referee had a shocking game.|
039860|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_134.mp3|||I haven't been able to do it since.|
039861|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_135.mp3|||It's about doing things.|
039862|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_136.mp3|||For a few years we had good fun.|
039863|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_137.mp3|||All the pressure will be on him.|
039864|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_139.mp3|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
039865|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_140.mp3|||That was a good effort.|
039866|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_141.mp3|||We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|
039867|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_142.mp3|||He must not be removed from office.|
039868|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_143.mp3|||He had finally had enough.|
039869|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_144.mp3|||But not all were so defiant.|
039870|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_145.mp3|||We are not going to get carried away.|
039871|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_146.mp3|||I told that to the police.|
039872|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_147.mp3|||On the other hand, the poster did not help.|
039873|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_148.mp3|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
039874|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_149.mp3|||But when we do it it is great.|
039875|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_150.mp3|||I'm going to win the gold.|
039876|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_151.mp3|||He pleaded for caution.|
039877|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_152.mp3|||It always had to be about the gym.|
039878|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_153.mp3|||Only one got through.|
039879|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_154.mp3|||It's like a garage.|
039880|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_155.mp3|||They've been wonderful to me.|
039881|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_157.mp3|||I can't believe the buzz.|
039882|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_158.mp3|||It is a traffic warden.|
039883|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_159.mp3|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
039884|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_160.mp3|||It had been played at festivals.|
039885|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_161.mp3|||That never came to court as a charge.|
039886|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_162.mp3|||Dancing was her life.|
039887|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_163.mp3|||The latter way is my way.|
039888|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_164.mp3|||Staff have been informed.|
039889|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_165.mp3|||It is one of those things.|
039890|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_166.mp3|||His is a success story by any standard.|
039891|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_167.mp3|||Are his works inside out?|
039892|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_168.mp3|||He can do no wrong.|
039893|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_169.mp3|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|
039894|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_170.mp3|||Do they have to create seven majors?|
039895|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_171.mp3|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
039896|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_172.mp3|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
039897|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_173.mp3|||Is something which we just don't do.|
039898|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_174.mp3|||That began as an accident.|
039899|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_175.mp3|||It is, though the law is not clear cut.|
039900|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_176.mp3|||He will want to utilise the midfield.|
039901|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_177.mp3|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
039902|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_178.mp3|||I am looking forward to this film.|
039903|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_179.mp3|||This has been very frustrating for him.|
039904|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_180.mp3|||The talking cannot go on too long.|
039905|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_181.mp3|||I've got a young family.|
039906|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_182.mp3|||I hope that that will be forthcoming.|
039907|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_183.mp3|||But experience is a wonderful thing.|
039908|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_184.mp3|||Footage has been passed on to the police.|
039909|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_185.mp3|||Of course, there was still much to be done.|
039910|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_186.mp3|||If he does, he has a real chance of gold.|
039911|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_187.mp3|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
039912|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_188.mp3|||It was good today.|
039913|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_189.mp3|||She really suffered for her art.|
039914|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_190.mp3|||I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|
039915|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_191.mp3|||That tells you something.|
039916|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_192.mp3|||It has been a magical moment.|
039917|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_193.mp3|||Is that not uncanny?|
039918|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_194.mp3|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
039919|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_195.mp3|||The hotel was huge.|
039920|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_196.mp3|||These days are over.|
039921|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_197.mp3|||A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.|
039922|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_198.mp3|||Well, you can have a tree.|
039923|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_199.mp3|||Or so it is hoped.|
039924|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_201.mp3|||He said to give a local injection.|
039925|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_202.mp3|||This is an internal matter.|
039926|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_203.mp3|||Entries from the event are still being accepted.|
039927|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_204.mp3|||They made such decisions in London.|
039928|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_205.mp3|||That has proved to be a lasting lesson.|
039929|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_206.mp3|||I was influenced by all of these things.|
039930|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_207.mp3|||He is helping police with their inquiries.|
039931|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_208.mp3|||The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|
039932|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_209.mp3|||Children also died in Britain.|
039933|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_210.mp3|||I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.|
039934|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_211.mp3|||We want to get there.|
039935|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_213.mp3|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
039936|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_214.mp3|||He said he would appeal the sentences.|
039937|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_215.mp3|||The hearing was fair.|
039938|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_216.mp3|||He has the edge.|
039939|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_217.mp3|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
039940|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_218.mp3|||If he leaves, the band is finished.|
039941|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_219.mp3|||He saw it all as a big game.|
039942|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_220.mp3|||I didn't actually work up a speech.|
039943|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_221.mp3|||Here we have not had one hour.|
039944|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_222.mp3|||That was never their agenda.|
039945|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_223.mp3|||But he kept on repeating it.|
039946|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_224.mp3|||She is currently in foster care.|
039947|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_225.mp3|||That's the only thing that matters.|
039948|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_226.mp3|||They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
039949|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_227.mp3|||The service will only survive with change.|
039950|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_228.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
039951|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_229.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
039952|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_230.mp3|||You have a very persuasive president.|
039953|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_231.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
039954|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_232.mp3|||She has not returned to work.|
039955|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_233.mp3|||We could learn a lot from them.|
039956|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_234.mp3|||He is the saviour of South Africa.|
039957|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_235.mp3|||The players are obviously keen to do well.|
039958|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_236.mp3|||Men should avoid it like the plague.|
039959|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_237.mp3|||It's really good fun.|
039960|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_238.mp3|||Our positions remains unchanged.|
039961|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_239.mp3|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
039962|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_240.mp3|||Is a drug dealer?|
039963|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_241.mp3|||We did not complete the process.|
039964|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_242.mp3|||Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.|
039965|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_243.mp3|||Where are you taking her?|
039966|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_244.mp3|||The weather forecast isn't good.|
039967|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_245.mp3|||They have not been named.|
039968|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_246.mp3|||He died later in hospital.|
039969|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_247.mp3|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
039970|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_248.mp3|||He had a great game.|
039971|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_249.mp3|||It's still got that at its heart.|
039972|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_250.mp3|||Actually, nothing much will change.|
039973|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_251.mp3|||We will turn the corner.|
039974|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_252.mp3|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
039975|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_253.mp3|||There were too many mistakes.|
039976|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_254.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
039977|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_255.mp3|||However, my position remains the same.|
039978|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_256.mp3|||It was totally out of the blue.|
039979|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_257.mp3|||Horses are not affected.|
039980|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_258.mp3|||It went on forever.|
039981|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_259.mp3|||I'm not going to change from it.|
039982|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_260.mp3|||And they are different.|
039983|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_261.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|
039984|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_262.mp3|||He knows the course.|
039985|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_263.mp3|||That idea is rubbish.|
039986|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_264.mp3|||There is no room for error.|
039987|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_265.mp3|||Worry can have that effect on some citizens.|
039988|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_266.mp3|||As, indeed, they would be.|
039989|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_267.mp3|||If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.|
039990|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_268.mp3|||We are all suffering.|
039991|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_269.mp3|||People should make their own decisions.|
039992|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_270.mp3|||That is a question for the next manager.|
039993|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_271.mp3|||I knew people on that committee.|
039994|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_273.mp3|||Again, we were lucky.|
039995|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_274.mp3|||There was no argument.|
039996|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_275.mp3|||He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.|
039997|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_276.mp3|||She is a valuable member of Government.|
039998|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_277.mp3|||I just need a bit of luck.|
039999|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_278.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
040000|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_279.mp3|||We are talking about one family.|
040001|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_280.mp3|||He is not a pathetic figure.|
040002|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_281.mp3|||The error appeared in a warrant.|
040003|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_282.mp3|||Everything is so new.|
040004|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_283.mp3|||It may take time to get it back.|
040005|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_284.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
040006|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_285.mp3|||I can feel the sound inside.|
040007|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_286.mp3|||The answer is yes.|
040008|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_287.mp3|||I believe in debate and dialogue.|
040009|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_288.mp3|||The second aspect was the fear of failure.|
040010|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_289.mp3|||That is a personal matter.|
040011|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_290.mp3|||The princess has had other health problems.|
040012|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_291.mp3|||I would rather say nothing at the moment.|
040013|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_292.mp3|||The clarity is vital.|
040014|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_293.mp3|||I could not sit in the stands.|
040015|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_294.mp3|||He had a decision to make.|
040016|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_295.mp3|||Strikers like to go to the ground.|
040017|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_296.mp3|||It makes no influence on the public.|
040018|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_297.mp3|||It's ahead of Labour.|
040019|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_298.mp3|||It's the whole package.|
040020|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_299.mp3|||I was totally wrong.|
040021|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_300.mp3|||This has got to stop.|
040022|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_301.mp3|||It was a matter of chance.|
040023|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_302.mp3|||There is no point of looking any further.|
040024|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_303.mp3|||It is a real concern.|
040025|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_304.mp3|||Is it the flight?|
040026|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_306.mp3|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
040027|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_307.mp3|||Scotland doesn't even have a target.|
040028|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_308.mp3|||They really shouldn't have put it out.|
040029|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_309.mp3|||A compromise is essential.|
040030|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_310.mp3|||Last night, the company could not be contacted.|
040031|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_311.mp3|||They need to be involved.|
040032|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_312.mp3|||It was not a cover-up.|
040033|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_313.mp3|||The children continue to talk to us.|
040034|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_314.mp3|||You know the sort of thing.|
040035|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_315.mp3|||I cannot say too much about them.|
040036|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_316.mp3|||She went home from school and never returned.|
040037|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_317.mp3|||I will work on her.|
040038|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_318.mp3|||We told them in August.|
040039|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_319.mp3|||It is not easy to live in Russia.|
040040|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_320.mp3|||Green is desperate to play on The Open.|
040041|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_321.mp3|||What on earth is happening to rugby?|
040042|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_322.mp3|||It is now being examined.|
040043|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_323.mp3|||It is so out of character.|
040044|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_324.mp3|||Otherwise we would all pay the price.|
040045|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_325.mp3|||Our thoughts are with her.|
040046|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_326.mp3|||It is time, he said.|
040047|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_327.mp3|||Everyone believes in it.|
040048|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_328.mp3|||We must learn to finish.|
040049|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_331.mp3|||He was a one off.|
040050|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_332.mp3|||That should give me a chance.|
040051|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_333.mp3|||Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|
040052|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_334.mp3|||It is my last chance.|
040053|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_335.mp3|||We played them off the pitch.|
040054|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_336.mp3|||The service from the other players was super.|
040055|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_337.mp3|||That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.|
040056|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_338.mp3|||He didn't let me down.|
040057|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_339.mp3|||You have been warned.|
040058|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_340.mp3|||We're not comparing like with like.|
040059|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_341.mp3|||I started on fire a couple of times.|
040060|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_342.mp3|||The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.|
040061|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_343.mp3|||It wasn't good, but we'll get better.|
040062|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_344.mp3|||They will be up for it for sure.|
040063|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_345.mp3|||So you let me know.|
040064|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_346.mp3|||He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.|
040065|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_347.mp3|||That will just be the beginning.|
040066|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_348.mp3|||No one can say that about me.|
040067|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_349.mp3|||That had not happened on this occasion.|
040068|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_350.mp3|||After that time, the market itself will set the prices.|
040069|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_351.mp3|||As a nation, we must become more active.|
040070|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_352.mp3|||At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.|
040071|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_353.mp3|||It is safe in our hands.|
040072|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_354.mp3|||HARRY Potter has lost his magic.|
040073|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_355.mp3|||We will need to look at that.|
040074|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_356.mp3|||It comes down to the police in England.|
040075|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_357.mp3|||Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.|
040076|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_358.mp3|||It is a gamble.|
040077|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_359.mp3|||I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.|
040078|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_360.mp3|||The tribunal continues today.|
040079|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_361.mp3|||These things have not happened by accident.|
040080|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_362.mp3|||So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.|
040081|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_363.mp3|||Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.|
040082|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_364.mp3|||There's a hint of classical.|
040083|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_365.mp3|||We had to take action to protect them.|
040084|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_366.mp3|||Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.|
040085|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_367.mp3|||In the end, however, it all came together.|
040086|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_368.mp3|||He is a visionary.|
040087|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_369.mp3|||The warning was lifted late last night.|
040088|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_370.mp3|||There is always the smell.|
040089|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_371.mp3|||I have to take some of the blame.|
040090|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_372.mp3|||And if he hasn't become a musician?|
040091|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_374.mp3|||He is lying to save his skin.|
040092|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_375.mp3|||You have to do your research.|
040093|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_376.mp3|||He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.|
040094|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_377.mp3|||He took away my childhood.|
040095|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_378.mp3|||I have spoken to the skipper.|
040096|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_379.mp3|||The call was ignored.|
040097|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_381.mp3|||It has happened, and that is the end of the story.|
040098|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_382.mp3|||We don't do this for everyone, of course.|
040099|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_383.mp3|||And there is another problem.|
040100|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_384.mp3|||That is the theory.|
040101|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_385.mp3|||It almost certainly is.|
040102|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_386.mp3|||They will have five minutes to decide.|
040103|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_387.mp3|||Because it's a secret.|

040107|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_391.mp3|||They are there to help us.|
040108|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_392.mp3|||It just isn't a defining issue for them.|
040109|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_393.mp3|||You take a risk.|
040110|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_394.mp3|||Which he is, too.|
040111|en-343|en|mp3-48k/p343_395.mp3|||Each one is as good as the other.|

040118|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040119|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040120|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040121|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|

040124|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040125|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040126|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040127|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040128|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040129|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040130|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040131|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040132|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040133|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040134|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040135|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040136|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040137|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040138|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040139|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040140|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040141|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_025.mp3|||This is a new era.|

040150|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_034.mp3|||We had to laugh.|
040151|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_035.mp3|||It is too pretty, it is too small.|
040152|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_036.mp3|||We're in a state of shock and disbelief.|

040196|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_080.mp3|||We should be capable of managing it, though.|
040197|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_081.mp3|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
040198|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_082.mp3|||It is a freedom.|
040199|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_083.mp3|||What happens next?|

040205|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_089.mp3|||I believe that so strongly.|

040217|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_101.mp3|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
040218|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_102.mp3|||There's something about being cut off.|
040219|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_103.mp3|||This is his personal life.|
040220|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_104.mp3|||I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.|
040221|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_105.mp3|||If not, a deal could take many months.|

040240|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_124.mp3|||It is sad and frustrating.|

040248|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_132.mp3|||The whole matter is done and dusted.|
040249|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_133.mp3|||I don't know where that one came from.|
040250|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_134.mp3|||The shooting created panic in the street.|
040251|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_135.mp3|||He would just say it was terrible.|

040257|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_141.mp3|||I don't have any perspective on it.|
040258|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_142.mp3|||Scotland has lost a great man.|

040262|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_146.mp3|||For some, it was more painful than others.|
040263|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_147.mp3|||It plainly does not work.|
040264|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_148.mp3|||His words were not audible.|
040265|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_149.mp3|||That's a huge amount.|
040266|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_150.mp3|||See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.|
040267|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_151.mp3|||It was even worse than at home.|
040268|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_152.mp3|||I still think he will win.|
040269|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_153.mp3|||But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.|
040270|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_154.mp3|||Normally it would be four minutes.|
040271|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_155.mp3|||It may have been a cry for help.|
040272|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_156.mp3|||But the damage had been done.|
040273|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_157.mp3|||No, you couldn't make it up.|
040274|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_158.mp3|||We are trying to clarify the issues.|
040275|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_159.mp3|||However, he did not stay there very long.|

040280|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_164.mp3|||But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.|
040281|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_165.mp3|||We don't have a solution to the problem.|
040282|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_166.mp3|||Miller was every bit as happy.|
040283|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_167.mp3|||The result is utterly compelling.|
040284|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_168.mp3|||But it won't be the same.|

040317|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_201.mp3|||It was too close to call.|
040318|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_202.mp3|||But who is the killer?|
040319|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_203.mp3|||No, it's never been mentioned.|
040320|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_204.mp3|||Things were so intense in the studio.|
040321|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_205.mp3|||The devil, of course, will be in the detail.|
040322|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_206.mp3|||Then another one came.|

040339|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_223.mp3|||Must have been at the bar.|
040340|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_224.mp3|||But this is just the start.|
040341|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_225.mp3|||I can't get away from it.|
040342|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_226.mp3|||I believe in the Union.|

040364|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_248.mp3|||It is not surprising, but it is appaling.|
040365|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_249.mp3|||It is understood he had been stabbed.|
040366|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_250.mp3|||It's too much work.|
040367|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_251.mp3|||We were extremely arrogant.|
040368|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_252.mp3|||Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.|

040412|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_297.mp3|||Immediate action must be taken.|
040413|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_298.mp3|||This could prove a problem.|
040414|en-345|en|mp3-48k/p345_299.mp3|||I was a local hero.|

040519|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040520|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040521|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040522|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040523|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040524|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040525|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040526|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040527|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040528|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040529|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040530|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040531|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040532|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040533|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040534|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040535|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040536|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040537|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040538|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_025.mp3|||A crucial moment has arrived.|
040539|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_026.mp3|||We still have a long, long way to go.|

040832|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_320.mp3|||I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.|
040833|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_321.mp3|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
040834|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_322.mp3|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
040835|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_323.mp3|||But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.|

040840|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_328.mp3|||But she's also beautiful behind the face.|

040861|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_349.mp3|||Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.|

040864|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_352.mp3|||But, at the same time, they made you think about life.|

040866|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_354.mp3|||We will learn lessons from what has happened.|
040867|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_355.mp3|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|

040874|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_362.mp3|||And we're talking Big Money.|
040875|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_363.mp3|||His silence on the issue is interesting.|
040876|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_364.mp3|||I was a little surprised.|
040877|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_365.mp3|||It was a bit like having children.|

040881|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_369.mp3|||As it happened, it was much more than that.|
040882|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_370.mp3|||It's an internal matter.|
040883|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_371.mp3|||They should feel ashamed.|
040884|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_372.mp3|||You realise what this means?|

040891|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_379.mp3|||It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.|
040892|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_380.mp3|||It's not just for classical music.|
040893|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_381.mp3|||This must be kept in total perspective.|
040894|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_382.mp3|||Election results are expected soon.|
040895|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_383.mp3|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
040896|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_384.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
040897|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_385.mp3|||They didn't find anything.|
040898|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_386.mp3|||Is that where we are?|
040899|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_387.mp3|||We used to keep our business rates.|
040900|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_388.mp3|||It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.|
040901|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_389.mp3|||I suspect that it will.|
040902|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_390.mp3|||But there's no eye contact.|
040903|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_391.mp3|||There was no energy behind it.|
040904|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_392.mp3|||They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.|
040905|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_393.mp3|||Even for a British Open, this is different.|
040906|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_394.mp3|||I took a minibus into town.|
040907|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_395.mp3|||They have not allowed them to defend themselves.|
040908|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_396.mp3|||Completion is expected by October the following year.|
040909|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_397.mp3|||It is not a wish list.|
040910|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_398.mp3|||Some of the players have not progressed.|

040912|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_400.mp3|||There is no margin for error.|
040913|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_401.mp3|||Why should we even be asked to share?|
040914|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_402.mp3|||It was not a foul.|
040915|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_403.mp3|||I get very excited by that.|
040916|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_404.mp3|||The members have clearly spoken.|
040917|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_405.mp3|||In the end, it will mean an awful lot.|
040918|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_406.mp3|||I believe in God.|
040919|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_407.mp3|||Which means it matters.|

040921|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_409.mp3|||We can't win a big game.|
040922|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_410.mp3|||It was a stunning strike.|
040923|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_411.mp3|||This is a one-year deal, but who knows?|

040928|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_416.mp3|||However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.|
040929|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_417.mp3|||There's nothing for you here.|
040930|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_418.mp3|||I grew up listening to these people.|
040931|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_419.mp3|||They wanted to show what they could do.|
040932|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_420.mp3|||I just want to get rid of it.|
040933|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_421.mp3|||Officials say the city must achieve this.|
040934|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_422.mp3|||It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.|
040935|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_423.mp3|||I have not come in to take over.|
040936|en-347|en|mp3-48k/p347_424.mp3|||Is this accurate?|
040937|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
040938|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040939|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040940|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040941|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040942|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040943|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040944|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040945|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040946|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040947|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040948|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040949|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040950|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040951|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

040953|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040954|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040955|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040956|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040957|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040958|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040959|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040960|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040961|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_025.mp3|||It was by the numbers.|
040962|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_026.mp3|||I don't think they can complain about that.|
040963|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_027.mp3|||I have not seen the term immediate.|

040983|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_047.mp3|||We know we can defend it.|
040984|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_048.mp3|||That is not the case.|
040985|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_049.mp3|||He met his wife and married in England.|
040986|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_050.mp3|||Instead we were shot in the back.|
040987|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_051.mp3|||This isn't a gimmick.|
040988|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_052.mp3|||I won't go back.|

040993|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_057.mp3|||Now it has become a big picture.|

041190|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_255.mp3|||I wish it wasn't so, but it is.|
041191|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_256.mp3|||The old manager, he didn't like me.|

041193|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_258.mp3|||The ministers are now to make their decision.|
041194|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_259.mp3|||It was like being in prison.|
041195|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_260.mp3|||I think it was his parents.|
041196|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_261.mp3|||That is very important to people.|
041197|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_262.mp3|||I certainly hope not.|
041198|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_263.mp3|||This is a dream come true for me.|
041199|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_264.mp3|||No other country has ever won this tournament.|
041200|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_265.mp3|||There he goes again.|
041201|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_266.mp3|||However, there could be more bad weather to come.|
041202|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_267.mp3|||I feel pretty good.|
041203|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_268.mp3|||It's got to come from me.|
041204|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_269.mp3|||There were moments of humour too.|

041210|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_275.mp3|||This is not a message from ministers.|
041211|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_276.mp3|||We have been very patient.|
041212|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_277.mp3|||I don't take that view.|

041221|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_286.mp3|||That was not the norm.|
041222|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_287.mp3|||I've not said anything to them, they know.|
041223|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_288.mp3|||It is giving out the wrong message.|
041224|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_289.mp3|||I feel it is very irrational.|
041225|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_290.mp3|||We were used to being in control.|
041226|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_291.mp3|||He's had a lot of injury problems.|

041233|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_298.mp3|||It is a very worrying report.|
041234|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_299.mp3|||I started it, but then forgot all about it.|
041235|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_300.mp3|||My mind was made up.|
041236|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_301.mp3|||It was an ongoing exercise.|
041237|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_302.mp3|||I would love to see it back there.|
041238|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_303.mp3|||He then did just that.|
041239|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_304.mp3|||He should have won.|
041240|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_305.mp3|||He could hardly have been in greater demand.|
041241|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_306.mp3|||Who can predict?|
041242|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_307.mp3|||It was all very proper and civilised.|
041243|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_308.mp3|||I've played them all in the Champions League.|
041244|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_309.mp3|||Then you see it.|
041245|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_310.mp3|||And it had been a marvellous occasion.|
041246|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_311.mp3|||We don't believe anything anymore.|
041247|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_312.mp3|||Either system could have prevented the crash.|
041248|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_313.mp3|||Here, the fans have been fantastic.|
041249|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_314.mp3|||There is good quality.|
041250|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_315.mp3|||For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|
041251|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_316.mp3|||But these things are happening now.|
041252|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_317.mp3|||He will be really pleased about this.|
041253|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_318.mp3|||He had no access to the database.|
041254|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_319.mp3|||They were not up to the required standard.|
041255|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_320.mp3|||He also seems to have been around forever.|
041256|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_321.mp3|||However, it has had only a limited uptake.|
041257|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_322.mp3|||At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|
041258|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_323.mp3|||Others are expected to do so soon.|
041259|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_324.mp3|||They were impressive against France.|
041260|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_325.mp3|||Seven people were already in custody in France.|
041261|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_326.mp3|||I played well but missed a few chances.|
041262|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_327.mp3|||Our approach will be different.|
041263|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_328.mp3|||It's my initial background.|
041264|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_329.mp3|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
041265|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_330.mp3|||They're just a nonsense.|
041266|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_331.mp3|||That has not been the case, as we now know.|
041267|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_332.mp3|||He also called in at another farm.|
041268|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_333.mp3|||But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.|
041269|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_334.mp3|||He will go a long way.|
041270|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_335.mp3|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
041271|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_336.mp3|||I lost a part of me.|
041272|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_337.mp3|||It's so much more fun.|
041273|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_338.mp3|||That's just the kind of thing we have.|
041274|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_339.mp3|||It's getting to me.|
041275|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_340.mp3|||So we talked about that for a bit.|
041276|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_341.mp3|||But he has strong links to Labour.|
041277|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_342.mp3|||I am proud of my team.|
041278|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_343.mp3|||I am a doctor.|
041279|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_344.mp3|||Secondly, there are other options for patients.|
041280|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_345.mp3|||It will carry on.|
041281|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_346.mp3|||Our season is not over.|
041282|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_347.mp3|||I am not retiring.|
041283|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_348.mp3|||Money is not everything in life.|
041284|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_349.mp3|||She kept him on a string.|
041285|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_350.mp3|||It will make a big difference.|
041286|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_351.mp3|||There was no basis for their arrest.|
041287|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_352.mp3|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
041288|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_353.mp3|||The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|
041289|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_354.mp3|||The Government has listened.|
041290|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_355.mp3|||It's only tackling congestion.|
041291|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_356.mp3|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
041292|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_357.mp3|||It's too horrible to think.|
041293|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_358.mp3|||It can be frightening.|
041294|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_359.mp3|||He was, but only just.|
041295|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_360.mp3|||It may be his last for a while, too.|
041296|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_362.mp3|||What's wrong with that?|
041297|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_363.mp3|||You will never forget the clutching horror.|
041298|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_364.mp3|||Off with their heads.|
041299|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_365.mp3|||I believe she was elected unopposed.|
041300|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_366.mp3|||We are not asking for the moon.|
041301|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_367.mp3|||Now we see the impact of global politics.|
041302|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_368.mp3|||The pain is still acute.|
041303|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_369.mp3|||This was not the show for me.|
041304|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_370.mp3|||It is a very big problem.|
041305|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_371.mp3|||Frustration is not the word.|
041306|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_372.mp3|||The police have to act to help them.|
041307|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_373.mp3|||The cause is just.|
041308|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_374.mp3|||It may be down, but New York is not out.|
041309|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_375.mp3|||Our message is getting through.|
041310|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_376.mp3|||But what lies ahead?|
041311|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_377.mp3|||She makes me so happy.|
041312|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_378.mp3|||They promised to fight the plans.|
041313|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_379.mp3|||My heart is not so sure.|
041314|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_380.mp3|||I am happy for her.|
041315|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_381.mp3|||Finally, he paid for the movie.|
041316|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_382.mp3|||They were just too good for us.|
041317|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_383.mp3|||He was the architect.|
041318|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_384.mp3|||This should include procedures for personal imports.|
041319|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_385.mp3|||It's a fantastic achievement.|
041320|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_386.mp3|||Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.|
041321|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_387.mp3|||Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.|
041322|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_388.mp3|||He, too, was not satisfied.|
041323|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_389.mp3|||It's easy to see why.|
041324|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_390.mp3|||But it didn't happen.|
041325|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_391.mp3|||All were believed to be adults.|
041326|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_392.mp3|||This is the last straw.|
041327|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_393.mp3|||The research was my life.|
041328|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_394.mp3|||I am so, so, so lucky.|
041329|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_395.mp3|||What is it about this series?|
041330|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_396.mp3|||You read it right.|
041331|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_397.mp3|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
041332|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_398.mp3|||I only wanted to give her a fright.|
041333|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_399.mp3|||Where does it come from?|
041334|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_400.mp3|||You find it bizarre?|
041335|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_401.mp3|||I am very excited about this season.|
041336|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_402.mp3|||It has proved a double whammy.|
041337|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_403.mp3|||Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|
041338|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_404.mp3|||It should be a great game, though.|
041339|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_405.mp3|||But is he?|
041340|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_406.mp3|||So it's a daily struggle.|
041341|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_407.mp3|||But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|
041342|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_408.mp3|||If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|

041348|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_414.mp3|||This is a successful outcome.|
041349|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_415.mp3|||His first album was a hit.|

041353|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_419.mp3|||What's it for, after all?|
041354|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_420.mp3|||We will be pleased to talk to them.|
041355|en-351|en|mp3-48k/p351_421.mp3|||A number of people could not speak English.|

041361|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041362|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|

041365|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041366|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041367|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041368|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041369|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041370|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041371|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041372|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041373|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041374|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041375|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041376|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041377|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041378|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041379|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041380|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041381|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041382|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041383|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_025.mp3|||You can never take a win for granted.|
041384|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_026.mp3|||My conscience is not clear.|
041385|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_027.mp3|||Is that it?|
041386|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_028.mp3|||You have been warned.|
041387|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_029.mp3|||You are not allowed to do that.|
041388|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_030.mp3|||That depends on Rangers.|
041389|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_031.mp3|||There are two problems.|
041390|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_032.mp3|||Lose, and they would be ridiculed.|
041391|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_033.mp3|||It's something which is very important to me.|
041392|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_034.mp3|||For once he was wrong.|
041393|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_035.mp3|||He would not have to explain.|
041394|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_036.mp3|||I want to deliver a learning society.|
041395|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_037.mp3|||We are just happy that hasn't happened.|
041396|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_038.mp3|||I had to be into it.|
041397|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_039.mp3|||I'm so grateful for that.|
041398|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_040.mp3|||It's not been a good year.|
041399|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_041.mp3|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|
041400|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_042.mp3|||I have no intention of resigning today.|
041401|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_043.mp3|||That has now gone.|
041402|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_044.mp3|||Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.|
041403|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_045.mp3|||This will take up to nine months.|
041404|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_046.mp3|||And maybe they have.|
041405|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_047.mp3|||Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|
041406|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_048.mp3|||Is he conscious?|
041407|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_049.mp3|||But we are confident.|
041408|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_050.mp3|||It is like a football team.|
041409|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_051.mp3|||When he came to see me on Monday.|
041410|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_052.mp3|||That's a concern to me.|
041411|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_053.mp3|||She said she was really sorry.|
041412|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_054.mp3|||That will be important.|
041413|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_055.mp3|||But here it is also very bad.|
041414|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_056.mp3|||That view has not altered.|
041415|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_057.mp3|||It was very full anyway.|
041416|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_058.mp3|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
041417|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_059.mp3|||The incidents are not believed to be linked.|
041418|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_060.mp3|||But there is no easy option.|
041419|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_061.mp3|||I can't believe she is dead.|
041420|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_062.mp3|||No person was charged.|
041421|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_063.mp3|||But it would say that.|
041422|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_064.mp3|||Most of the works are small in scale.|
041423|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_065.mp3|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
041424|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_066.mp3|||Only the bomber was killed.|
041425|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_067.mp3|||But he just carried on anyway.|
041426|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_068.mp3|||Nor was it a game without its lessons.|
041427|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_069.mp3|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
041428|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_070.mp3|||His presence was very important.|
041429|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_071.mp3|||What happens next?|
041430|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_072.mp3|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
041431|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_073.mp3|||The bombing begins in five minutes.|
041432|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_074.mp3|||That took two weeks.|
041433|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_075.mp3|||It's worth it, though.|
041434|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_076.mp3|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
041435|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_077.mp3|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
041436|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_078.mp3|||The question was simple enough.|
041437|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_079.mp3|||The voters rejected us.|
041438|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_080.mp3|||There was a definite prejudice.|
041439|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_081.mp3|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
041440|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_082.mp3|||We never publicise it.|
041441|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_083.mp3|||You will be very welcome.|
041442|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_084.mp3|||His musicals were very much of their time.|
041443|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_085.mp3|||He became enchanted with the process.|
041444|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_086.mp3|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
041445|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_087.mp3|||It seems very odd.|
041446|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_088.mp3|||They couldn't keep it together.|
041447|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_089.mp3|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
041448|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_090.mp3|||We will continue to provide support for them.|
041449|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_091.mp3|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
041450|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_092.mp3|||It was looking bad.|
041451|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_093.mp3|||That's what makes it interesting.|
041452|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_094.mp3|||It's nice to be involved.|
041453|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_095.mp3|||It's not a game.|
041454|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_096.mp3|||Buildings are about people.|
041455|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_097.mp3|||There is much work to do.|
041456|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_098.mp3|||The release attracted little attention.|
041457|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_099.mp3|||It was the dreaded sentence.|
041458|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_100.mp3|||I have never considered it.|
041459|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_101.mp3|||It is not in the public interest.|
041460|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_102.mp3|||They had been forced to walk.|
041461|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_103.mp3|||It is harder than you think.|
041462|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_104.mp3|||The call was ignored.|
041463|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_105.mp3|||I am looking forward to it.|
041464|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_106.mp3|||Consumers will also benefit.|
041465|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_107.mp3|||That would be even more disastrous.|
041466|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_108.mp3|||We opened up and everything was gone.|
041467|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_109.mp3|||It is looking very special.|
041468|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_110.mp3|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
041469|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_111.mp3|||People were hitting the floor.|
041470|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_112.mp3|||She was close to suicide at one stage.|
041471|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_113.mp3|||They took a risk.|
041472|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_114.mp3|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
041473|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_115.mp3|||It has no place in football.|
041474|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_116.mp3|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
041475|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_117.mp3|||This is a classic.|
041476|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_118.mp3|||He played it like a veteran.|
041477|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_119.mp3|||I have spoken to head office.|
041478|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_120.mp3|||I'm not thinking about anyone else.|
041479|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_121.mp3|||They will run a mile.|
041480|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_122.mp3|||When she went off it was quite amazing.|
041481|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_123.mp3|||Britain has never had it so good.|
041482|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_124.mp3|||So many people will be affected by this.|
041483|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_125.mp3|||It was all very good stuff.|
041484|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_126.mp3|||Or was it?|
041485|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_127.mp3|||We are under no illusions about this.|
041486|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_128.mp3|||But they are a good team.|
041487|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_129.mp3|||We have a long way to go.|
041488|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_130.mp3|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
041489|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_131.mp3|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
041490|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_132.mp3|||I knew that we needed to get out.|
041491|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_133.mp3|||I had a train to catch.|
041492|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_134.mp3|||And this game is all about belief.|
041493|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_135.mp3|||I am ready for that.|
041494|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_136.mp3|||It is a fantasy.|
041495|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_137.mp3|||The only safe investment is cash.|
041496|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_138.mp3|||That's the way they are.|
041497|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_139.mp3|||Elections would follow in about two years.|
041498|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_140.mp3|||We are trying to be realistic.|
041499|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_141.mp3|||That was the theory.|
041500|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_142.mp3|||Or so it seemed.|
041501|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_143.mp3|||Now we look forward to it.|
041502|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_144.mp3|||That was worth it.|
041503|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_145.mp3|||What's it going to be then?|
041504|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_146.mp3|||Who was being affected?|
041505|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_147.mp3|||Our players are exhausted.|
041506|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_148.mp3|||It is deeply frustrating.|
041507|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_149.mp3|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
041508|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_150.mp3|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
041509|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_151.mp3|||This has been carried out.|
041510|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_152.mp3|||Our time is up.|
041511|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_153.mp3|||It was a moment of madness.|
041512|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_154.mp3|||But other Ministers are not convinced.|
041513|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_155.mp3|||First meeting was next week.|
041514|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_156.mp3|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|
041515|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_157.mp3|||Conditions were very difficult for the players.|
041516|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_158.mp3|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
041517|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_159.mp3|||I didn't think we deserved to go out.|
041518|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_160.mp3|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
041519|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_161.mp3|||I told them they shouldn't say that.|
041520|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_162.mp3|||I don't know how they do it.|
041521|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_163.mp3|||Little is known about them.|
041522|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_164.mp3|||It is a new company for Scotland.|
041523|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_165.mp3|||We're very unhappy about it.|
041524|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_166.mp3|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041525|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_167.mp3|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
041526|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_168.mp3|||It was extremely difficult.|
041527|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_169.mp3|||It is about the script for me.|
041528|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_170.mp3|||I have a good feeling about this.|
041529|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_171.mp3|||And the results were impressive.|
041530|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_172.mp3|||The next game is today.|
041531|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_173.mp3|||Hopefully it will be a good day.|
041532|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_174.mp3|||I was a silly bastard.|
041533|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_175.mp3|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
041534|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_176.mp3|||The process will start tomorrow.|
041535|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_177.mp3|||Was the punishment excessive?|
041536|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_178.mp3|||The police have an awful lot to explain.|
041537|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_179.mp3|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
041538|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_180.mp3|||I could easy do that.|
041539|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_181.mp3|||We are really impressed.|
041540|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_182.mp3|||I try to be clear in the narrative.|
041541|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_183.mp3|||You have to wait.|
041542|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_184.mp3|||I did not see anything to begin with.|
041543|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_185.mp3|||It's their moment of choice.|
041544|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_186.mp3|||I certainly do not agree with that.|
041545|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_187.mp3|||It was a disaster of a race.|
041546|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_188.mp3|||Only one person can claim the credit.|
041547|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_189.mp3|||Maintain the highest standards.|
041548|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_190.mp3|||What could we do?|
041549|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_191.mp3|||O Neill has delivered.|
041550|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_192.mp3|||But there was no going back.|
041551|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_193.mp3|||There are some good people in there.|
041552|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_194.mp3|||But it won't make a difference.|
041553|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_195.mp3|||I'm not going to blame the band.|
041554|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_196.mp3|||I think that he got the message.|
041555|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_197.mp3|||Here it was very subdued.|
041556|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_198.mp3|||Stardom is a funny thing.|
041557|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_199.mp3|||They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|
041558|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_200.mp3|||The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|
041559|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_201.mp3|||I sincerely hope not.|
041560|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_202.mp3|||I'm really looking forward to that.|
041561|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_203.mp3|||She would say he was still the best.|
041562|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_204.mp3|||It is dangerous and it is a lie.|
041563|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_205.mp3|||We didn't, and it worked for us.|
041564|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_206.mp3|||No-one has used it since then.|
041565|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_207.mp3|||The baby was dead.|
041566|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_208.mp3|||That remains the unanswered question.|
041567|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_209.mp3|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
041568|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_210.mp3|||They tried to give her advice.|
041569|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_211.mp3|||We should have no more problems.|
041570|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_212.mp3|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
041571|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_213.mp3|||An announcement is expected soon.|
041572|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_214.mp3|||It was one of those things.|
041573|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_215.mp3|||I can understand that.|
041574|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_216.mp3|||But sometimes it was even worse.|
041575|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_217.mp3|||We had to work hard for it.|
041576|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_218.mp3|||That's a big reduction.|
041577|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_219.mp3|||There will be good prospects ahead.|
041578|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_220.mp3|||I was pleased about that.|
041579|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_221.mp3|||That has not changed.|
041580|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_222.mp3|||It's a creative energy.|
041581|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_223.mp3|||We are not conducting the review.|
041582|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_224.mp3|||It just never comes together.|
041583|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_225.mp3|||The club has never won it.|
041584|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_226.mp3|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
041585|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_227.mp3|||So it was at Easter Road.|
041586|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_228.mp3|||It will be a huge difference.|
041587|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_229.mp3|||Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|
041588|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_230.mp3|||The characters are always the first attraction.|
041589|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_231.mp3|||We've got better players here.|
041590|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_232.mp3|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
041591|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_233.mp3|||This is wonderful news.|
041592|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_234.mp3|||So what's it all about?|
041593|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_235.mp3|||I think he was lost for words.|
041594|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_236.mp3|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041595|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_237.mp3|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
041596|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_238.mp3|||This is a historic occasion.|
041597|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_239.mp3|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
041598|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_240.mp3|||And what happens?|
041599|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_241.mp3|||It is all very upbeat.|
041600|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_242.mp3|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
041601|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_243.mp3|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
041602|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_244.mp3|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
041603|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_245.mp3|||We deserved the draw.|
041604|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_246.mp3|||Just one of those things, we suppose.|
041605|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_247.mp3|||It's up to the defence team.|
041606|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_248.mp3|||No one was injured.|
041607|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_249.mp3|||We have had our debate.|
041608|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_250.mp3|||It is part of his game.|
041609|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_251.mp3|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
041610|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_252.mp3|||But it was too late.|
041611|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_253.mp3|||I didn't see the point.|
041612|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_254.mp3|||It seems a shame to leave it.|
041613|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_255.mp3|||Who would have thought it?|
041614|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_256.mp3|||They were all on a mission.|
041615|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_257.mp3|||Human beings are always the same.|
041616|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_258.mp3|||You will gain from that.|
041617|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_259.mp3|||It makes me feel difficult.|
041618|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_260.mp3|||We couldn't believe it at first.|
041619|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_261.mp3|||The distinction is also supported by doctors.|
041620|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_262.mp3|||He could still be President.|
041621|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_263.mp3|||It can take a long time.|
041622|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_264.mp3|||I don't intend to do so now.|
041623|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_265.mp3|||There is no answer to it.|
041624|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_266.mp3|||He was pleased with his display.|
041625|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_267.mp3|||The first time you read a play.|
041626|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_268.mp3|||There was no let-up for the minnows.|
041627|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_269.mp3|||The bottom line is that this must stop.|
041628|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_270.mp3|||He is having a nightmare.|
041629|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_271.mp3|||That was six years ago.|
041630|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_272.mp3|||Players have to accept this.|
041631|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_273.mp3|||He is completely committed to us.|
041632|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_274.mp3|||Neither had the public.|
041633|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_275.mp3|||It disappeared into the cup.|
041634|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_276.mp3|||They might well be right.|
041635|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_277.mp3|||I have no further comment to make.|
041636|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_278.mp3|||The warning is timely.|
041637|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_279.mp3|||Those were the days.|
041638|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_280.mp3|||The joint bid is still on course.|
041639|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_281.mp3|||A press conference is about politics.|
041640|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_282.mp3|||It was important to bring them all together.|
041641|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_283.mp3|||We didn't play well and will certainly improve.|
041642|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_284.mp3|||They tend to be female and retired.|
041643|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_285.mp3|||These things happen in football but shouldn't.|
041644|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_286.mp3|||It looks as though he will be right.|
041645|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_287.mp3|||We know the fight is going to happen.|
041646|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_288.mp3|||I have played well the past two days.|
041647|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_289.mp3|||Is it on a building site?|
041648|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_290.mp3|||That is the key.|
041649|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_291.mp3|||We've been here before.|
041650|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_292.mp3|||I am in a good position.|
041651|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_293.mp3|||I have never been unemployed.|
041652|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_294.mp3|||We are in it for the long-term.|
041653|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_295.mp3|||But it didn't bother me.|
041654|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_296.mp3|||I believe it will happen.|
041655|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_297.mp3|||And Michael was just great.|
041656|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_298.mp3|||He did it well.|
041657|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_299.mp3|||Why have you decided to get married?|
041658|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_300.mp3|||Is it all real?|
041659|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_301.mp3|||He will be missed.|
041660|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_302.mp3|||I would not descend to that level.|
041661|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_303.mp3|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
041662|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_304.mp3|||We will not tolerate it.|
041663|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_305.mp3|||I'm really proud of her.|
041664|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_306.mp3|||What does this mean?|
041665|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_307.mp3|||They are not falling now.|
041666|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_308.mp3|||We are not physical at all.|
041667|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_309.mp3|||Have we not been here before?|
041668|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_310.mp3|||I've been waiting a long time.|
041669|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_311.mp3|||The meaning is very profound and complex.|
041670|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_312.mp3|||You just have to get on with it.|
041671|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_313.mp3|||The response from everyone was wonderful.|
041672|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_314.mp3|||And that match was played in June.|
041673|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_315.mp3|||We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.|
041674|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_316.mp3|||I don't mean in a frightening way.|
041675|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_317.mp3|||He is a sort of a mystery figure.|
041676|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_318.mp3|||I have learned a lot.|
041677|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_319.mp3|||It won't be their last.|
041678|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_320.mp3|||You've got to have both sides.|
041679|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_321.mp3|||He has yet to receive a reply.|
041680|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_322.mp3|||It has been only average.|
041681|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_323.mp3|||He should be worried about me.|
041682|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_324.mp3|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
041683|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_325.mp3|||For me, any manager is good.|
041684|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_326.mp3|||Eight new hospitals are set to be built.|
041685|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_327.mp3|||That was the gimmick.|
041686|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_328.mp3|||He refused to name the survivors.|
041687|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_329.mp3|||He has changed my life forever.|
041688|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_330.mp3|||I have no idea.|
041689|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_331.mp3|||This plan is all about respect.|
041690|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_332.mp3|||I don't think he played his best.|
041691|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_333.mp3|||Pakistan denied the report.|
041692|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_334.mp3|||It will be up to the government.|
041693|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_335.mp3|||That is a tragedy.|
041694|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_336.mp3|||I am very happy.|
041695|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_337.mp3|||A child is not a product.|
041696|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_338.mp3|||But this is nonsense.|
041697|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_339.mp3|||You can't get the experience in Austria.|
041698|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_340.mp3|||I'm going to miss it.|
041699|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_341.mp3|||There will be no backing down.|
041700|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_342.mp3|||The atmosphere was excellent.|
041701|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_343.mp3|||That must have had an effect.|
041702|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_344.mp3|||They have brought in the replacement.|
041703|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_345.mp3|||How did it all come about?|
041704|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_346.mp3|||We are working so hard.|
041705|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_347.mp3|||One was a lawyer.|
041706|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_348.mp3|||Our position is extremely simple.|
041707|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_349.mp3|||Where did that finish?|
041708|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_350.mp3|||I suppose it is quite exciting really.|
041709|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_351.mp3|||The most important thing was to win today.|
041710|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_352.mp3|||Golf is not like that.|
041711|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_353.mp3|||This is a moment to seize.|
041712|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_354.mp3|||I would not do that.|
041713|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_355.mp3|||Lots of them haven't recovered that far.|
041714|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_356.mp3|||They said that they stood by their statement.|
041715|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_357.mp3|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
041716|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_358.mp3|||That has to be allowed.|
041717|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_359.mp3|||He has never let them down.|
041718|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_360.mp3|||There was no-one of the required standard.|
041719|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_361.mp3|||That would be very good for Rangers.|
041720|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_362.mp3|||It's something he has worked very hard on.|
041721|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_363.mp3|||It is time to fight a decisive battle.|

041723|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_365.mp3|||She has never been back.|
041724|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_366.mp3|||It will set the tone.|
041725|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_367.mp3|||They are not going away.|
041726|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_368.mp3|||Having done it, he was asked again.|
041727|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_369.mp3|||I think he will.|
041728|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_370.mp3|||The package is a changing one.|
041729|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_371.mp3|||I'm working on that one, too.|
041730|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_372.mp3|||Frankly, that's not good enough.|
041731|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_373.mp3|||Or is it?|
041732|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_374.mp3|||What's the difference?|
041733|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_375.mp3|||The whole family was in shock.|
041734|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_376.mp3|||But everywhere the problems are the same.|
041735|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_377.mp3|||Craig is a major concern for us.|
041736|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_378.mp3|||The problems began a long time ago.|
041737|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_379.mp3|||It meant a lot to us.|
041738|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_380.mp3|||What other retailer would do this?|
041739|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_381.mp3|||Other musicians were found in retirement.|
041740|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_382.mp3|||This country has many challenges.|
041741|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_383.mp3|||Their families are gone.|

041744|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_386.mp3|||They are with their father.|
041745|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_387.mp3|||They're all doing it.|
041746|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_388.mp3|||I can understand the frustrations of our fans.|
041747|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_389.mp3|||No, they are not the same thing.|
041748|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_390.mp3|||In football it is not always the case.|
041749|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_391.mp3|||Sometimes we find a person.|
041750|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_392.mp3|||It is a natural reaction.|
041751|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_393.mp3|||I am in a very difficult position.|
041752|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_394.mp3|||I had to win this race.|
041753|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_395.mp3|||They could have been told in advance.|
041754|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_396.mp3|||And what do we have?|
041755|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_397.mp3|||It is a relief.|

041759|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_401.mp3|||You will need it.|
041760|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_402.mp3|||There is so much at stake.|
041761|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_403.mp3|||It has great potential.|
041762|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_404.mp3|||They had three children.|
041763|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_405.mp3|||It was all too little, too late.|
041764|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_406.mp3|||Still, it is a very good result for us.|
041765|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_407.mp3|||And he's not alone.|
041766|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_408.mp3|||What was all that about?|
041767|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_409.mp3|||What's the problem with change?|
041768|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_410.mp3|||I intend to end it on a high.|

041774|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_416.mp3|||It's not an impression.|
041775|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_417.mp3|||This was great for our sport.|
041776|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_418.mp3|||There's no place to hide.|
041777|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_419.mp3|||I don't think they are too serious.|
041778|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_420.mp3|||Tiger is the exception.|
041779|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_421.mp3|||There was no happy ending.|
041780|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_422.mp3|||They need time to think.|
041781|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_423.mp3|||It's unfair on her.|
041782|en-360|en|mp3-48k/p360_424.mp3|||As for Owen, class is permanent.|
041783|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|

041785|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
041786|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
041787|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
041788|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
041789|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041790|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041791|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041792|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041793|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041794|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041795|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
041796|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
041797|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
041798|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
041799|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
041800|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
041801|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
041802|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041803|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041804|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041805|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
041806|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
041807|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_025.mp3|||Something has to be done.|
041808|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_026.mp3|||That is where the damage has been done.|
041809|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_027.mp3|||He may not need to force that message.|
041810|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_028.mp3|||These decisions are not simple.|
041811|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_029.mp3|||The results were very clear.|
041812|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_030.mp3|||We must convince the citizens.|
041813|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_031.mp3|||I decided it is going to be William.|
041814|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_032.mp3|||But we need to keep it there.|
041815|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_033.mp3|||It is a case of taking a risk.|
041816|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_034.mp3|||I am really ready for it now.|
041817|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_035.mp3|||He was jailed for four years.|
041818|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_036.mp3|||We felt it was sufficient.|
041819|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_037.mp3|||This decision is folly.|
041820|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_038.mp3|||And this was well known?|
041821|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_039.mp3|||It took two minutes to respond.|
041822|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_040.mp3|||Why you did it will never be known.|
041823|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_041.mp3|||He was in his element.|
041824|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_042.mp3|||That means an extra two years.|
041825|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_043.mp3|||So, we have to go back.|
041826|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_044.mp3|||I'm sure he does.|
041827|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_045.mp3|||He was found again almost a year later.|
041828|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_046.mp3|||The answer was wrong.|
041829|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_047.mp3|||They need to be helped.|
041830|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_048.mp3|||It is all starting to come together.|
041831|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_049.mp3|||I am the fastest player on the course.|
041832|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_050.mp3|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
041833|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_051.mp3|||They were taken to prove a point.|
041834|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_052.mp3|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
041835|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_053.mp3|||It is an important step forward.|
041836|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_054.mp3|||A final agreement has not yet been completed.|
041837|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_055.mp3|||And they removed a Borderer.|
041838|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_056.mp3|||That is the way it is.|
041839|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_057.mp3|||That was something else.|
041840|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_058.mp3|||This resulted in the following.|
041841|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_059.mp3|||I want to deal with this stuff.|
041842|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_060.mp3|||We will be patient but we will win.|
041843|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_061.mp3|||As good as they come.|
041844|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_062.mp3|||It is not for me to say.|
041845|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_063.mp3|||For that much we must be grateful.|
041846|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_064.mp3|||But the law is very clear on this.|
041847|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_065.mp3|||I thought it was quite a positive result.|
041848|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_066.mp3|||But we are very near.|
041849|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_067.mp3|||Nobody else is at risk.|
041850|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_068.mp3|||We are not going to back off.|
041851|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_069.mp3|||He said it was for sale.|
041852|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_070.mp3|||We have a strong team at the moment.|
041853|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_071.mp3|||This is a dream come true.|
041854|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_072.mp3|||The problem is not confined to the UK.|
041855|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_073.mp3|||It is on the news.|
041856|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_074.mp3|||They said there was nothing.|
041857|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_075.mp3|||They were looking for things.|
041858|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_076.mp3|||I've got to be better than that   Quite.|
041859|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_077.mp3|||I wouldn't give them a grade.|
041860|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_078.mp3|||As it should be.|
041861|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_079.mp3|||We have never been short of volunteers.|
041862|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_080.mp3|||But who is it?|
041863|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_081.mp3|||Kenny Miller might come through.|
041864|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_082.mp3|||Workers will now be balloted on the offer.|
041865|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_083.mp3|||It just isn't there.|
041866|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_084.mp3|||Drama is not one of them.|
041867|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_085.mp3|||And we have a singer.|
041868|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_086.mp3|||It was exactly four months away.|
041869|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_087.mp3|||This is a personal decision for me.|
041870|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_088.mp3|||It's just a failing service.|
041871|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_089.mp3|||We all want to be left alone.|
041872|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_090.mp3|||I was saying, No.|
041873|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_091.mp3|||Where are they?|
041874|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_092.mp3|||I am delighted to hear this news.|
041875|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_093.mp3|||I knew him a little.|
041876|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_094.mp3|||They just have a go.|
041877|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_095.mp3|||If it's going in, it goes in.|
041878|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_096.mp3|||Nobody called me to explain.|
041879|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_097.mp3|||You didn't get a modified.|
041880|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_098.mp3|||What kind of person is he?|
041881|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_099.mp3|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
041882|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_100.mp3|||What has changed since then?|
041883|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_101.mp3|||He knows he is good.|
041884|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_102.mp3|||I welcome the decision.|
041885|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_103.mp3|||It could take some time.|
041886|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_104.mp3|||The girls are so lucky to be alive.|
041887|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_105.mp3|||It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.|
041888|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_106.mp3|||I've done a lot in that building.|
041889|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_107.mp3|||Music is all consuming.|
041890|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_108.mp3|||The results are very positive.|
041891|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_109.mp3|||Talk of a crisis is absurd.|
041892|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_110.mp3|||Which is where we come in.|
041893|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_111.mp3|||I'm not looking forward to it.|
041894|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_112.mp3|||Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.|
041895|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_113.mp3|||He is a pro.|
041896|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_114.mp3|||They have to tell it as it is.|
041897|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_115.mp3|||This could easily have been another tragedy.|
041898|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_116.mp3|||You should enjoy the day.|
041899|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_117.mp3|||He was taken ill in his office.|
041900|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_118.mp3|||We couldn't get enough of it.|
041901|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_119.mp3|||Cost is a factor, but not the only one.|
041902|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_120.mp3|||I am not very pleased.|
041903|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_121.mp3|||It is just a statement of fact.|
041904|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_122.mp3|||It was on my mind a little bit.|
041905|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_123.mp3|||I will just have to be patient.|
041906|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_124.mp3|||I didn't think about it again.|
041907|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_125.mp3|||And if they fail?|
041908|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_126.mp3|||He has gone through the process before.|
041909|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_127.mp3|||Social workers are on stand-by to help.|
041910|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_128.mp3|||We've always had something to do.|
041911|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_129.mp3|||How do you take them away?|
041912|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_130.mp3|||It will be released in October.|
041913|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_132.mp3|||That got me out.|
041914|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_133.mp3|||IT is called a killing in the trade.|
041915|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_134.mp3|||It's a matter for the Committee.|
041916|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_135.mp3|||It will have to ratify the deal.|
041917|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_136.mp3|||I've never seen anything like it.|
041918|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_137.mp3|||It was highly successful.|
041919|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_138.mp3|||We needed someone and we now have him.|
041920|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_139.mp3|||It has to find out what went wrong.|
041921|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_140.mp3|||Only one was from Glasgow.|
041922|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_141.mp3|||I'm sure he will be aware of it.|
041923|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_142.mp3|||Until you hit the big games.|
041924|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_143.mp3|||They received no money under the merger.|
041925|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_144.mp3|||It was a big departure.|
041926|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_145.mp3|||She has never mentioned it.|
041927|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_146.mp3|||I want my mum.|
041928|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_147.mp3|||It seems to have been an own goal.|
041929|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_148.mp3|||Or someone wants to say something different.|
041930|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_149.mp3|||There are no second chances.|
041931|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_150.mp3|||And it was great for me.|
041932|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_151.mp3|||I am extremely sad.|
041933|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_152.mp3|||This series is for real.|
041934|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_153.mp3|||It has still to be recovered.|
041935|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_154.mp3|||The conclusion is the same.|
041936|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_155.mp3|||I wish they would commit to us.|
041937|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_156.mp3|||The driver just insulted me.|
041938|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_157.mp3|||Something has to be put in place.|
041939|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_158.mp3|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
041940|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_159.mp3|||It's a mixture of everything.|
041941|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_160.mp3|||That is the sensible outcome.|
041942|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_161.mp3|||You can see the appeal of running away.|
041943|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_162.mp3|||This means a lot of hard decisions.|
041944|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_163.mp3|||That comes at a cost.|
041945|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_164.mp3|||And so did the rest of her team.|
041946|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_165.mp3|||He tells the truth and that's important.|
041947|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_166.mp3|||Those are difficult decisions.|
041948|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_167.mp3|||The omens are not good.|
041949|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_168.mp3|||The game was there to be won.|
041950|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_169.mp3|||Then there's the casting.|
041951|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_170.mp3|||There is no signature.|
041952|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_171.mp3|||We can't go on like this.|
041953|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_172.mp3|||It is a very demanding course.|
041954|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_173.mp3|||Can he do it?|
041955|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_174.mp3|||The quality of life is difficult for them.|
041956|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_175.mp3|||I've won the British.|
041957|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_176.mp3|||If they wish to go, they can go.|
041958|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_177.mp3|||However, it was a different story in the final.|
041959|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_178.mp3|||I was just aghast.|
041960|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_179.mp3|||They get money for it now.|
041961|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_180.mp3|||I could have been offended.|
041962|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_181.mp3|||That's not the way to think.|
041963|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_182.mp3|||I can see it now.|
041964|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_183.mp3|||Then everyone must consider their future.|
041965|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_184.mp3|||There was nothing she could do.|
041966|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_185.mp3|||We want to be part of it.|
041967|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_186.mp3|||It was a bit of a shock.|
041968|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_187.mp3|||It's not long enough.|
041969|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_188.mp3|||This is positive and welcome.|
041970|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_189.mp3|||Now he is back on top again.|
041971|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_190.mp3|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
041972|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_191.mp3|||Anything less will not do.|
041973|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_192.mp3|||Failure is not an option.|
041974|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_193.mp3|||That is clearly not happening fast enough.|
041975|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_194.mp3|||We were not consulted regarding this appointment.|
041976|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_195.mp3|||You look at that.|
041977|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_196.mp3|||They will be very physical.|
041978|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_197.mp3|||It has been well worth it.|
041979|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_198.mp3|||It was just a feeling.|
041980|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_199.mp3|||People are trying to run away.|
041981|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_200.mp3|||On the face of it, this is excellent news.|
041982|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_201.mp3|||This is clearly not abuse.|
041983|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_202.mp3|||He should be careful.|
041984|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_203.mp3|||Everyone knew the family.|
041985|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_204.mp3|||I am prepared to step down.|
041986|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_205.mp3|||Translation - we got it wrong.|
041987|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_206.mp3|||We will be working on that this week, all right.|
041988|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_207.mp3|||These are serious matters.|
041989|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_208.mp3|||The pace is telling.|
041990|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_209.mp3|||She has always been very friendly.|
041991|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_210.mp3|||Their loss is heartbreaking.|
041992|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_211.mp3|||It is his script.|
041993|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_212.mp3|||I am a socialist.|
041994|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_213.mp3|||The response was really good.|
041995|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_214.mp3|||The squad is too small.|
041996|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_215.mp3|||You can blame the defence.|
041997|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_216.mp3|||Usually the enjoyment is two ways.|
041998|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_217.mp3|||It just could be a good night.|
041999|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_218.mp3|||But we were wrong.|
042000|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_219.mp3|||This has gone on too long.|
042001|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_220.mp3|||It is an outrage.|
042002|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_221.mp3|||It is a performance.|
042003|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_222.mp3|||It is the best place.|
042004|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_223.mp3|||We tried to get them down.|
042005|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_224.mp3|||There were other problems for Brown yesterday.|
042006|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_225.mp3|||I don't know the full story.|
042007|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_226.mp3|||Part-time staff are being laid off.|
042008|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_227.mp3|||Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.|
042009|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_228.mp3|||But they have taken the lesson to heart.|
042010|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_229.mp3|||I just want him to win a tournament.|
042011|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_230.mp3|||Eight others are also believed to have died.|
042012|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_231.mp3|||This time, he will be more on the defensive.|
042013|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_232.mp3|||I will never see my son again.|
042014|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_233.mp3|||But it is being pursued.|
042015|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_234.mp3|||He knew they were there.|
042016|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_235.mp3|||That would end it for us.|
042017|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_236.mp3|||We didn't and it cost us the game.|
042018|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_237.mp3|||It attracted no complaints.|
042019|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_238.mp3|||Neil is never going to come back.|
042020|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_239.mp3|||The years of campaigning have been very difficult.|
042021|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_240.mp3|||Four of the victims were women.|
042022|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_241.mp3|||He was also very happy to listen.|
042023|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_242.mp3|||It's to do with this place.|
042024|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_243.mp3|||It's a technical demand.|
042025|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_244.mp3|||Sadly it is a mess.|
042026|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_245.mp3|||That has to take its toll.|
042027|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_246.mp3|||We want to see the maximum of change.|
042028|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_247.mp3|||But those days are dead and gone.|
042029|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_248.mp3|||However we must not be complacent.|
042030|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_249.mp3|||And that was just the start.|
042031|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_250.mp3|||Nothing was meant by it.|
042032|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_251.mp3|||That was my last game.|
042033|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_252.mp3|||Colour is another problem.|
042034|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_253.mp3|||It is not just the agencies.|
042035|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_254.mp3|||It came in bits and pieces.|
042036|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_255.mp3|||You don't see that.|
042037|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_256.mp3|||They seem to be, anyway.|
042038|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_257.mp3|||I thought they were just excited.|
042039|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_258.mp3|||He will appear in court today.|
042040|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_259.mp3|||Or is he?|
042041|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_260.mp3|||Was he confident about his prospects?|
042042|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_261.mp3|||What can you do?|
042043|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_262.mp3|||It's been very difficult.|
042044|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_263.mp3|||Do something that we need.|
042045|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_264.mp3|||There is no other offer on the table.|
042046|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_265.mp3|||When she returned, it was a wreck.|
042047|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_266.mp3|||Nobody is pushing out to the right.|
042048|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_267.mp3|||It is difficult to say.|
042049|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_268.mp3|||He is not the only one.|
042050|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_269.mp3|||We call it marriage.|
042051|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_270.mp3|||Full back was a bit of the unknown.|
042052|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_271.mp3|||It's not the tour.|
042053|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_272.mp3|||So what is the secret of the success?|
042054|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_273.mp3|||My husband was fighting for his life.|
042055|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_274.mp3|||So was the first half.|
042056|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_275.mp3|||It is still under discussion with the board.|
042057|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_276.mp3|||That is one point of view.|
042058|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_277.mp3|||We are in this for the long haul.|
042059|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_278.mp3|||Here we go then.|
042060|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_279.mp3|||No reason was given.|
042061|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_280.mp3|||I can't wait for it to come out.|
042062|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_281.mp3|||I am really sorry that he is going.|
042063|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_282.mp3|||Indeed, that has already begun.|
042064|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_283.mp3|||But it's the truth.|
042065|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_284.mp3|||We have been here before.|
042066|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_285.mp3|||And he did that.|
042067|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_286.mp3|||And she is very clear on this.|
042068|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_287.mp3|||His remarks were disgraceful.|
042069|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_288.mp3|||I did not think it was very proper.|
042070|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_289.mp3|||I have really noticed that this week.|
042071|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_290.mp3|||In a way he was.|
042072|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_291.mp3|||I will never forget that.|
042073|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_292.mp3|||It was considered to be topical.|
042074|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_293.mp3|||Well, that's all right then.|
042075|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_294.mp3|||No-one is a winner in this.|
042076|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_295.mp3|||Who wants to be a millionaire?|
042077|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_296.mp3|||What do you think?|
042078|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_297.mp3|||They went back to the seventeenth.|
042079|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_298.mp3|||If we don't do it, someone else will.|

042081|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_300.mp3|||Let the voters decide.|
042082|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_301.mp3|||Then it will come.|
042083|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_302.mp3|||It should be easy.|
042084|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_303.mp3|||Is it worth it?|
042085|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_304.mp3|||I will build a house on the site.|
042086|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_305.mp3|||We are right at the heart of Europe.|

042088|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_307.mp3|||They have to get that sorted.|
042089|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_308.mp3|||That is a dangerous assumption.|
042090|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_309.mp3|||Does it make a profit?|
042091|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_310.mp3|||I think it's a good sign.|
042092|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_311.mp3|||A winter of discontent awaits.|
042093|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_312.mp3|||I knew him well.|
042094|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_313.mp3|||I am not ready to walk away.|
042095|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_314.mp3|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
042096|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_315.mp3|||They are already there.|
042097|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_316.mp3|||I'd never given up on myself.|
042098|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_317.mp3|||The concerns were unfounded.|
042099|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_318.mp3|||It doesn't look good for her.|
042100|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_319.mp3|||It was a management problem in the hospital.|
042101|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_320.mp3|||I have some comments.|
042102|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_321.mp3|||You have to be realistic.|
042103|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_322.mp3|||There was nowhere for him to go.|
042104|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_323.mp3|||Not that he was complaining.|
042105|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_324.mp3|||We are very proud of him.|
042106|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_325.mp3|||There they were, making excuses for him.|
042107|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_326.mp3|||It just got out of control.|
042108|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_327.mp3|||Every case is completely different.|
042109|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_328.mp3|||It's all about unfinished business.|

042113|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_332.mp3|||Yet the job is far from over.|

042129|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_348.mp3|||And that was the real problem.|
042130|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_349.mp3|||But then the problems began.|
042131|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_350.mp3|||It wasn't about her singing, though.|
042132|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_351.mp3|||From the opening Could It Be Magic?|
042133|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_352.mp3|||The duties are still to be drawn up.|
042134|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_353.mp3|||That there would be discussions.|
042135|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_354.mp3|||It must not happen.|
042136|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_355.mp3|||That would be unsafe.|
042137|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_356.mp3|||I did not go looking anywhere else.|
042138|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_357.mp3|||We had no idea what was going on.|
042139|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_358.mp3|||If only it had been.|

042145|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_364.mp3|||It's going to happen.|
042146|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_365.mp3|||I don't think so.|
042147|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_366.mp3|||And that was just about that.|
042148|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_367.mp3|||By hard work, is the answer.|
042149|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_368.mp3|||It is really special to me.|
042150|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_369.mp3|||This is a major step forward.|
042151|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_370.mp3|||They haven't got the uniform.|
042152|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_371.mp3|||Well, you don't have time.|
042153|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_372.mp3|||It is very funny.|
042154|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_373.mp3|||I just hope it's not tonight against us.|
042155|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_374.mp3|||This is good news for the industry.|
042156|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_375.mp3|||There are no quick fixes.|
042157|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_376.mp3|||Because they didn't want to know.|
042158|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_377.mp3|||What do we have to do?|
042159|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_378.mp3|||I have never seen anything like it.|
042160|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_379.mp3|||It's about New Yorkers.|
042161|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_380.mp3|||That was a real challenge.|
042162|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_381.mp3|||They will give it a couple of years.|
042163|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_382.mp3|||He certainly would have approved.|
042164|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_383.mp3|||Conditions were less than ideal.|
042165|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_384.mp3|||We want this place to work.|
042166|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_385.mp3|||Father is on the train.|
042167|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_386.mp3|||It could have been prevented.|
042168|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_387.mp3|||We have been going for three years.|
042169|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_388.mp3|||Firstly, we don't know we can do this.|
042170|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_389.mp3|||I think it was entirely the right decision.|
042171|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_390.mp3|||It is planned for London in the spring.|
042172|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_391.mp3|||Everything is coming together well.|
042173|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_392.mp3|||They would have to go to the Royal.|
042174|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_393.mp3|||But we are not afraid of them.|
042175|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_394.mp3|||It didn't matter who was in their way.|
042176|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_395.mp3|||That will be the criteria for the future.|
042177|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_396.mp3|||They thought they couldn't get any.|
042178|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_397.mp3|||He was too good for me - too consistent.|
042179|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_398.mp3|||I am delighted to have her back home.|
042180|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_399.mp3|||This idea is a good starting point.|
042181|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_400.mp3|||She had denied the charge.|
042182|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_401.mp3|||It was cynical and callous.|
042183|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_402.mp3|||It's a dead end.|
042184|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_403.mp3|||What sort of man is that?|
042185|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_404.mp3|||The message was clear.|
042186|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_405.mp3|||We are going nowhere.|
042187|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_406.mp3|||It is truly masterly performance.|
042188|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_407.mp3|||She failed to win any of them.|
042189|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_408.mp3|||It is believed he had been stabbed.|
042190|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_409.mp3|||Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.|
042191|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_410.mp3|||It has a rally instead of a conference.|
042192|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_411.mp3|||I found that we couldn't.|
042193|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_412.mp3|||He is very sensitive.|
042194|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_413.mp3|||That can benefit the larger companies.|
042195|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_414.mp3|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
042196|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_415.mp3|||We told them in July.|
042197|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_416.mp3|||This was a very tragic accident.|
042198|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_417.mp3|||We are very, very confident.|
042199|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_418.mp3|||It is a result we should savour.|
042200|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_419.mp3|||Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.|
042201|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_420.mp3|||We certainly do not intend to disband.|
042202|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_421.mp3|||My life is going to go on.|
042203|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_422.mp3|||It's really part of our mission.|
042204|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_423.mp3|||That was only the start.|
042205|en-361|en|mp3-48k/p361_424.mp3|||But what took them so long?|
042206|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
042207|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042208|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042209|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042210|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042211|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042212|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042213|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042214|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042215|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042216|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042217|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042218|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042219|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042220|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042221|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042222|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042223|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042224|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042225|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042226|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042227|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042228|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042229|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042230|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_025.mp3|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
042231|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_026.mp3|||This is your country.|
042232|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_027.mp3|||Yesterday's performance was exactly that.|
042233|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_028.mp3|||I feel really good.|
042234|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_029.mp3|||It was a fairy tale.|
042235|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_030.mp3|||But there are no plans.|
042236|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_031.mp3|||They responded in the most positive way.|
042237|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_032.mp3|||I have a very strong opinion about this.|
042238|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_033.mp3|||The British government said she was coming home.|
042239|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_034.mp3|||We are a peaceful people.|

042241|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_036.mp3|||He was jailed for five years.|
042242|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_037.mp3|||It's not Big Brother at sea.|
042243|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_038.mp3|||Was this a new event?|
042244|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_039.mp3|||To beat the European champion is quite nice.|
042245|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_040.mp3|||They had a confession.|
042246|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_041.mp3|||As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.|
042247|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_042.mp3|||The chances were plentiful.|
042248|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_043.mp3|||They were impressive against France.|
042249|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_044.mp3|||This is only one example.|
042250|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_045.mp3|||His style is suited to Scottish football.|
042251|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_046.mp3|||The cause is just.|
042252|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_047.mp3|||I am so upset.|
042253|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_048.mp3|||England could not take anything for granted, however.|
042254|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_049.mp3|||They finished second and third.|
042255|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_050.mp3|||But this was refused.|

042439|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_235.mp3|||He is advised that he has done so.|
042440|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_236.mp3|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
042441|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_237.mp3|||He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|
042442|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_238.mp3|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
042443|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_239.mp3|||But the killing will continue.|
042444|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_240.mp3|||They've got to get better.|
042445|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_241.mp3|||But we are working together for this result.|
042446|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_242.mp3|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
042447|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_243.mp3|||It doesn't make them evil.|
042448|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_244.mp3|||We don't want to be too intrusive.|
042449|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_245.mp3|||The most important thing is the game.|
042450|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_246.mp3|||He said nothing of the sort.|
042451|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_247.mp3|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
042452|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_248.mp3|||In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|
042453|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_249.mp3|||The door is open.|
042454|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_250.mp3|||Pulled a huge number of viewers.|
042455|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_251.mp3|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
042456|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_252.mp3|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
042457|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_253.mp3|||So what went wrong?|
042458|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_254.mp3|||We did not play well.|
042459|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_255.mp3|||We are in a very strong position.|
042460|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_256.mp3|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
042461|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_257.mp3|||That is the key.|
042462|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_258.mp3|||So, how did you do?|
042463|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_259.mp3|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
042464|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_260.mp3|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
042465|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_261.mp3|||I can't deny that fact.|
042466|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_262.mp3|||She is now planning a visit.|
042467|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_263.mp3|||We could have done without this.|
042468|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_264.mp3|||Boy is the town a mess.|
042469|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_265.mp3|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
042470|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_266.mp3|||He's a great dealer.|
042471|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_267.mp3|||Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|
042472|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_268.mp3|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
042473|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_269.mp3|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
042474|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_270.mp3|||We are moving on.|
042475|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_271.mp3|||This is not a crisis.|
042476|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_272.mp3|||There's always a chance.|
042477|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_273.mp3|||I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|
042478|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_274.mp3|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
042479|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_275.mp3|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
042480|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_276.mp3|||That's a very serious matter.|
042481|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_277.mp3|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
042482|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_278.mp3|||But it was to no avail.|
042483|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_279.mp3|||Sad to say, it's still waiting.|
042484|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_280.mp3|||It has been a major success.|
042485|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_281.mp3|||It takes a bit of working out.|
042486|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_282.mp3|||I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|
042487|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_283.mp3|||But it didn't bother me.|
042488|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_284.mp3|||I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|
042489|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_285.mp3|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
042490|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_286.mp3|||He will not be coming back.|
042491|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_287.mp3|||He is also a great finisher.|
042492|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_288.mp3|||I don't see any problem.|
042493|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_289.mp3|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
042494|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_290.mp3|||Yet it seemed to work.|
042495|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_291.mp3|||Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|
042496|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_292.mp3|||I have never felt so well.|
042497|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_293.mp3|||There are other things going on.|
042498|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_294.mp3|||All is now forgiven.|
042499|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_295.mp3|||So who is right?|
042500|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_296.mp3|||And this tournament will travel.|
042501|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_297.mp3|||There will be new memories.|
042502|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_298.mp3|||Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|
042503|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_299.mp3|||We know the goals will come.|
042504|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_300.mp3|||How can they get one?|
042505|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_301.mp3|||It was an insult.|
042506|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_302.mp3|||But we all have to look at ourselves.|
042507|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_303.mp3|||We have nothing to hide.|
042508|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_304.mp3|||He added, We are full of anger.|
042509|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_305.mp3|||He did it all for us.|
042510|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_306.mp3|||I don't think that is good enough.|
042511|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_307.mp3|||Of course it is.|
042512|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_308.mp3|||We all make mistakes.|
042513|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_309.mp3|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
042514|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_310.mp3|||That is my commitment.|
042515|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_311.mp3|||This is the only problem with the story.|
042516|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_312.mp3|||It is good football in Scotland.|
042517|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_313.mp3|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
042518|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_314.mp3|||Is that right?|
042519|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_315.mp3|||So other options had to be explored.|
042520|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_316.mp3|||They should be so lucky.|
042521|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_317.mp3|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
042522|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_318.mp3|||It is good news for us.|
042523|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_319.mp3|||The timing is obvious.|
042524|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_320.mp3|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
042525|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_321.mp3|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
042526|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_322.mp3|||I don't think it's very real.|
042527|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_323.mp3|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
042528|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_324.mp3|||I think she was right.|
042529|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_325.mp3|||Is that what people want?|
042530|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_326.mp3|||CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|
042531|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_327.mp3|||I'd like to continue that record.|
042532|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_328.mp3|||It will be a new experience.|
042533|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_329.mp3|||The process itself has taken over.|
042534|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_330.mp3|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
042535|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_331.mp3|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
042536|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_332.mp3|||It is quite hard to track.|
042537|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_333.mp3|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042538|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_334.mp3|||But his attendance is not guaranteed.|
042539|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_335.mp3|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
042540|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_336.mp3|||I am sure all schools would accept that.|
042541|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_337.mp3|||It was quite an ordeal for them.|
042542|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_338.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
042543|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_339.mp3|||Doesn't matter what you do.|
042544|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_340.mp3|||O no it's not!|
042545|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_341.mp3|||The result could be all down to turnout.|
042546|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_342.mp3|||They are in good spirits.|
042547|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_343.mp3|||Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|
042548|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_344.mp3|||He was their leader.|
042549|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_345.mp3|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
042550|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_346.mp3|||So far he has not done so.|
042551|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_347.mp3|||Maybe they will show it next year.|
042552|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_348.mp3|||They are a very good team.|
042553|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_349.mp3|||So there we are.|
042554|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_350.mp3|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
042555|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_351.mp3|||It doesn't make me feel any better.|
042556|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_352.mp3|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
042557|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_353.mp3|||The incident is dead.|
042558|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_354.mp3|||We are delighted with the result.|
042559|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_355.mp3|||It will take time.|
042560|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_356.mp3|||They will do something big.|
042561|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_357.mp3|||The programme was awful.|
042562|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_358.mp3|||It is having a big impact.|
042563|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_359.mp3|||That is very hard, alone.|
042564|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_360.mp3|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042565|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_361.mp3|||Doesn't he miss it?|
042566|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_362.mp3|||The same goes for Russia.|
042567|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_363.mp3|||They went down together.|
042568|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_364.mp3|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
042569|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_365.mp3|||One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|
042570|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_366.mp3|||We were getting very worried.|
042571|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_367.mp3|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
042572|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_368.mp3|||You can't really compare.|
042573|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_369.mp3|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
042574|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_370.mp3|||Plot is not the issue.|
042575|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_371.mp3|||We need to increase the membership.|
042576|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_372.mp3|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
042577|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_373.mp3|||We should not be complacent.|
042578|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_374.mp3|||We all want the same things.|
042579|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_375.mp3|||Maybe his time has gone.|
042580|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_376.mp3|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
042581|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_377.mp3|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
042582|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_378.mp3|||SO, that is it for another year.|
042583|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_379.mp3|||The results are tragic.|
042584|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_380.mp3|||We are not getting him back.|
042585|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_381.mp3|||He was on a horse.|
042586|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_382.mp3|||Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
042587|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_383.mp3|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
042588|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_384.mp3|||There may be reasons for it.|
042589|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_385.mp3|||He had taken everything from me.|
042590|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_386.mp3|||It's a good offer by any standards.|
042591|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_387.mp3|||Yes, it took time to recover.|
042592|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_388.mp3|||The potential is always in the idea.|
042593|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_389.mp3|||I am not a frustrated actor.|
042594|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_390.mp3|||No progress has been made.|
042595|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_391.mp3|||He can win every week.|
042596|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_392.mp3|||This makes up for it.|
042597|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_393.mp3|||My mind was made up.|
042598|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_394.mp3|||The plot is changing as time goes on.|
042599|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_395.mp3|||I never got anything out of it.|
042600|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_396.mp3|||It is patently true.|
042601|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_397.mp3|||Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|
042602|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_398.mp3|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
042603|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_399.mp3|||That is why he is so special.|
042604|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_400.mp3|||You hope he prevails.|
042605|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_401.mp3|||My mother was getting on at me.|
042606|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_402.mp3|||This is a very serious matter.|
042607|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_403.mp3|||It's going to be great!|
042608|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_404.mp3|||That's a good sign.|
042609|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_405.mp3|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
042610|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_406.mp3|||He added that he felt undermined.|
042611|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_407.mp3|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
042612|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_408.mp3|||He declined to be more specific.|
042613|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_409.mp3|||But it looks good for next year.|
042614|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_410.mp3|||Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|
042615|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_411.mp3|||We want everyone to have a good time.|
042616|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_412.mp3|||We're going to rebuild.|
042617|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_413.mp3|||We are trying to do it properly.|
042618|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_414.mp3|||We actually had a laugh about that.|
042619|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_415.mp3|||It raises the edge.|
042620|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_416.mp3|||He is wanted by German police for questioning.|
042621|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_417.mp3|||I had no idea.|
042622|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_418.mp3|||As indeed it did.|
042623|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_419.mp3|||We made a world record together.|
042624|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_420.mp3|||They were outside the circle.|
042625|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_421.mp3|||I want to help other women.|
042626|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_422.mp3|||He got the part.|
042627|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_423.mp3|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
042628|en-362|en|mp3-48k/p362_424.mp3|||He refused to name the survivors.|
042629|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
042630|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042631|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042632|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042633|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042634|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042635|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042636|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042637|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042638|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042639|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042640|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042641|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042642|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042643|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042644|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042645|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042646|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042647|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042648|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042649|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042650|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042651|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042652|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042653|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_025.mp3|||It's never been to committee.|
042654|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_026.mp3|||Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|
042655|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_027.mp3|||It was actually very, very difficult.|
042656|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_028.mp3|||The proposals were not new.|
042657|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_029.mp3|||He scored one goal and was on fire.|
042658|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_030.mp3|||His party never arrived.|
042659|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_031.mp3|||Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.|
042660|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_032.mp3|||If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.|
042661|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_033.mp3|||He gave no other details.|
042662|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_034.mp3|||It's not an improvement for him.|
042663|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_035.mp3|||I think it is wide open.|
042664|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_036.mp3|||It certainly is cause for concern.|
042665|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_037.mp3|||It's on with a roller.|
042666|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_038.mp3|||The captaincy will help that, too.|
042667|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_039.mp3|||That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.|
042668|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_040.mp3|||I think we're a long way forward.|
042669|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_041.mp3|||The impact was immediate.|
042670|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_042.mp3|||There is a new confidence about the club.|
042671|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_043.mp3|||His film is not.|
042672|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_044.mp3|||It is the strength of the school.|
042673|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_045.mp3|||In my experience, he does not do that.|
042674|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_046.mp3|||That is good news.|
042675|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_047.mp3|||This has come as a shock to everyone.|
042676|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_048.mp3|||He will never be forgotten.|
042677|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_049.mp3|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
042678|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_050.mp3|||He was very grateful for his health.|
042679|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_051.mp3|||The nation has his music.|
042680|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_052.mp3|||But real life is not like that.|
042681|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_053.mp3|||So now we know.|
042682|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_054.mp3|||That is why this action has been taken.|
042683|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_055.mp3|||Who will pay for this?|
042684|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_056.mp3|||The defender should have won the bloody ba.|
042685|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_057.mp3|||There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.|
042686|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_058.mp3|||We were upset about the referee.|
042687|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_059.mp3|||That is our objective.|
042688|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_060.mp3|||What's the problem?|
042689|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_061.mp3|||He is not alone.|
042690|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_062.mp3|||He did that last Sunday.|
042691|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_063.mp3|||There wasn't anything in it.|
042692|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_064.mp3|||The club is afflicted by injuries.|
042693|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_065.mp3|||Sentencing is also being considered in that review.|
042694|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_066.mp3|||Lovely day isn't it?|
042695|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_067.mp3|||It was far from business as usual.|
042696|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_068.mp3|||Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|
042697|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_069.mp3|||The show is not over.|
042698|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_070.mp3|||Saddam Hussein is a devil.|
042699|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_071.mp3|||This is a judgment issue.|
042700|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_072.mp3|||Thirty people have applied for his job!|
042701|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_073.mp3|||It was just an accident.|
042702|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_074.mp3|||We are not commenting at the moment.|
042703|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_075.mp3|||Today we must not repeat that mistake.|
042704|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_076.mp3|||Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.|
042705|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_077.mp3|||He is slightly confused.|
042706|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_078.mp3|||We did not deserve to go through.|
042707|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_079.mp3|||The course has helped a lot.|
042708|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_080.mp3|||All the time, that number was coming down and down.|
042709|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_081.mp3|||There is room for me.|
042710|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_082.mp3|||That can only be a good thing.|
042711|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_083.mp3|||I have never seen anything like this.|
042712|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_084.mp3|||They are difficult awards to decide.|
042713|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_085.mp3|||It was that kind of war.|
042714|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_086.mp3|||That is my preference.|
042715|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_087.mp3|||He later told The Herald, It is true.|
042716|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_088.mp3|||It has come a long way since then.|
042717|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_089.mp3|||It was decided he should be dismissed.|
042718|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_090.mp3|||But someone has got to do it.|
042719|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_091.mp3|||We have not given up.|
042720|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_092.mp3|||It was the turning point of the afternoon.|
042721|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_093.mp3|||I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|
042722|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_094.mp3|||What has happened?|
042723|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_095.mp3|||If they are not, the commission will take action.|
042724|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_096.mp3|||Where will the money come from?|
042725|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_097.mp3|||She is still very poorly.|
042726|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_098.mp3|||It was good fun.|
042727|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_099.mp3|||This is a great shame.|
042728|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_100.mp3|||We talk about effective military action.|
042729|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_101.mp3|||I can't get it.|
042730|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_102.mp3|||It was entirely justified.|
042731|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_103.mp3|||He demanded to speak to the boss.|
042732|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_104.mp3|||It's somewhere in between.|
042733|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_105.mp3|||The play was to go straight ahead.|
042734|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_106.mp3|||He had never run the distance before.|
042735|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_107.mp3|||I am the head.|
042736|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_108.mp3|||He is obviously very dangerous.|
042737|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_109.mp3|||It can be very worrying.|
042738|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_110.mp3|||It's harder, believe me.|
042739|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_111.mp3|||We are making no comment.|
042740|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_112.mp3|||I sit at home a lot.|
042741|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_113.mp3|||That was certainly the case for the parties.|
042742|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_114.mp3|||I hope the couples are still together.|
042743|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_115.mp3|||We have learned a tremendous amount.|
042744|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_116.mp3|||But that is not enough.|
042745|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_117.mp3|||These people are helpless.|
042746|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_118.mp3|||I wish him well.|
042747|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_119.mp3|||Only the details have to be sorted out.|
042748|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_120.mp3|||It would be really interesting if they did.|
042749|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_121.mp3|||That takes a lot of courage.|
042750|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_122.mp3|||Sadly, it is not to be.|
042751|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_123.mp3|||Motorists will welcome this.|
042752|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_124.mp3|||I welcome this Bill.|
042753|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_125.mp3|||This is not a problem.|
042754|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_126.mp3|||he announced his plans.|
042755|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_127.mp3|||He is the man to beat.|
042756|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_128.mp3|||We are getting not a penny.|
042757|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_129.mp3|||Look at the turn-out.|
042758|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_130.mp3|||Which brings us to the question of money.|
042759|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_131.mp3|||It is very simple.|
042760|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_132.mp3|||There was something special about that.|
042761|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_133.mp3|||Many other areas are coming up.|
042762|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_134.mp3|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
042763|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_135.mp3|||There were no reports of casualties.|
042764|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_136.mp3|||But it's a subtle process.|
042765|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_137.mp3|||She didn't tell me anything the night before.|
042766|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_138.mp3|||I will be having talks with the workforce.|
042767|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_139.mp3|||Changes need to be made.|
042768|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_140.mp3|||Things are going well.|
042769|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_141.mp3|||Hard it will be.|
042770|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_142.mp3|||I was deeply worried.|
042771|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_143.mp3|||Maybe it will work there.|
042772|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_144.mp3|||How does it all work?|
042773|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_145.mp3|||We could easily have lost that game.|
042774|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_146.mp3|||There's a lot of it going on.|
042775|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_147.mp3|||I doubt it would be genuine.|
042776|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_148.mp3|||It would be a masterclass.|
042777|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_149.mp3|||It would have been a very explosive issue.|
042778|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_150.mp3|||I didn't really expect to be called up.|
042779|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_151.mp3|||They will not be going back.|
042780|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_152.mp3|||The progress has been steady.|
042781|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_153.mp3|||It has no chance.|
042782|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_154.mp3|||His body was never found.|
042783|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_155.mp3|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
042784|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_156.mp3|||We have been extremely busy.|
042785|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_157.mp3|||It appears to have been successful.|
042786|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_158.mp3|||This is a big game for them.|
042787|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_159.mp3|||We still have to wait for that.|
042788|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_160.mp3|||He said it was his greatest work.|
042789|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_161.mp3|||I feel a little betrayed.|
042790|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_162.mp3|||The baby deserves the credit.|
042791|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_163.mp3|||I live for today.|
042792|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_164.mp3|||I have been very stupid.|

042794|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_166.mp3|||My father and mother are.|
042795|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_167.mp3|||But that was his nature.|
042796|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_168.mp3|||We have been together for five years.|
042797|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_169.mp3|||They would never let him go.|
042798|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_170.mp3|||So what's in store?|
042799|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_171.mp3|||He didn't know where to look.|
042800|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_172.mp3|||The German had a point to make.|
042801|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_173.mp3|||There are two characters.|
042802|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_174.mp3|||The only trouble is finding them.|

042806|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_178.mp3|||That was a huge experience.|
042807|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_179.mp3|||Perhaps it was just as well.|
042808|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_180.mp3|||Will he be here for the weekend?|
042809|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_181.mp3|||He can do everything.|

042858|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_230.mp3|||He was only doing his job.|
042859|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_231.mp3|||They chose the latter.|
042860|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_232.mp3|||The legal process could last weeks.|
042861|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_233.mp3|||All were later allowed home.|

042869|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_241.mp3|||That ignorance is crucial.|
042870|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_242.mp3|||It was an excellent performance.|
042871|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_243.mp3|||It is also claimed that he was murdered.|
042872|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_244.mp3|||Clearly, there was a mix-up.|
042873|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_245.mp3|||I have not had much of him.|
042874|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_246.mp3|||Sub Not Used, MacKay.|
042875|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_247.mp3|||We are taking no chances this time.|
042876|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_248.mp3|||He is to be commended.|
042877|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_249.mp3|||I can hardly believe it.|
042878|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_250.mp3|||The goals will come.|
042879|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_251.mp3|||I don't feel like working.|
042880|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_252.mp3|||Then one day it happened.|
042881|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_253.mp3|||I sit in the car.|
042882|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_254.mp3|||We stopped at half-time.|
042883|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_255.mp3|||I was brought up in a mining background.|
042884|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_256.mp3|||All winners should be tested.|
042885|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_257.mp3|||We would like to see them in court.|
042886|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_258.mp3|||I thought his speech was a disgrace.|
042887|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_259.mp3|||It is not a soap opera.|
042888|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_260.mp3|||Whatever we do, we know we can do well.|
042889|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_261.mp3|||They may not always be so lucky.|
042890|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_262.mp3|||Where was the point in all this?|
042891|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_263.mp3|||He was travelling to see his daughter.|
042892|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_264.mp3|||It's an hour of the same response.|
042893|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_265.mp3|||This is the root of their problems.|
042894|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_266.mp3|||Two other men have recovered.|
042895|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_267.mp3|||It will be a challenging film.|
042896|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_268.mp3|||The test case is still awaiting action.|
042897|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_269.mp3|||She is under police escort.|
042898|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_270.mp3|||However, that is not in itself enough.|
042899|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_271.mp3|||That should not be their conclusion.|
042900|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_272.mp3|||We're going to fight it.|
042901|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_273.mp3|||The plot is minimal.|
042902|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_274.mp3|||His funeral is not expected until next week.|
042903|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_275.mp3|||Now we have had enough.|
042904|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_276.mp3|||Can you believe it?|
042905|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_277.mp3|||He is certainly not looking for another job.|
042906|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_278.mp3|||I have a problem with these things.|
042907|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_280.mp3|||The gap is closing.|
042908|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_281.mp3|||Then there was her childhood.|
042909|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_282.mp3|||Other people had looked at it.|
042910|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_283.mp3|||And the other winners are.|
042911|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_284.mp3|||It was quite a sight.|
042912|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_285.mp3|||But he was far from alone.|
042913|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_286.mp3|||We have got no money to go anywhere.|
042914|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_287.mp3|||I believe he could have turned it around.|
042915|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_288.mp3|||The Believer isn't just a movie.|
042916|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_289.mp3|||You are looking at him.|
042917|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_290.mp3|||The best team won.|
042918|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_291.mp3|||It being the weekend, there was no-one there.|
042919|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_292.mp3|||It was an achievement all right.|
042920|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_293.mp3|||They think that it matters but it doesn't.|
042921|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_294.mp3|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
042922|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_295.mp3|||It should be equal.|
042923|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_296.mp3|||It will make a big difference.|
042924|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_297.mp3|||I want to make a difference.|
042925|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_298.mp3|||What was the cause of all this outrage?|
042926|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_299.mp3|||He will have it within two weeks.|
042927|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_300.mp3|||How do you feel?|
042928|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_301.mp3|||It is a terrible state of affairs.|
042929|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_302.mp3|||It was not the right time for me.|
042930|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_303.mp3|||But they have the sound.|
042931|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_304.mp3|||Not all women are dismayed.|
042932|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_305.mp3|||There will have to be a full inquiry.|
042933|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_306.mp3|||It is not just in Edinburgh.|
042934|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_307.mp3|||It's never happened before.|
042935|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_308.mp3|||It was a deeper deception.|
042936|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_309.mp3|||Norton was delighted with his successes.|
042937|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_310.mp3|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
042938|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_311.mp3|||There is another side to it.|
042939|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_312.mp3|||His remit is specific.|
042940|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_313.mp3|||It will be very damaging for research.|
042941|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_314.mp3|||I'm a bit overwhelmed.|
042942|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_315.mp3|||The Old Firm are growing.|
042943|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_316.mp3|||They want to win the title.|
042944|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_317.mp3|||Her concerns were not without foundation.|
042945|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_318.mp3|||This decision is a farce.|
042946|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_319.mp3|||That would be the constructive way forward.|
042947|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_320.mp3|||My view has now completely changed.|
042948|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_321.mp3|||It was blown out of proportion.|
042949|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_322.mp3|||You have no chance of planning permission.|
042950|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_323.mp3|||That is taking place in Strathclyde.|
042951|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_324.mp3|||He was in a mood.|
042952|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_325.mp3|||Was this element always there?|
042953|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_326.mp3|||This is an awful lot of money.|
042954|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_327.mp3|||He was the architect.|
042955|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_328.mp3|||The United Nations must act.|
042956|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_329.mp3|||They haven't got a hope.|
042957|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_330.mp3|||He was a national treasure.|
042958|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_331.mp3|||I think they are right to be impatient.|
042959|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_332.mp3|||We need to regroup.|
042960|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_333.mp3|||I must make that clear.|
042961|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_334.mp3|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
042962|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_335.mp3|||I've never regretted coming here.|
042963|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_336.mp3|||He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.|
042964|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_337.mp3|||I just had to go for it.|
042965|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_338.mp3|||It seems to go down well.|
042966|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_339.mp3|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042967|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_341.mp3|||I don't know, really.|
042968|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_343.mp3|||Therefore there is a threat.|
042969|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_344.mp3|||She would love it.|
042970|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_345.mp3|||One was taken to hospital.|
042971|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_346.mp3|||You did not see it.|
042972|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_347.mp3|||Gritty he did not want.|
042973|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_348.mp3|||The world is being invited to visit.|
042974|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_349.mp3|||Nobody was able to escape.|
042975|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_350.mp3|||Surely the answer is yes.|
042976|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_351.mp3|||Secondly, there is the question of money.|
042977|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_352.mp3|||He was later deported.|
042978|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_353.mp3|||I only found out about it this morning.|
042979|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_354.mp3|||I am not sure.|
042980|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_355.mp3|||One might think that it is a power.|
042981|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_356.mp3|||This place is outstanding.|
042982|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_357.mp3|||Obviously we want to stop the rot.|
042983|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_358.mp3|||But it is a fact.|
042984|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_359.mp3|||They never seem to do anything about it.|
042985|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_360.mp3|||We're going to sleep.|
042986|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_361.mp3|||It raises a serious question mark.|
042987|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_362.mp3|||The work with Alison was a great experience.|
042988|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_363.mp3|||It was great fun.|
042989|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_364.mp3|||Experience in this work is paramount.|
042990|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_365.mp3|||It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.|
042991|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_366.mp3|||It is not needed, it should go.|
042992|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_367.mp3|||She had not suffered any physical injury.|
042993|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_368.mp3|||We have a business to run.|
042994|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_369.mp3|||We have been overwhelmed by the response.|
042995|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_370.mp3|||And there are others.|
042996|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_371.mp3|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
042997|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_372.mp3|||I think we did well.|
042998|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_373.mp3|||Only two things are certain.|
042999|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_374.mp3|||There is nothing to fear.|
043000|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_375.mp3|||Just look at his record.|
043001|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_376.mp3|||He was a legend.|
043002|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_377.mp3|||It is a memorial.|
043003|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_378.mp3|||I have no evidence.|
043004|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_379.mp3|||But is he?|
043005|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_380.mp3|||We were very unhappy with the incident.|
043006|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_381.mp3|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
043007|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_382.mp3|||It is something that we would support.|
043008|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_383.mp3|||It was a double tragedy for the family.|
043009|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_384.mp3|||We are in shock.|
043010|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_385.mp3|||Does it really matter?|
043011|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_386.mp3|||I loved it - and so did my friend.|
043012|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_387.mp3|||A decision is expected today.|
043013|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_388.mp3|||I am enjoying it.|
043014|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_389.mp3|||It wasn't very pretty to watch.|
043015|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_390.mp3|||You have to go for it.|
043016|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_391.mp3|||Are these immoral?|
043017|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_392.mp3|||It has been a massive success.|
043018|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_393.mp3|||It is for the same reason.|
043019|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_394.mp3|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
043020|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_395.mp3|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
043021|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_396.mp3|||He will have something to say.|
043022|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_397.mp3|||You can't take a chance.|
043023|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_398.mp3|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
043024|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_399.mp3|||There is a lack of logic.|
043025|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_401.mp3|||We are about to have our own Parliament.|
043026|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_402.mp3|||I am desperate to play for Scotland.|
043027|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_403.mp3|||It is a large number.|
043028|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_404.mp3|||She doesn't know where to begin.|
043029|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_405.mp3|||This is your chance.|
043030|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_406.mp3|||I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.|
043031|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_407.mp3|||There's nothing she can't do.|
043032|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_408.mp3|||Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.|
043033|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_409.mp3|||I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.|
043034|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_410.mp3|||Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|
043035|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_411.mp3|||He died in September.|
043036|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_412.mp3|||It was not even this century.|
043037|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_413.mp3|||That was really tough.|
043038|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_414.mp3|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
043039|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_415.mp3|||I am happy with my form.|
043040|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_416.mp3|||That's the name of the game, though.|
043041|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_417.mp3|||With him are the symbols of his faith.|
043042|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_418.mp3|||Overall, it has certainly worked out.|
043043|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_419.mp3|||This is actually true.|
043044|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_420.mp3|||Both were reduced to rubble.|
043045|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_421.mp3|||It could have taken another two months.|
043046|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_422.mp3|||Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.|
043047|en-363|en|mp3-48k/p363_423.mp3|||He said he had no reports of casualties.|
043048|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
043049|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
043050|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
043051|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
043052|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
043053|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
043054|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
043055|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
043056|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
043057|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
043058|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
043059|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
043060|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
043061|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
043062|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
043063|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
043064|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
043065|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
043066|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
043067|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
043068|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
043069|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
043070|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
043071|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
043072|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_025.mp3|||Is that not pathetic?|
043073|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_026.mp3|||Our nation has been changed by this event.|
043074|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_027.mp3|||That would be a big step forward.|
043075|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_028.mp3|||I love you so very much.|
043076|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_029.mp3|||Scotland needs to hear it, too.|
043077|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_030.mp3|||Prime minister Blair is not that way.|
043078|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_031.mp3|||But at the moment there isn't the budget.|
043079|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_032.mp3|||It is not a matter of concern.|
043080|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_033.mp3|||We're not either of those things.|
043081|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_034.mp3|||The man has already had too many chances.|
043082|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_035.mp3|||It shouldn't be a problem.|
043083|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_036.mp3|||It was very moving, actually.|
043084|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_037.mp3|||It isn't a free-for-all.|
043085|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_038.mp3|||PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.|
043086|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_039.mp3|||I was not fit enough and it showed.|
043087|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_040.mp3|||I thought it was the only way out.|
043088|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_041.mp3|||We welcome the ministers decision.|
043089|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_042.mp3|||Since then it has become a tradition.|
043090|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_043.mp3|||The concept is simple.|
043091|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_044.mp3|||That is how the Farmer is feeling today.|
043092|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_045.mp3|||And that's the trouble with this business.|
043093|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_046.mp3|||So what did he do?|
043094|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_047.mp3|||We must not give in to bastards.|
043095|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_048.mp3|||The trial will open today.|
043096|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_049.mp3|||But it didn't happen.|
043097|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_050.mp3|||What do you think they said?|
043098|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_051.mp3|||There will be no disruption in the schools.|
043099|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_053.mp3|||I can live with that.|
043100|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_054.mp3|||There is no doubt about that.|
043101|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_055.mp3|||The president took offence.|
043102|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_056.mp3|||Our commitment is to move forward.|
043103|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_057.mp3|||Partly, it is his own fault.|
043104|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_058.mp3|||That's where it all started.|
043105|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_059.mp3|||The family is so happy for him.|
043106|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_060.mp3|||Why has it taken so long?|
043107|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_061.mp3|||No-one knows the numbers.|
043108|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_062.mp3|||You make the choice.|
043109|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_063.mp3|||It is not the fault of one man, of course.|
043110|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_064.mp3|||I knew the script.|
043111|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_065.mp3|||It's not going to work.|
043112|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_066.mp3|||He leaves a beat.|
043113|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_067.mp3|||Perhaps it was her demeanour.|
043114|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_068.mp3|||I see no need to change.|
043115|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_069.mp3|||It lasted longer than we thought.|
043116|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_070.mp3|||They've got more time.|
043117|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_071.mp3|||They made a huge impression on me.|
043118|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_072.mp3|||There is no hiding place.|
043119|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_073.mp3|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
043120|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_074.mp3|||This was a massive result for us.|
043121|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_075.mp3|||It's not in my nature.|
043122|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_076.mp3|||You see - this business is a good one.|
043123|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_077.mp3|||Who is he?|
043124|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_078.mp3|||Scotland were on Saturday.|
043125|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_079.mp3|||He wanted to talk to me about it.|
043126|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_081.mp3|||That would be a big mistake.|
043127|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_082.mp3|||No-one has spoken to me.|
043128|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_083.mp3|||His arrival could be the making of them.|
043129|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_084.mp3|||I was close enough.|
043130|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_085.mp3|||He dismissed the action.|
043131|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_086.mp3|||I said How much?|
043132|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_087.mp3|||I support the stand that they are making.|
043133|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_088.mp3|||The couple had one daughter.|
043134|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_089.mp3|||But was it really so big?|
043135|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_090.mp3|||Nature will not find its own level.|
043136|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_091.mp3|||I didn't have the choice.|
043137|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_092.mp3|||But this has already been rejected.|
043138|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_094.mp3|||They have not seen her for years.|
043139|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_095.mp3|||It was good to score the goal today.|
043140|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_096.mp3|||Allison is not convinced.|
043141|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_097.mp3|||He felt there was no case to answer.|
043142|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_098.mp3|||This is a one-off.|
043143|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_099.mp3|||He liked to talk.|
043144|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_100.mp3|||Lots of others were doing the same.|
043145|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_101.mp3|||It is still holding good today.|
043146|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_102.mp3|||This takes the pressure off.|
043147|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_103.mp3|||Our legal advice is clear.|
043148|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_104.mp3|||But he has a lifeline.|
043149|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_105.mp3|||This is a horrible loss.|
043150|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_106.mp3|||Long-term, it was the right thing to do.|

043263|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_221.mp3|||I had no choice.|
043264|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_222.mp3|||What do you do.|
043265|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_223.mp3|||It would also delay the Scottish results.|
043266|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_224.mp3|||This one would have been.|
043267|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_225.mp3|||We just have to improve.|
043268|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_226.mp3|||It hasn't worked out that way.|
043269|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_227.mp3|||This is very good news.|

043280|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_238.mp3|||We just do not do it.|
043281|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_239.mp3|||It was a long time coming.|
043282|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_240.mp3|||It had happened to him.|
043283|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_241.mp3|||That is our business.|
043284|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_242.mp3|||We were completely outplayed.|
043285|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_243.mp3|||The car driver was not injured.|
043286|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_244.mp3|||It was a surprising decision.|

043292|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_250.mp3|||We just need the Government to act.|
043293|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_251.mp3|||It was really surprising.|
043294|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_252.mp3|||It was a nightmare.|
043295|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_253.mp3|||But this is just the first step.|
043296|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_254.mp3|||We can do it.|
043297|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_255.mp3|||This is as bad as it gets.|
043298|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_256.mp3|||The real issue is personal.|
043299|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_257.mp3|||That can happen so easily.|
043300|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_258.mp3|||We deserved to get the victory today.|
043301|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_259.mp3|||That's the last thing he will do.|
043302|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_260.mp3|||FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.|
043303|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_261.mp3|||It does not take much.|
043304|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_262.mp3|||It would be a bonus for this game.|
043305|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_263.mp3|||I've seen it work already.|
043306|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_264.mp3|||Do you mean today?|
043307|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_265.mp3|||Israeli forces denied the claim.|
043308|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_266.mp3|||This could be the case.|
043309|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_267.mp3|||We try to keep it right.|
043310|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_268.mp3|||I have got to keep the lid on.|
043311|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_269.mp3|||Or so we thought.|
043312|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_270.mp3|||For many, it had become a fact of life.|
043313|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_271.mp3|||Last season was very hard for me.|
043314|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_272.mp3|||It was a definite penalty.|
043315|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_273.mp3|||It's great fun to get to act.|
043316|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_274.mp3|||We are keen to have him back.|
043317|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_275.mp3|||Horses have some sense.|
043318|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_276.mp3|||It goes in cycles.|
043319|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_277.mp3|||And now he has decided, enough.|
043320|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_278.mp3|||Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.|
043321|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_279.mp3|||He made no comment.|
043322|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_280.mp3|||We have to get on with it.|
043323|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_281.mp3|||He was at the game, and he is indeed.|
043324|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_282.mp3|||It would be dangerous to resign.|
043325|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_283.mp3|||It is a victory to that extent.|
043326|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_284.mp3|||Clearly, the future remains uncertain.|
043327|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_285.mp3|||I certainly hope so.|
043328|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_286.mp3|||She died later on Monday.|
043329|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_287.mp3|||It does and it doesn't.|
043330|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_288.mp3|||It will not be today, though.|
043331|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_289.mp3|||We suspect he was pleased.|
043332|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_290.mp3|||I have been here for only three months.|
043333|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_291.mp3|||We have no knowledge of this.|
043334|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_292.mp3|||I was the willing journeyman.|
043335|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_293.mp3|||I know we ask a lot of you.|
043336|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_294.mp3|||When he got up he was hit again.|
043337|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_297.mp3|||It was just one man.|
043338|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_298.mp3|||It's going to be tough.|
043339|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_299.mp3|||You will be very, very welcome.|
043340|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_300.mp3|||I really want to win in Glasgow.|
043341|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_301.mp3|||Is he any good?|
043342|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_302.mp3|||The proposals have been taken out of context.|
043343|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_303.mp3|||It was then that Rangers scored.|
043344|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_304.mp3|||This was repeated the second time.|
043345|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_305.mp3|||I chose the former.|
043346|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_306.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McKee.|
043347|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_308.mp3|||They were very responsive.|
043348|en-364|en|mp3-48k/p364_309.mp3|||We're talking to him.|
043349|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
043350|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
043351|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
043352|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
043353|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
043354|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
043355|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
043356|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
043357|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
043358|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
043359|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
043360|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
043361|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
043362|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
043363|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
043364|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
043365|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
043366|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
043367|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
043368|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
043369|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
043370|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
043371|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
043372|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
043373|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_025.mp3|||She had to learn a new discipline.|
043374|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_026.mp3|||This isn't some form of commission.|
043375|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_027.mp3|||The game today is certainly different.|
043376|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_028.mp3|||We did it in one take.|
043377|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_029.mp3|||I'll take the blame for that.|
043378|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_030.mp3|||And that was just for starters.|
043379|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_031.mp3|||In order to get there, we have got to invest.|
043380|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_032.mp3|||Why did it take a concerted campaign?|
043381|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_033.mp3|||I will always remember the horrible images.|
043382|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_034.mp3|||What you sow, you have to reap.|
043383|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_035.mp3|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
043384|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_036.mp3|||I was contacted this morning.|
043385|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_037.mp3|||He didn't want me to leave the house.|
043386|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_038.mp3|||It's not just a challenge for us.|
043387|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_039.mp3|||But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|
043388|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_040.mp3|||I've had a ball.|
043389|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_041.mp3|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|
043390|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_042.mp3|||YOU thought it was a headache.|
043391|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_043.mp3|||I still hope to go.|
043392|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_044.mp3|||Does that put pressure on us?|
043393|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_045.mp3|||As a player you have to move on.|
043394|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_046.mp3|||It is so out of character.|
043395|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_047.mp3|||I am inclined to play it down.|
043396|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_048.mp3|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
043397|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_049.mp3|||His condition was serious but stable.|
043398|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_050.mp3|||He had reason to be pleased.|
043399|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_051.mp3|||We have a problem.|
043400|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_052.mp3|||I find it puzzling and disturbing.|
043401|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_053.mp3|||That alibi is now gone.|
043402|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_054.mp3|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
043403|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_055.mp3|||I suspect the latter.|
043404|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_056.mp3|||However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|
043405|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_057.mp3|||It is simple, really.|
043406|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_058.mp3|||The net is closing.|
043407|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_059.mp3|||I cannot believe she has been admonished.|
043408|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_060.mp3|||That took a long time to happen.|
043409|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_061.mp3|||It was on fire.|
043410|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_062.mp3|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
043411|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_063.mp3|||Nobody did in those days.|
043412|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_064.mp3|||You, the British people, are the boss.|
043413|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_065.mp3|||Where is the discipline?|
043414|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_066.mp3|||We were very much a happy family.|
043415|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_067.mp3|||They won the trophy in the Hoops.|
043416|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_068.mp3|||This time it is official.|
043417|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_069.mp3|||It's going to be epic.|
043418|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_070.mp3|||She could easily have been killed.|
043419|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_071.mp3|||Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|
043420|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_072.mp3|||I didn't mean to kill her.|
043421|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_073.mp3|||We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|
043422|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_074.mp3|||That money could have been coming to Scotland.|
043423|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_075.mp3|||I'd love to do another Olympics.|
043424|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_076.mp3|||What method of funding is being used?|
043425|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_077.mp3|||It is not a standing army.|
043426|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_078.mp3|||This is a great day.|
043427|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_079.mp3|||He got his degree.|
043428|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_080.mp3|||I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|
043429|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_081.mp3|||and their remit is limited.|
043430|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_082.mp3|||I have great respect for all my players.|
043431|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_083.mp3|||They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|
043432|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_084.mp3|||There is no question of dithering.|
043433|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_085.mp3|||His track record is not promising.|
043434|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_086.mp3|||Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|
043435|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_087.mp3|||It would be very dangerous.|
043436|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_088.mp3|||Now it has been eclipsed.|
043437|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_089.mp3|||Our numbers are small.|
043438|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_090.mp3|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
043439|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_091.mp3|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
043440|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_092.mp3|||It's not right of Labour.|
043441|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_093.mp3|||It doesn't always work that way.|
043442|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_094.mp3|||This was much worse.|
043443|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_095.mp3|||That, though, is not true.|
043444|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_096.mp3|||I'm working at the moment.|
043445|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_097.mp3|||However, this is only the start.|
043446|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_098.mp3|||They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.|
043447|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_099.mp3|||He loved it, and so did they.|
043448|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_100.mp3|||I want to be there by right.|
043449|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_101.mp3|||That was very important.|
043450|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_102.mp3|||Two and a half million people have died.|
043451|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_103.mp3|||I hope they understand that.|
043452|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_104.mp3|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
043453|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_105.mp3|||It's a very, very special day.|
043454|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_106.mp3|||Let that be their memorial.|
043455|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_107.mp3|||We're all paying for it.|
043456|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_108.mp3|||Lester was like that.|
043457|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_109.mp3|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
043458|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_110.mp3|||That is very, very bad news for our nation.|
043459|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_111.mp3|||We were never told it was already decided.|
043460|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_112.mp3|||It was a sickening sight.|
043461|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_113.mp3|||We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.|
043462|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_114.mp3|||I don't think it would make any difference.|
043463|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_115.mp3|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
043464|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_116.mp3|||If that is not a warning, what is it?|
043465|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_117.mp3|||I fell in love with it.|
043466|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_118.mp3|||It ignores the future.|
043467|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_119.mp3|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
043468|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_120.mp3|||That's not going to happen again.|
043469|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_121.mp3|||Paterson was the man.|
043470|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_122.mp3|||The course is in great condition.|
043471|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_123.mp3|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
043472|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_124.mp3|||It is too early to speculate.|
043473|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_125.mp3|||It's up to them.|
043474|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_126.mp3|||They went to the press.|
043475|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_127.mp3|||I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|
043476|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_128.mp3|||We are very pleased.|
043477|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_129.mp3|||You're not going to get hurt.|
043478|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_130.mp3|||THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|
043479|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_131.mp3|||I was very fortunate.|
043480|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_132.mp3|||It had been in place since last July.|
043481|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_133.mp3|||Players want to know what is on offer.|
043482|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_134.mp3|||They are a good team.|
043483|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_135.mp3|||The contest was already over.|
043484|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_136.mp3|||Does it make a profit?|
043485|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_137.mp3|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
043486|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_138.mp3|||It was the only possible decision.|
043487|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_139.mp3|||How much of a cop out is that?|
043488|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_140.mp3|||The whole region is in shock.|
043489|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_141.mp3|||Where is the logic in that?|
043490|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_142.mp3|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
043491|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_143.mp3|||I told the players that at half-time.|
043492|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_144.mp3|||I see the extended family once a year.|
043493|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_145.mp3|||Why is this?|
043494|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_146.mp3|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
043495|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_147.mp3|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
043496|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_148.mp3|||There is something in this.|
043497|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_149.mp3|||And so it should.|
043498|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_150.mp3|||News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.|
043499|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_151.mp3|||They may differ on other issues.|
043500|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_152.mp3|||That's the important thing.|
043501|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_153.mp3|||But opinion was divided.|
043502|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_154.mp3|||Next league matches Motherwell.|
043503|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_155.mp3|||I have been there already.|
043504|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_156.mp3|||My wife is totally behind me on this.|
043505|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_157.mp3|||Scott and Emily were so happy.|
043506|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_158.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
043507|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_159.mp3|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
043508|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_160.mp3|||And sooner than we may think.|
043509|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_161.mp3|||It is a step up.|
043510|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_162.mp3|||You probably have never seen them before.|
043511|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_163.mp3|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
043512|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_164.mp3|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
043513|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_165.mp3|||Something has got to change.|
043514|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_166.mp3|||I made a mistake.|
043515|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_167.mp3|||I'd never given up on myself.|
043516|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_168.mp3|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
043517|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_169.mp3|||That's the kind of production it was.|
043518|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_170.mp3|||Little girls are his victims.|
043519|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_171.mp3|||It is not for me, though.|
043520|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_172.mp3|||Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|
043521|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_173.mp3|||The rest is his own.|
043522|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_174.mp3|||The statement was a lie.|
043523|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_175.mp3|||It is the manager's decision.|
043524|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_176.mp3|||It was a day for records.|
043525|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_177.mp3|||The Government has to grasp the nettle.|
043526|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_178.mp3|||There's no reason for panic.|
043527|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_179.mp3|||We have got away with it.|
043528|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_180.mp3|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
043529|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_181.mp3|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
043530|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_182.mp3|||He had planned to sell it.|
043531|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_183.mp3|||It was just one of those days.|
043532|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_184.mp3|||But it did not last.|
043533|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_185.mp3|||She has been unable to work since.|
043534|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_186.mp3|||No-one has ever seen inside.|
043535|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_187.mp3|||I know nothing about that.|
043536|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_188.mp3|||We have not given up.|
043537|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_189.mp3|||Archer is no newcomer to the stage.|
043538|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_190.mp3|||It's a matter of time.|
043539|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_191.mp3|||The number never came.|
043540|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_192.mp3|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
043541|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_193.mp3|||The winner will be announced by early summer.|
043542|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_194.mp3|||This is the New Edinburgh.|
043543|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_195.mp3|||The stadium was full.|
043544|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_196.mp3|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
043545|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_197.mp3|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
043546|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_198.mp3|||His name is Michael Owen.|
043547|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_199.mp3|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
043548|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_200.mp3|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
043549|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_201.mp3|||This hasn't happened in a vacuum.|
043550|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_202.mp3|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|
043551|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_203.mp3|||Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
043552|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_204.mp3|||It was so unfair.|
043553|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_205.mp3|||Smith has not let him down.|
043554|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_206.mp3|||They have to be dealt with.|
043555|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_207.mp3|||Glasgow is a friendly city.|
043556|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_208.mp3|||No, it's actually in a block of flats.|
043557|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_209.mp3|||They were that poor.|
043558|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_210.mp3|||It was an odd affair, in many respects.|
043559|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_211.mp3|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
043560|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_212.mp3|||We're very close to being a good team.|
043561|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_213.mp3|||All these things have an impact.|
043562|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_214.mp3|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
043563|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_215.mp3|||I'm really proud of my young players.|
043564|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_216.mp3|||There was great support all round the route.|
043565|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_217.mp3|||I had nothing to lose.|
043566|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_218.mp3|||That is just not true.|
043567|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_219.mp3|||History is made at the Masters.|
043568|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_220.mp3|||This is not a European Army.|
043569|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_221.mp3|||Not so, he insisted.|
043570|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_222.mp3|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
043571|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_223.mp3|||I wonder what they listen to?|
043572|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_224.mp3|||Does a lot of drawing.|
043573|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_225.mp3|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
043574|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_226.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
043575|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_227.mp3|||He is doing just that.|
043576|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_228.mp3|||The night is young.|
043577|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_229.mp3|||That is bad enough.|
043578|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_230.mp3|||We used to keep our business rates.|
043579|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_231.mp3|||I suspect that it will.|
043580|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_232.mp3|||We need to think.|
043581|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_233.mp3|||We are very happy with the verdict.|
043582|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_234.mp3|||They want it to work.|
043583|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_235.mp3|||For once it wasn't about money.|
043584|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_236.mp3|||It's not the end of the matter, of course.|
043585|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_237.mp3|||That doesn't happen in Europe.|
043586|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_238.mp3|||Jackson may well be right.|
043587|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_239.mp3|||Then it was the turn of the carnival.|
043588|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_240.mp3|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
043589|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_241.mp3|||It's always somebody else's.|
043590|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_242.mp3|||It could now be up to the courts.|
043591|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_243.mp3|||We can make a difference.|
043592|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_244.mp3|||This was not a contest.|
043593|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_245.mp3|||It is just so sad.|
043594|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_246.mp3|||Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|
043595|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_247.mp3|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
043596|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_248.mp3|||It all depends on the Chancellor.|
043597|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_249.mp3|||I get very excited by that.|
043598|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_250.mp3|||The members have clearly spoken.|
043599|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_251.mp3|||It was not pretty.|
043600|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_252.mp3|||It was like a scene from the Holocaust.|
043601|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_253.mp3|||Which means it matters.|
043602|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_254.mp3|||This is certainly not the case.|
043603|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_255.mp3|||There is great potential on this river.|
043604|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_256.mp3|||It's very difficult to find a buyer.|
043605|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_257.mp3|||Our thoughts are with his family.|
043606|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_258.mp3|||It is a technique.|
043607|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_259.mp3|||The court has not decided.|
043608|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_260.mp3|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
043609|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_261.mp3|||I just want to get rid of it.|
043610|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_262.mp3|||I have not come in to take over.|
043611|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_263.mp3|||Is this accurate?|
043612|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_264.mp3|||But what did it matter?|
043613|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_265.mp3|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
043614|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_266.mp3|||I am expecting to win.|
043615|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_267.mp3|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
043616|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_268.mp3|||I was an athlete.|
043617|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_269.mp3|||We don't need to change the law.|
043618|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_270.mp3|||All of us do.|
043619|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_271.mp3|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
043620|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_272.mp3|||That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.|
043621|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_273.mp3|||We can only do that for so long.|
043622|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_274.mp3|||He got very close tonight.|
043623|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_275.mp3|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
043624|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_276.mp3|||It is our other home.|
043625|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_277.mp3|||Where do you start?|
043626|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_278.mp3|||At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|
043627|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_279.mp3|||It was the first time they met.|
043628|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_280.mp3|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
043629|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_281.mp3|||We are delighted with that.|
043630|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_282.mp3|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
043631|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_283.mp3|||And we're not there yet.|
043632|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_284.mp3|||People don't feel safe, including me.|
043633|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_285.mp3|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
043634|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_286.mp3|||They want to shut the Scottish Office.|
043635|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_287.mp3|||It is something that we will put right.|
043636|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_288.mp3|||I had a good life at Rangers.|
043637|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_289.mp3|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
043638|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_290.mp3|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
043639|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_291.mp3|||It opened last month.|
043640|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_292.mp3|||Just a year later he was dead.|
043641|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_293.mp3|||You must be ready to play anyone.|
043642|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_294.mp3|||This is a club on the rise.|
043643|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_295.mp3|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
043644|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_296.mp3|||That was the theory, anyway.|
043645|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_297.mp3|||I don't know them or anything.|
043646|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_298.mp3|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
043647|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_299.mp3|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
043648|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_300.mp3|||Because we do not need it.|
043649|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_301.mp3|||The atmosphere is businesslike.|
043650|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_302.mp3|||They use them for everything.|
043651|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_303.mp3|||I've already got this.|
043652|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_304.mp3|||There's a story, too.|
043653|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_305.mp3|||There have been different reports from different people.|
043654|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_306.mp3|||But it has all been worthwhile.|
043655|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_307.mp3|||But that's another story for another day.|
043656|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_308.mp3|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
043657|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_309.mp3|||This is as bad as it can get.|
043658|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_310.mp3|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
043659|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_311.mp3|||It was just awful.|
043660|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_312.mp3|||There was a hell of a row.|
043661|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_313.mp3|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
043662|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_314.mp3|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
043663|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_315.mp3|||It's never over until it's over.|
043664|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_316.mp3|||He had been a singer.|
043665|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_317.mp3|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
043666|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_318.mp3|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
043667|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_319.mp3|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|
043668|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_320.mp3|||No one was listening.|
043669|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_321.mp3|||It's not one for the purists.|
043670|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_322.mp3|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
043671|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_323.mp3|||It really is good to be back.|
043672|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_324.mp3|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
043673|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_325.mp3|||It will never happen.|
043674|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_326.mp3|||We cannot go on like this.|
043675|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_327.mp3|||The biggest thing is structure.|
043676|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_328.mp3|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
043677|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_329.mp3|||This is great news for us.|
043678|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_330.mp3|||We certainly have to try something.|
043679|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_331.mp3|||SO now we know the secret.|
043680|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_332.mp3|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
043681|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_333.mp3|||What is that?|
043682|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_334.mp3|||We just want them home.|
043683|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_335.mp3|||And we have beaten them before.|
043684|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_336.mp3|||He has two children.|
043685|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_337.mp3|||That is the fact of the matter.|
043686|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_338.mp3|||It was a matter of choice.|
043687|en-374|en|mp3-48k/p374_339.mp3|||And that's good news for the magpies.|

043779|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_007.mp3|||"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "|
043780|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_008.mp3|||"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "|
043781|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_009.mp3|||"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "|
043782|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_010.mp3|||"People look, but no one ever finds it. "|

043784|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_012.mp3|||"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "|
043785|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_013.mp3|||"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "|
043786|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_014.mp3|||"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "|
043787|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_015.mp3|||"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "|
043788|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_016.mp3|||"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "|
043789|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_017.mp3|||"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "|
043790|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_018.mp3|||"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "|
043791|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_019.mp3|||"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "|
043792|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_020.mp3|||"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "|
043793|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_021.mp3|||"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "|
043794|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_022.mp3|||"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "|
043795|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_023.mp3|||"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "|
043796|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_024.mp3|||"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."|
043797|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_025.mp3|||"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."|
043798|en-376|en|mp3-48k/p376_026.mp3|||"But it failed."|
