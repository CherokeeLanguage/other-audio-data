000007|225-en|en|mp3/p225_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000008|225-en|en|mp3/p225_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
000009|225-en|en|mp3/p225_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
000010|225-en|en|mp3/p225_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
000011|225-en|en|mp3/p225_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000012|225-en|en|mp3/p225_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000013|225-en|en|mp3/p225_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
000014|225-en|en|mp3/p225_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
000015|225-en|en|mp3/p225_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000016|225-en|en|mp3/p225_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
000017|225-en|en|mp3/p225_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
000018|225-en|en|mp3/p225_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
000019|225-en|en|mp3/p225_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000020|225-en|en|mp3/p225_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000021|225-en|en|mp3/p225_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000022|225-en|en|mp3/p225_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
000023|225-en|en|mp3/p225_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

000045|225-en|en|mp3/p225_056.mp3|||Clearly, it can go either way.|

000983|228-en|en|mp3/p228_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
000984|228-en|en|mp3/p228_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

000986|228-en|en|mp3/p228_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
000987|228-en|en|mp3/p228_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
000988|228-en|en|mp3/p228_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
000989|228-en|en|mp3/p228_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

000992|228-en|en|mp3/p228_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
000993|228-en|en|mp3/p228_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

000995|228-en|en|mp3/p228_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
000996|228-en|en|mp3/p228_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
000997|228-en|en|mp3/p228_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
000998|228-en|en|mp3/p228_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

001352|229-en|en|mp3/p229_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
001353|229-en|en|mp3/p229_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
001354|229-en|en|mp3/p229_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|

006133|243-en|en|mp3/p243_397.mp3|||The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|
006134|243-en|en|mp3/p243_398.mp3|||People have a wish to charge twice.|
006135|244-en|en|mp3/p244_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
006136|244-en|en|mp3/p244_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
006137|244-en|en|mp3/p244_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
006138|244-en|en|mp3/p244_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
006139|244-en|en|mp3/p244_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
006140|244-en|en|mp3/p244_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
006141|244-en|en|mp3/p244_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
006142|244-en|en|mp3/p244_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
006143|244-en|en|mp3/p244_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
006144|244-en|en|mp3/p244_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
006145|244-en|en|mp3/p244_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
006146|244-en|en|mp3/p244_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
006147|244-en|en|mp3/p244_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
006148|244-en|en|mp3/p244_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
006149|244-en|en|mp3/p244_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
006150|244-en|en|mp3/p244_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
006151|244-en|en|mp3/p244_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
006152|244-en|en|mp3/p244_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
006153|244-en|en|mp3/p244_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
006154|244-en|en|mp3/p244_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
006155|244-en|en|mp3/p244_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
006156|244-en|en|mp3/p244_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
006157|244-en|en|mp3/p244_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
006158|244-en|en|mp3/p244_025.mp3|||We are a service industry.|
006159|244-en|en|mp3/p244_026.mp3|||It may be good for the soul.|
006160|244-en|en|mp3/p244_027.mp3|||We want to lift the cup for the fans.|
006161|244-en|en|mp3/p244_028.mp3|||I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.|
006162|244-en|en|mp3/p244_029.mp3|||It is about investing in the future.|
006163|244-en|en|mp3/p244_030.mp3|||However, the following year the cancer returned.|
006164|244-en|en|mp3/p244_031.mp3|||They were in good humour, too.|
006165|244-en|en|mp3/p244_032.mp3|||The end result is the same.|
006166|244-en|en|mp3/p244_033.mp3|||It is on the internet.|
006167|244-en|en|mp3/p244_034.mp3|||These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.|
006168|244-en|en|mp3/p244_035.mp3|||IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.|
006169|244-en|en|mp3/p244_036.mp3|||This is a central issue.|
006170|244-en|en|mp3/p244_037.mp3|||History is in the making.|
006171|244-en|en|mp3/p244_038.mp3|||Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.|
006172|244-en|en|mp3/p244_039.mp3|||She was there for the start of the campaign.|
006173|244-en|en|mp3/p244_040.mp3|||She was at the top.|
006174|244-en|en|mp3/p244_041.mp3|||In London today, it was business as usual.|
006175|244-en|en|mp3/p244_042.mp3|||And they had a case.|
006176|244-en|en|mp3/p244_043.mp3|||Something has to be put in place.|
006177|244-en|en|mp3/p244_044.mp3|||If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.|
006178|244-en|en|mp3/p244_045.mp3|||They are going after them.|
006179|244-en|en|mp3/p244_046.mp3|||It is all about the story.|
006180|244-en|en|mp3/p244_047.mp3|||The whole thing is the music.|
006181|244-en|en|mp3/p244_048.mp3|||In fact, they are the future of investment.|
006182|244-en|en|mp3/p244_049.mp3|||That is still the case.|
006183|244-en|en|mp3/p244_050.mp3|||At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.|
006184|244-en|en|mp3/p244_051.mp3|||In my view, it has to be done.|
006185|244-en|en|mp3/p244_052.mp3|||The pressure on the players will build.|
006186|244-en|en|mp3/p244_053.mp3|||Their campaign is in disarray.|
006187|244-en|en|mp3/p244_054.mp3|||But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.|
006188|244-en|en|mp3/p244_055.mp3|||Yesterday, he was busy in his office.|
006189|244-en|en|mp3/p244_056.mp3|||It has been a horrible, horrible time.|
006190|244-en|en|mp3/p244_057.mp3|||Clearly, they had other problems.|
006191|244-en|en|mp3/p244_058.mp3|||This trend is likely to strengthen.|
006192|244-en|en|mp3/p244_059.mp3|||For the meantime, though, the signs are good.|
006193|244-en|en|mp3/p244_060.mp3|||We have got to deliver.|
006194|244-en|en|mp3/p244_061.mp3|||That was the difference today.|
006195|244-en|en|mp3/p244_062.mp3|||The company continues to grow.|
006196|244-en|en|mp3/p244_063.mp3|||He said it was for sale.|
006197|244-en|en|mp3/p244_064.mp3|||We felt it was sufficient.|
006198|244-en|en|mp3/p244_065.mp3|||That is all in the past.|
006199|244-en|en|mp3/p244_066.mp3|||There is a lot to be done.|
006200|244-en|en|mp3/p244_067.mp3|||But that's another story for another day.|
006201|244-en|en|mp3/p244_068.mp3|||He has not been dropped.|
006202|244-en|en|mp3/p244_069.mp3|||It was an outstanding performance.|
006203|244-en|en|mp3/p244_070.mp3|||I can't remember a lot about the accident.|
006204|244-en|en|mp3/p244_071.mp3|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
006205|244-en|en|mp3/p244_072.mp3|||It is only the beginning.|
006206|244-en|en|mp3/p244_073.mp3|||Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.|
006207|244-en|en|mp3/p244_074.mp3|||Only water is currently allowed.|
006208|244-en|en|mp3/p244_075.mp3|||This time, it might be for real.|
006209|244-en|en|mp3/p244_076.mp3|||She did that for the rest of her life.|
006210|244-en|en|mp3/p244_077.mp3|||Seriously, we are not concerned at all.|
006211|244-en|en|mp3/p244_078.mp3|||That will be the office.|
006212|244-en|en|mp3/p244_079.mp3|||Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?|
006213|244-en|en|mp3/p244_080.mp3|||How are you, sir ?|
006214|244-en|en|mp3/p244_081.mp3|||So is that it, then ?|
006215|244-en|en|mp3/p244_082.mp3|||Do I have a favourite ?|
006216|244-en|en|mp3/p244_083.mp3|||What do we do ?|
006217|244-en|en|mp3/p244_084.mp3|||Why do it otherwise ?|
006218|244-en|en|mp3/p244_085.mp3|||It starts with the script.|
006219|244-en|en|mp3/p244_086.mp3|||Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.|
006220|244-en|en|mp3/p244_087.mp3|||It would have been around the turn of the century.|
006221|244-en|en|mp3/p244_088.mp3|||I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.|
006222|244-en|en|mp3/p244_089.mp3|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
006223|244-en|en|mp3/p244_090.mp3|||It seems a good thing to try.|
006224|244-en|en|mp3/p244_091.mp3|||However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.|
006225|244-en|en|mp3/p244_092.mp3|||It sounds a lot of money.|
006226|244-en|en|mp3/p244_093.mp3|||However, a ruling will not come before next week.|
006227|244-en|en|mp3/p244_094.mp3|||It is not a story.|
006228|244-en|en|mp3/p244_095.mp3|||However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.|
006229|244-en|en|mp3/p244_096.mp3|||He is in the US.|
006230|244-en|en|mp3/p244_097.mp3|||I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.|
006231|244-en|en|mp3/p244_098.mp3|||It took an option on the process.|
006232|244-en|en|mp3/p244_099.mp3|||By then, he was walking on water.|
006233|244-en|en|mp3/p244_100.mp3|||This is a game of confidence.|
006234|244-en|en|mp3/p244_101.mp3|||On Saturday, it was much the same.|
006235|244-en|en|mp3/p244_102.mp3|||He liked the weather, the courses, the food.|
006236|244-en|en|mp3/p244_103.mp3|||The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.|
006237|244-en|en|mp3/p244_104.mp3|||The trick is to try it.|
006238|244-en|en|mp3/p244_105.mp3|||I had no intention of misleading anyone.|
006239|244-en|en|mp3/p244_106.mp3|||Victory was never in doubt.|
006240|244-en|en|mp3/p244_107.mp3|||This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.|
006241|244-en|en|mp3/p244_108.mp3|||On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.|
006242|244-en|en|mp3/p244_109.mp3|||Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.|
006243|244-en|en|mp3/p244_110.mp3|||Then again, we could have.|
006244|244-en|en|mp3/p244_111.mp3|||There, you were just a body.|
006245|244-en|en|mp3/p244_112.mp3|||But he has not become a monster.|
006246|244-en|en|mp3/p244_113.mp3|||He is not a dancer.|
006247|244-en|en|mp3/p244_114.mp3|||We had planned to sell the property for some time.|
006248|244-en|en|mp3/p244_115.mp3|||A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.|
006249|244-en|en|mp3/p244_116.mp3|||In the end we have to take a stand.|
006250|244-en|en|mp3/p244_117.mp3|||This is a sea change in approach.|
006251|244-en|en|mp3/p244_118.mp3|||Otherwise, the market may come back.|
006252|244-en|en|mp3/p244_119.mp3|||The procedures were not in place.|
006253|244-en|en|mp3/p244_120.mp3|||For these people, the ruling is very welcome.|
006254|244-en|en|mp3/p244_121.mp3|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
006255|244-en|en|mp3/p244_122.mp3|||He was not alone at the top of the board.|
006256|244-en|en|mp3/p244_123.mp3|||The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.|
006257|244-en|en|mp3/p244_124.mp3|||While they went on holiday, we got the contract.|
006258|244-en|en|mp3/p244_125.mp3|||We had a great time.|
006259|244-en|en|mp3/p244_126.mp3|||I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.|
006260|244-en|en|mp3/p244_127.mp3|||According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.|
006261|244-en|en|mp3/p244_128.mp3|||It was far from business as usual.|
006262|244-en|en|mp3/p244_129.mp3|||He wanted to record the group.|
006263|244-en|en|mp3/p244_130.mp3|||He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.|
006264|244-en|en|mp3/p244_131.mp3|||Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.|
006265|244-en|en|mp3/p244_132.mp3|||It is hard to believe.|
006266|244-en|en|mp3/p244_133.mp3|||Or it would have been.|
006267|244-en|en|mp3/p244_134.mp3|||Three days later, he was killed.|
006268|244-en|en|mp3/p244_135.mp3|||Football is a passion for many.|
006269|244-en|en|mp3/p244_136.mp3|||What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?|
006270|244-en|en|mp3/p244_137.mp3|||So, did she meet him ?|
006271|244-en|en|mp3/p244_138.mp3|||So what is the campaign about ?|
006272|244-en|en|mp3/p244_139.mp3|||And does it ?|
006273|244-en|en|mp3/p244_140.mp3|||Are you from the rugby ?|
006274|244-en|en|mp3/p244_141.mp3|||However, the bank denied that he was in the running.|
006275|244-en|en|mp3/p244_142.mp3|||That was the first step.|
006276|244-en|en|mp3/p244_143.mp3|||However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.|
006277|244-en|en|mp3/p244_144.mp3|||I have been in contact with him.|
006278|244-en|en|mp3/p244_145.mp3|||Actors like to be in the centre.|
006279|244-en|en|mp3/p244_146.mp3|||When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.|
006280|244-en|en|mp3/p244_147.mp3|||They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.|
006281|244-en|en|mp3/p244_148.mp3|||I am the manager of Scotland.|
006282|244-en|en|mp3/p244_149.mp3|||There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.|
006283|244-en|en|mp3/p244_150.mp3|||There were no grounds for his action.|
006284|244-en|en|mp3/p244_151.mp3|||I can't even get into the A team.|
006285|244-en|en|mp3/p244_152.mp3|||It starts at the top.|
006286|244-en|en|mp3/p244_153.mp3|||Others are expected to follow the lead.|
006287|244-en|en|mp3/p244_154.mp3|||She does not want to speak.|
006288|244-en|en|mp3/p244_155.mp3|||It was all for good reason as well.|
006289|244-en|en|mp3/p244_156.mp3|||One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.|
006290|244-en|en|mp3/p244_157.mp3|||It is the latter which has prompted the warning.|
006291|244-en|en|mp3/p244_158.mp3|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
006292|244-en|en|mp3/p244_159.mp3|||If not, a deal could take many months.|
006293|244-en|en|mp3/p244_160.mp3|||We want to get there.|
006294|244-en|en|mp3/p244_161.mp3|||On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.|
006295|244-en|en|mp3/p244_162.mp3|||There is a lack of staff.|
006296|244-en|en|mp3/p244_163.mp3|||Not that the occasion was without restraint.|
006297|244-en|en|mp3/p244_164.mp3|||Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.|
006298|244-en|en|mp3/p244_165.mp3|||This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.|
006299|244-en|en|mp3/p244_166.mp3|||At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.|
006300|244-en|en|mp3/p244_167.mp3|||Full consent is expected by the end of next year.|
006301|244-en|en|mp3/p244_168.mp3|||Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.|
006302|244-en|en|mp3/p244_169.mp3|||Anyone can do the sums.|
006303|244-en|en|mp3/p244_170.mp3|||We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.|
006304|244-en|en|mp3/p244_171.mp3|||It is not about the money, it is about everything.|
006305|244-en|en|mp3/p244_172.mp3|||Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.|
006306|244-en|en|mp3/p244_173.mp3|||We were all over the place in the first half.|
006307|244-en|en|mp3/p244_174.mp3|||Like the others, he was arrested.|
006308|244-en|en|mp3/p244_175.mp3|||All the pressure was on him.|
006309|244-en|en|mp3/p244_176.mp3|||Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.|
006310|244-en|en|mp3/p244_177.mp3|||They have not been named.|
006311|244-en|en|mp3/p244_178.mp3|||It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.|
006312|244-en|en|mp3/p244_179.mp3|||I think the Labour party is completely split on this.|
006313|244-en|en|mp3/p244_180.mp3|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|
006314|244-en|en|mp3/p244_181.mp3|||I was always in control.|
006315|244-en|en|mp3/p244_182.mp3|||It was by the numbers.|
006316|244-en|en|mp3/p244_183.mp3|||I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.|
006317|244-en|en|mp3/p244_184.mp3|||It should never have happened.|
006318|244-en|en|mp3/p244_185.mp3|||Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.|
006319|244-en|en|mp3/p244_186.mp3|||The feeling is hard to describe.|
006320|244-en|en|mp3/p244_187.mp3|||It is difficult to say.|
006321|244-en|en|mp3/p244_188.mp3|||That is a question for the next manager.|
006322|244-en|en|mp3/p244_189.mp3|||By then, however, both men were already in the US.|
006323|244-en|en|mp3/p244_190.mp3|||However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.|
006324|244-en|en|mp3/p244_191.mp3|||It is simply not true.|
006325|244-en|en|mp3/p244_192.mp3|||Are you going to win ?|
006326|244-en|en|mp3/p244_193.mp3|||Was it the wife ?|
006327|244-en|en|mp3/p244_194.mp3|||Why change it ?|
006328|244-en|en|mp3/p244_195.mp3|||What do we want to do that for ?|
006329|244-en|en|mp3/p244_196.mp3|||Does the name matter ?|
006330|244-en|en|mp3/p244_197.mp3|||That you can do it.|
006331|244-en|en|mp3/p244_198.mp3|||I would like to continue to develop.|
006332|244-en|en|mp3/p244_199.mp3|||First and foremost, the game is entirely different.|
006333|244-en|en|mp3/p244_200.mp3|||He has defended the system.|
006334|244-en|en|mp3/p244_201.mp3|||We want to begin a programme in the UK.|
006335|244-en|en|mp3/p244_203.mp3|||At the top level, the salaries are far too high.|
006336|244-en|en|mp3/p244_204.mp3|||It is not an issue.|
006337|244-en|en|mp3/p244_205.mp3|||They have to get that sorted.|
006338|244-en|en|mp3/p244_206.mp3|||We can take the city.|
006339|244-en|en|mp3/p244_207.mp3|||He played it like a veteran.|
006340|244-en|en|mp3/p244_208.mp3|||It was the story of the second half.|
006341|244-en|en|mp3/p244_209.mp3|||Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.|
006342|244-en|en|mp3/p244_210.mp3|||As many as the market will support.|
006343|244-en|en|mp3/p244_211.mp3|||He is believed to live in Britain.|
006344|244-en|en|mp3/p244_212.mp3|||Hopefully, it will bring new customers.|
006345|244-en|en|mp3/p244_213.mp3|||The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.|
006346|244-en|en|mp3/p244_214.mp3|||This conference was never confirmed.|
006347|244-en|en|mp3/p244_215.mp3|||A team is a team.|
006348|244-en|en|mp3/p244_216.mp3|||However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.|
006349|244-en|en|mp3/p244_217.mp3|||I'm interested in interesting work.|
006350|244-en|en|mp3/p244_218.mp3|||It decided to blame the media.|
006351|244-en|en|mp3/p244_219.mp3|||THE force is with them.|
006352|244-en|en|mp3/p244_220.mp3|||This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.|
006353|244-en|en|mp3/p244_221.mp3|||It was important to win today.|
006354|244-en|en|mp3/p244_222.mp3|||He was not injured in the attack.|
006355|244-en|en|mp3/p244_223.mp3|||Because he was born in England.|
006356|244-en|en|mp3/p244_224.mp3|||Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.|
006357|244-en|en|mp3/p244_225.mp3|||Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.|
006358|244-en|en|mp3/p244_226.mp3|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
006359|244-en|en|mp3/p244_227.mp3|||However, it is not as simple as this.|
006360|244-en|en|mp3/p244_228.mp3|||We want this place to work.|
006361|244-en|en|mp3/p244_229.mp3|||It still has an effect.|
006362|244-en|en|mp3/p244_230.mp3|||The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.|
006363|244-en|en|mp3/p244_231.mp3|||I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.|
006364|244-en|en|mp3/p244_232.mp3|||Other villages were completely deserted.|
006365|244-en|en|mp3/p244_233.mp3|||There is a lot of concern.|
006366|244-en|en|mp3/p244_234.mp3|||It will be decided in the next month.|
006367|244-en|en|mp3/p244_235.mp3|||We have to win the group.|
006368|244-en|en|mp3/p244_236.mp3|||It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.|
006369|244-en|en|mp3/p244_237.mp3|||We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.|
006370|244-en|en|mp3/p244_238.mp3|||We have an election in eight days.|
006371|244-en|en|mp3/p244_239.mp3|||There was a lot of resentment.|
006372|244-en|en|mp3/p244_240.mp3|||This is a fight to the death.|
006373|244-en|en|mp3/p244_241.mp3|||All will be revealed in due course.|
006374|244-en|en|mp3/p244_242.mp3|||He is a man of the people.|
006375|244-en|en|mp3/p244_243.mp3|||The matter is under appeal.|
006376|244-en|en|mp3/p244_244.mp3|||And they were being paid ?|
006377|244-en|en|mp3/p244_245.mp3|||was everything done to save people ?|
006378|244-en|en|mp3/p244_246.mp3|||What was the matter for concern ?|
006379|244-en|en|mp3/p244_247.mp3|||Do I think about them often ?|
006380|244-en|en|mp3/p244_248.mp3|||Is it in the right place ?|
006381|244-en|en|mp3/p244_249.mp3|||Did he trip ?|
006382|244-en|en|mp3/p244_250.mp3|||Sadly, it could not be done.|
006383|244-en|en|mp3/p244_251.mp3|||I wouldn't even respond to that question.|
006384|244-en|en|mp3/p244_252.mp3|||Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.|
006385|244-en|en|mp3/p244_253.mp3|||Instead, he missed the lot.|
006386|244-en|en|mp3/p244_254.mp3|||I was never in danger.|
006387|244-en|en|mp3/p244_255.mp3|||A lot has been written.|
006388|244-en|en|mp3/p244_256.mp3|||In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.|
006389|244-en|en|mp3/p244_257.mp3|||It was really good in the first week.|
006390|244-en|en|mp3/p244_258.mp3|||If it doesn't, it doesn't.|
006391|244-en|en|mp3/p244_259.mp3|||However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.|
006392|244-en|en|mp3/p244_260.mp3|||That is not the case in Europe.|
006393|244-en|en|mp3/p244_261.mp3|||But it was a loss.|
006394|244-en|en|mp3/p244_262.mp3|||So far, the problems have occurred in the US.|
006395|244-en|en|mp3/p244_263.mp3|||The performance continues to improve.|
006396|244-en|en|mp3/p244_264.mp3|||It expected this trend to continue.|
006397|244-en|en|mp3/p244_265.mp3|||However, no further action was taken by police.|
006398|244-en|en|mp3/p244_266.mp3|||It depends on Labour, not on us.|
006399|244-en|en|mp3/p244_267.mp3|||But we were in control at that point.|
006400|244-en|en|mp3/p244_268.mp3|||It has to be enforced.|
006401|244-en|en|mp3/p244_269.mp3|||The party has never fully recovered.|
006402|244-en|en|mp3/p244_270.mp3|||Moreover, it must be for all sports.|
006403|244-en|en|mp3/p244_271.mp3|||But the government has so far failed to listen.|
006404|244-en|en|mp3/p244_272.mp3|||He must have a crack at it.|
006405|244-en|en|mp3/p244_273.mp3|||I am still waiting for a reply.|
006406|244-en|en|mp3/p244_274.mp3|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
006407|244-en|en|mp3/p244_275.mp3|||He was good, but not that good.|
006408|244-en|en|mp3/p244_276.mp3|||The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.|
006409|244-en|en|mp3/p244_277.mp3|||Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.|
006410|244-en|en|mp3/p244_278.mp3|||However, the matter is not going to end there.|
006411|244-en|en|mp3/p244_279.mp3|||It might be sad, but it's a fact.|
006412|244-en|en|mp3/p244_280.mp3|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
006413|244-en|en|mp3/p244_281.mp3|||Obviously, we would want to look at this.|
006414|244-en|en|mp3/p244_282.mp3|||On a practical level, it would be difficult.|
006415|244-en|en|mp3/p244_283.mp3|||If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.|
006416|244-en|en|mp3/p244_284.mp3|||It is important that he is involved.|
006417|244-en|en|mp3/p244_285.mp3|||If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.|
006418|244-en|en|mp3/p244_286.mp3|||It should be noted that he has been released without charge.|
006419|244-en|en|mp3/p244_287.mp3|||In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.|
006420|244-en|en|mp3/p244_288.mp3|||Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.|
006421|244-en|en|mp3/p244_290.mp3|||I should think so, too.|
006422|244-en|en|mp3/p244_291.mp3|||None of the agencies was able to help.|
006423|244-en|en|mp3/p244_292.mp3|||I didn't see the point.|
006424|244-en|en|mp3/p244_293.mp3|||This idea has been around for four years.|
006425|244-en|en|mp3/p244_294.mp3|||We are in a war.|
006426|244-en|en|mp3/p244_295.mp3|||Do you think we are a top nation ?|
006427|244-en|en|mp3/p244_296.mp3|||Is our children learning ?|
006428|244-en|en|mp3/p244_297.mp3|||How independent is that ?|
006429|244-en|en|mp3/p244_298.mp3|||What form did that take ?|
006430|244-en|en|mp3/p244_299.mp3|||Are they free ?|
006431|244-en|en|mp3/p244_300.mp3|||Scotland won by six wickets.|
006432|244-en|en|mp3/p244_301.mp3|||However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.|
006433|244-en|en|mp3/p244_302.mp3|||This is a historic agreement.|
006434|244-en|en|mp3/p244_303.mp3|||We have to be realistic.|
006435|244-en|en|mp3/p244_304.mp3|||Every one is a winner.|
006436|244-en|en|mp3/p244_305.mp3|||There was a hole in it.|
006437|244-en|en|mp3/p244_306.mp3|||It will be done in stages.|
006438|244-en|en|mp3/p244_307.mp3|||It all started with a visiting rugby club.|
006439|244-en|en|mp3/p244_308.mp3|||Every character was completely different.|
006440|244-en|en|mp3/p244_309.mp3|||But it is a similar problem.|
006441|244-en|en|mp3/p244_310.mp3|||In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.|
006442|244-en|en|mp3/p244_311.mp3|||But it is important for a number of reasons.|
006443|244-en|en|mp3/p244_312.mp3|||In that moment, I was happy.|
006444|244-en|en|mp3/p244_313.mp3|||All of the management has invested in the firm.|
006445|244-en|en|mp3/p244_314.mp3|||It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.|
006446|244-en|en|mp3/p244_315.mp3|||They were not at the property yesterday.|
006447|244-en|en|mp3/p244_316.mp3|||It involved the same people.|
006448|244-en|en|mp3/p244_317.mp3|||We want to get back into the Champions League.|
006449|244-en|en|mp3/p244_318.mp3|||We have to be very, very careful.|
006450|244-en|en|mp3/p244_319.mp3|||Look at the potential of this club.|
006451|244-en|en|mp3/p244_320.mp3|||Hopefully, this week will be good.|
006452|244-en|en|mp3/p244_321.mp3|||This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.|
006453|244-en|en|mp3/p244_322.mp3|||We did something about it.|
006454|244-en|en|mp3/p244_323.mp3|||But it is up again.|
006455|244-en|en|mp3/p244_324.mp3|||However, the devil is in the detail.|
006456|244-en|en|mp3/p244_325.mp3|||For the moment, however, the position is clear.|
006457|244-en|en|mp3/p244_326.mp3|||The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.|
006458|244-en|en|mp3/p244_327.mp3|||He is already in place.|
006459|244-en|en|mp3/p244_328.mp3|||Another difference is the cost.|
006460|244-en|en|mp3/p244_329.mp3|||Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.|
006461|244-en|en|mp3/p244_330.mp3|||And we can do it.|
006462|244-en|en|mp3/p244_331.mp3|||What are they for ?|
006463|244-en|en|mp3/p244_333.mp3|||Do they think anyone else wants them ?|
006464|244-en|en|mp3/p244_334.mp3|||Tax is a matter for national governments.|
006465|244-en|en|mp3/p244_335.mp3|||And it's a goodbye from him.|
006466|244-en|en|mp3/p244_336.mp3|||It is a sensitive issue.|
006467|244-en|en|mp3/p244_337.mp3|||They have to be addressed.|
006468|244-en|en|mp3/p244_338.mp3|||This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.|
006469|244-en|en|mp3/p244_339.mp3|||Like many companies, it is a problem.|
006470|244-en|en|mp3/p244_340.mp3|||The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.|
006471|244-en|en|mp3/p244_341.mp3|||However, a bid was never made.|
006472|244-en|en|mp3/p244_342.mp3|||That is the lesson of the last three weeks.|
006473|244-en|en|mp3/p244_343.mp3|||Something is going to have to give.|
006474|244-en|en|mp3/p244_344.mp3|||And the context is also completely different.|
006475|244-en|en|mp3/p244_345.mp3|||The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.|
006476|244-en|en|mp3/p244_346.mp3|||The banking sector was weak.|
006477|244-en|en|mp3/p244_347.mp3|||But the New Year was special.|
006478|244-en|en|mp3/p244_348.mp3|||We never played at all.|
006479|244-en|en|mp3/p244_349.mp3|||However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.|
006480|244-en|en|mp3/p244_350.mp3|||This isn't the end of story.|
006481|244-en|en|mp3/p244_351.mp3|||He is a great prospect.|
006482|244-en|en|mp3/p244_352.mp3|||He has been told by the doctor to rest.|
006483|244-en|en|mp3/p244_353.mp3|||However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.|
006484|244-en|en|mp3/p244_354.mp3|||Of course, it does not have to be this way.|
006485|244-en|en|mp3/p244_355.mp3|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
006486|244-en|en|mp3/p244_356.mp3|||However, it does not tell the full story.|
006487|244-en|en|mp3/p244_357.mp3|||They were impressive against France.|
006488|244-en|en|mp3/p244_358.mp3|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
006489|244-en|en|mp3/p244_359.mp3|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
006490|244-en|en|mp3/p244_360.mp3|||It was a test in itself.|
006491|244-en|en|mp3/p244_361.mp3|||Either team will be hard.|
006492|244-en|en|mp3/p244_362.mp3|||The parents will have a great time, too.|
006493|244-en|en|mp3/p244_363.mp3|||At first, the youngster was not keen.|
006494|244-en|en|mp3/p244_364.mp3|||However, it has to be seen as part of a package.|
006495|244-en|en|mp3/p244_365.mp3|||On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.|
006496|244-en|en|mp3/p244_366.mp3|||In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.|
006497|244-en|en|mp3/p244_367.mp3|||Lately, that market has come under pressure.|
006498|244-en|en|mp3/p244_368.mp3|||In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.|
006499|244-en|en|mp3/p244_369.mp3|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
006500|244-en|en|mp3/p244_370.mp3|||The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.|
006501|244-en|en|mp3/p244_371.mp3|||I have a good feeling about this.|
006502|244-en|en|mp3/p244_372.mp3|||The news is not all bad.|
006503|244-en|en|mp3/p244_373.mp3|||Some of the passing was a disgrace.|
006504|244-en|en|mp3/p244_374.mp3|||However, it does not seem to be the case.|
006505|244-en|en|mp3/p244_375.mp3|||It is almost certain to be the last.|
006506|244-en|en|mp3/p244_376.mp3|||You have to be patient.|
006507|244-en|en|mp3/p244_377.mp3|||However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.|
006508|244-en|en|mp3/p244_378.mp3|||I was delighted to accept.|
006509|244-en|en|mp3/p244_379.mp3|||A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.|
006510|244-en|en|mp3/p244_380.mp3|||We are not going to fight in Kosovo.|
006511|244-en|en|mp3/p244_381.mp3|||Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.|

011603|258-en|en|mp3/p258_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
011604|258-en|en|mp3/p258_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
011605|258-en|en|mp3/p258_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
011606|258-en|en|mp3/p258_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
011607|258-en|en|mp3/p258_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
011608|258-en|en|mp3/p258_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
011609|258-en|en|mp3/p258_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

011613|258-en|en|mp3/p258_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
011614|258-en|en|mp3/p258_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
011615|258-en|en|mp3/p258_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
011616|258-en|en|mp3/p258_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
011617|258-en|en|mp3/p258_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
011618|258-en|en|mp3/p258_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
011619|258-en|en|mp3/p258_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
011620|258-en|en|mp3/p258_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

025297|293-en|en|mp3/p293_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

025305|293-en|en|mp3/p293_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025306|293-en|en|mp3/p293_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
025307|293-en|en|mp3/p293_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

025683|294-en|en|mp3/p294_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
025684|294-en|en|mp3/p294_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
025685|294-en|en|mp3/p294_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
025686|294-en|en|mp3/p294_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
025687|294-en|en|mp3/p294_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
025688|294-en|en|mp3/p294_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
025689|294-en|en|mp3/p294_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
025690|294-en|en|mp3/p294_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
025691|294-en|en|mp3/p294_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
025692|294-en|en|mp3/p294_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
025693|294-en|en|mp3/p294_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
025694|294-en|en|mp3/p294_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
025695|294-en|en|mp3/p294_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
025696|294-en|en|mp3/p294_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
025697|294-en|en|mp3/p294_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
025698|294-en|en|mp3/p294_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
025699|294-en|en|mp3/p294_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
025700|294-en|en|mp3/p294_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
025701|294-en|en|mp3/p294_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
025702|294-en|en|mp3/p294_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
025703|294-en|en|mp3/p294_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
025704|294-en|en|mp3/p294_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
025705|294-en|en|mp3/p294_025.mp3|||They were the better team on the night.|
025706|294-en|en|mp3/p294_026.mp3|||The show is sold out, like the others in the run.|
025707|294-en|en|mp3/p294_027.mp3|||It means we have to have some patience.|
025708|294-en|en|mp3/p294_028.mp3|||For the moment, our position remains the same.|
025709|294-en|en|mp3/p294_029.mp3|||I was pregnant and very worried.|

025714|294-en|en|mp3/p294_034.mp3|||Other people had looked at it.|
025715|294-en|en|mp3/p294_035.mp3|||A neighbour said the street was shocked.|
025716|294-en|en|mp3/p294_036.mp3|||Michael, he is running!|
025717|294-en|en|mp3/p294_037.mp3|||He was taken to hospital, but later died.|
025718|294-en|en|mp3/p294_038.mp3|||Their ambition is to go back.|
025719|294-en|en|mp3/p294_039.mp3|||He got the same story.|
025720|294-en|en|mp3/p294_040.mp3|||My view has now changed completely.|
025721|294-en|en|mp3/p294_041.mp3|||I've been dying for an hour.|
025722|294-en|en|mp3/p294_042.mp3|||It wasn't a flight of fancy.|
025723|294-en|en|mp3/p294_043.mp3|||We're playing away from home and that's it.|
025724|294-en|en|mp3/p294_044.mp3|||I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.|
025725|294-en|en|mp3/p294_045.mp3|||They tend to be female and retired.|

025727|294-en|en|mp3/p294_047.mp3|||This was no accident.|

025729|294-en|en|mp3/p294_049.mp3|||We've all done it!|
025730|294-en|en|mp3/p294_050.mp3|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
025731|294-en|en|mp3/p294_051.mp3|||Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.|
025732|294-en|en|mp3/p294_052.mp3|||The course record was in his name.|
025733|294-en|en|mp3/p294_053.mp3|||But we welcome this document.|
025734|294-en|en|mp3/p294_054.mp3|||What is the point of jailing him?|
025735|294-en|en|mp3/p294_055.mp3|||We should not bring him into a dispute.|
025736|294-en|en|mp3/p294_056.mp3|||This is a possible way forward.|
025737|294-en|en|mp3/p294_057.mp3|||I am not here to get even.|

025751|294-en|en|mp3/p294_071.mp3|||It took about five or six hours.|
025752|294-en|en|mp3/p294_072.mp3|||I found the course inspiring.|
025753|294-en|en|mp3/p294_073.mp3|||Two things were clear from the new programme.|
025754|294-en|en|mp3/p294_074.mp3|||This is the real thing now.|

025763|294-en|en|mp3/p294_083.mp3|||That was enough for the committee.|
025764|294-en|en|mp3/p294_084.mp3|||It is a very genuine prospect.|
025765|294-en|en|mp3/p294_085.mp3|||It is the tip of the iceberg.|
025766|294-en|en|mp3/p294_086.mp3|||We have to focus on what is important.|

025773|294-en|en|mp3/p294_093.mp3|||But now it's back to golf.|

025779|294-en|en|mp3/p294_099.mp3|||So is that it, then?|
025780|294-en|en|mp3/p294_100.mp3|||You should have let it write the cards.|

025790|294-en|en|mp3/p294_110.mp3|||This has gone on too long.|

025803|294-en|en|mp3/p294_123.mp3|||He seems to be used to the attention.|
025804|294-en|en|mp3/p294_124.mp3|||It's an hour of the same response.|
025805|294-en|en|mp3/p294_125.mp3|||We have very real concerns about it.|
025806|294-en|en|mp3/p294_126.mp3|||He has gone through the process before.|

026079|294-en|en|mp3/p294_400.mp3|||Of course, it doesn't all come off.|
026080|294-en|en|mp3/p294_401.mp3|||In fact, he should never have been in the field.|

026110|295-en|en|mp3/p295_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
026111|295-en|en|mp3/p295_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
026112|295-en|en|mp3/p295_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
026113|295-en|en|mp3/p295_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
026114|295-en|en|mp3/p295_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|

026116|295-en|en|mp3/p295_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

026123|295-en|en|mp3/p295_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
026124|295-en|en|mp3/p295_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|

028167|301-en|en|mp3/p301_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
028168|301-en|en|mp3/p301_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
028169|301-en|en|mp3/p301_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

028564|302-en|en|mp3/p302_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
028565|302-en|en|mp3/p302_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

028567|302-en|en|mp3/p302_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
028568|302-en|en|mp3/p302_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
028569|302-en|en|mp3/p302_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|

028577|302-en|en|mp3/p302_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.|

029242|304-en|en|mp3/p304_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
029243|304-en|en|mp3/p304_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

029650|305-en|en|mp3/p305_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|

032824|313-en|en|mp3/p313_302.mp3|||I can feel the sound inside.|
032825|313-en|en|mp3/p313_303.mp3|||I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.|

032864|313-en|en|mp3/p313_344.mp3|||It's a question of perception.|
032865|313-en|en|mp3/p313_345.mp3|||Staff have been informed.|

032901|313-en|en|mp3/p313_381.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
032902|313-en|en|mp3/p313_382.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
032903|313-en|en|mp3/p313_383.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
032904|313-en|en|mp3/p313_384.mp3|||We have been preparing all year.|
032905|313-en|en|mp3/p313_385.mp3|||We could learn a lot from them.|

032910|313-en|en|mp3/p313_390.mp3|||I may think about performing it.|
032911|313-en|en|mp3/p313_391.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|

032917|313-en|en|mp3/p313_397.mp3|||Instead, it's back to the drawing board.|
032918|313-en|en|mp3/p313_398.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
032919|313-en|en|mp3/p313_399.mp3|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
032920|313-en|en|mp3/p313_400.mp3|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
032921|313-en|en|mp3/p313_401.mp3|||I found that much more challenging.|

032923|313-en|en|mp3/p313_403.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|

032936|313-en|en|mp3/p313_416.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
032937|313-en|en|mp3/p313_417.mp3|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
032938|313-en|en|mp3/p313_418.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
032939|313-en|en|mp3/p313_419.mp3|||I didn't play all that well.|
032940|313-en|en|mp3/p313_420.mp3|||Who can tell?|
032941|313-en|en|mp3/p313_421.mp3|||It appears to have been closed down.|

032947|314-en|en|mp3/p314_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
032948|314-en|en|mp3/p314_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
032949|314-en|en|mp3/p314_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
032950|314-en|en|mp3/p314_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
032951|314-en|en|mp3/p314_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
032952|314-en|en|mp3/p314_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
032953|314-en|en|mp3/p314_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
032954|314-en|en|mp3/p314_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
032955|314-en|en|mp3/p314_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
032956|314-en|en|mp3/p314_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
032957|314-en|en|mp3/p314_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
032958|314-en|en|mp3/p314_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
032959|314-en|en|mp3/p314_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
032960|314-en|en|mp3/p314_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
032961|314-en|en|mp3/p314_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
032962|314-en|en|mp3/p314_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
032963|314-en|en|mp3/p314_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
032964|314-en|en|mp3/p314_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
032965|314-en|en|mp3/p314_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
032966|314-en|en|mp3/p314_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
032967|314-en|en|mp3/p314_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
032968|314-en|en|mp3/p314_025.mp3|||The Scots are, however, in good company.|

033365|314-en|en|mp3/p314_422.mp3|||Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.|
033366|314-en|en|mp3/p314_423.mp3|||How come it is so often unnoticed?|
033367|316-en|en|mp3/p316_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
033368|316-en|en|mp3/p316_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
033369|316-en|en|mp3/p316_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
033370|316-en|en|mp3/p316_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
033371|316-en|en|mp3/p316_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
033372|316-en|en|mp3/p316_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
033373|316-en|en|mp3/p316_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
033374|316-en|en|mp3/p316_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
033375|316-en|en|mp3/p316_009.mp3|||There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
033376|316-en|en|mp3/p316_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
033377|316-en|en|mp3/p316_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
033378|316-en|en|mp3/p316_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
033379|316-en|en|mp3/p316_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
033380|316-en|en|mp3/p316_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
033381|316-en|en|mp3/p316_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
033382|316-en|en|mp3/p316_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.|
033383|316-en|en|mp3/p316_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
033384|316-en|en|mp3/p316_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
033385|316-en|en|mp3/p316_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
033386|316-en|en|mp3/p316_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
033387|316-en|en|mp3/p316_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.|
033388|316-en|en|mp3/p316_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
033389|316-en|en|mp3/p316_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
033390|316-en|en|mp3/p316_025.mp3|||We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.|

033394|316-en|en|mp3/p316_029.mp3|||We have worked hard.|
033395|316-en|en|mp3/p316_030.mp3|||After that, it's a step into the unknown.|

033407|316-en|en|mp3/p316_042.mp3|||I accept that, but is very upsetting.|
033408|316-en|en|mp3/p316_043.mp3|||We accept the challenge.|
033409|316-en|en|mp3/p316_044.mp3|||The question is, Will it be enough?|
033410|316-en|en|mp3/p316_045.mp3|||After that it is up to the boss.|
033411|316-en|en|mp3/p316_046.mp3|||They were taken to prove a point.|
033412|316-en|en|mp3/p316_047.mp3|||It doesn't have to be in Inverness.|
033413|316-en|en|mp3/p316_048.mp3|||And they removed a Borderer.|
033414|316-en|en|mp3/p316_049.mp3|||So, why does he do it?|
033415|316-en|en|mp3/p316_050.mp3|||I would love to have him home.|
033416|316-en|en|mp3/p316_051.mp3|||It is very unfair, and something should be done.|
033417|316-en|en|mp3/p316_052.mp3|||He had no enemies.|
033418|316-en|en|mp3/p316_053.mp3|||That is not the case this time.|

033420|316-en|en|mp3/p316_055.mp3|||But the law is very clear on this.|
033421|316-en|en|mp3/p316_056.mp3|||They treated me with respect and courtesy.|
033422|316-en|en|mp3/p316_057.mp3|||There was only silence.|
033423|316-en|en|mp3/p316_058.mp3|||However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.|
033424|316-en|en|mp3/p316_059.mp3|||It doesn't look as pretty.|
033425|316-en|en|mp3/p316_060.mp3|||However, our players will fight for that.|
033426|316-en|en|mp3/p316_061.mp3|||Everyone was very saddened.|

033437|316-en|en|mp3/p316_072.mp3|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
033438|316-en|en|mp3/p316_073.mp3|||He was also a great man.|

033450|316-en|en|mp3/p316_085.mp3|||It is, after all, a very funny play.|

033452|316-en|en|mp3/p316_087.mp3|||He was caught and fired.|

034215|318-en|en|mp3/p318_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034216|318-en|en|mp3/p318_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

034219|318-en|en|mp3/p318_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034220|318-en|en|mp3/p318_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034221|318-en|en|mp3/p318_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

034226|318-en|en|mp3/p318_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

034228|318-en|en|mp3/p318_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034229|318-en|en|mp3/p318_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034230|318-en|en|mp3/p318_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034231|318-en|en|mp3/p318_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
034232|318-en|en|mp3/p318_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

034550|318-en|en|mp3/p318_342.mp3|||When it comes down to it, this is a job.|
034551|318-en|en|mp3/p318_343.mp3|||It's no less intriguing, however.|
034552|318-en|en|mp3/p318_344.mp3|||It's a question of perception.|
034553|318-en|en|mp3/p318_345.mp3|||Staff have been informed.|

034557|318-en|en|mp3/p318_349.mp3|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
034558|318-en|en|mp3/p318_350.mp3|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
034559|318-en|en|mp3/p318_351.mp3|||That might help a bit.|

034571|318-en|en|mp3/p318_363.mp3|||This is an internal matter.|
034572|318-en|en|mp3/p318_364.mp3|||I am amazed at what he's done.|
034573|318-en|en|mp3/p318_365.mp3|||They took a risk.|
034574|318-en|en|mp3/p318_366.mp3|||The idea was presented to me.|

034588|318-en|en|mp3/p318_380.mp3|||They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.|
034589|318-en|en|mp3/p318_381.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
034590|318-en|en|mp3/p318_382.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
034591|318-en|en|mp3/p318_383.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
034592|318-en|en|mp3/p318_384.mp3|||We have been preparing all year.|
034593|318-en|en|mp3/p318_385.mp3|||We could learn a lot from them.|
034594|318-en|en|mp3/p318_386.mp3|||I can't wait for the outdoors.|
034595|318-en|en|mp3/p318_387.mp3|||Sure, we have problems.|

034597|318-en|en|mp3/p318_389.mp3|||That time is not far away.|
034598|318-en|en|mp3/p318_390.mp3|||I may think about performing it.|
034599|318-en|en|mp3/p318_391.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
034600|318-en|en|mp3/p318_392.mp3|||We also enjoyed a lot of support.|
034601|318-en|en|mp3/p318_393.mp3|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
034602|318-en|en|mp3/p318_394.mp3|||You can't go back and change things.|

034604|318-en|en|mp3/p318_396.mp3|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
034605|318-en|en|mp3/p318_397.mp3|||Instead, it is back to the drawing board.|
034606|318-en|en|mp3/p318_398.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
034607|318-en|en|mp3/p318_399.mp3|||Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.|
034608|318-en|en|mp3/p318_400.mp3|||His primary residence is Scotland.|
034609|318-en|en|mp3/p318_401.mp3|||I found that much more challenging.|
034610|318-en|en|mp3/p318_402.mp3|||This fight is not going to go away.|
034611|318-en|en|mp3/p318_403.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|
034612|318-en|en|mp3/p318_404.mp3|||I will never manage another Scottish club.|
034613|318-en|en|mp3/p318_405.mp3|||The Open champion is back.|
034614|318-en|en|mp3/p318_406.mp3|||It's going to be a new challenge.|
034615|318-en|en|mp3/p318_407.mp3|||As, indeed, they would be.|
034616|318-en|en|mp3/p318_408.mp3|||I want to keep him.|
034617|318-en|en|mp3/p318_409.mp3|||He deserves a top team.|

034619|318-en|en|mp3/p318_411.mp3|||The next eight weeks are critical to us.|
034620|318-en|en|mp3/p318_412.mp3|||Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.|
034621|318-en|en|mp3/p318_413.mp3|||Her grand-daughter was uninjured.|
034622|318-en|en|mp3/p318_414.mp3|||We never agreed to it.|
034623|318-en|en|mp3/p318_415.mp3|||But that night they killed her housekeeper.|
034624|318-en|en|mp3/p318_416.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
034625|318-en|en|mp3/p318_417.mp3|||Sightings were replaced by rumours.|
034626|318-en|en|mp3/p318_418.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
034627|318-en|en|mp3/p318_419.mp3|||I didn't play all that well.|
034628|318-en|en|mp3/p318_420.mp3|||Who can tell?|
034629|318-en|en|mp3/p318_421.mp3|||It appears to have been closed down.|
034630|318-en|en|mp3/p318_422.mp3|||Now, that is a good deal.|
034631|318-en|en|mp3/p318_423.mp3|||The whole nation will be delighted.|
034632|318-en|en|mp3/p318_424.mp3|||We have no plans for direct action.|
034633|323-en|en|mp3/p323_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
034634|323-en|en|mp3/p323_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
034635|323-en|en|mp3/p323_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
034636|323-en|en|mp3/p323_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
034637|323-en|en|mp3/p323_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
034638|323-en|en|mp3/p323_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
034639|323-en|en|mp3/p323_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
034640|323-en|en|mp3/p323_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
034641|323-en|en|mp3/p323_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
034642|323-en|en|mp3/p323_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
034643|323-en|en|mp3/p323_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
034644|323-en|en|mp3/p323_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
034645|323-en|en|mp3/p323_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
034646|323-en|en|mp3/p323_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
034647|323-en|en|mp3/p323_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
034648|323-en|en|mp3/p323_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
034649|323-en|en|mp3/p323_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
034650|323-en|en|mp3/p323_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
034651|323-en|en|mp3/p323_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
034652|323-en|en|mp3/p323_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
034653|323-en|en|mp3/p323_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
034654|323-en|en|mp3/p323_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
034655|323-en|en|mp3/p323_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
034656|323-en|en|mp3/p323_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
034657|323-en|en|mp3/p323_025.mp3|||We've made a couple of albums.|
034658|323-en|en|mp3/p323_026.mp3|||Film music was never the same again.|
034659|323-en|en|mp3/p323_027.mp3|||It was a deeply moving musical experience.|
034660|323-en|en|mp3/p323_028.mp3|||Now it is much easier.|
034661|323-en|en|mp3/p323_029.mp3|||However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.|
034662|323-en|en|mp3/p323_030.mp3|||This is the best way to do it.|
034663|323-en|en|mp3/p323_031.mp3|||Its role is not to interfere.|
034664|323-en|en|mp3/p323_032.mp3|||Leisure centres were also affected.|
034665|323-en|en|mp3/p323_033.mp3|||Something happened on that island.|

034669|323-en|en|mp3/p323_037.mp3|||They discussed how he might get involved.|
034670|323-en|en|mp3/p323_038.mp3|||And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.|
034671|323-en|en|mp3/p323_039.mp3|||And it had two seats.|
034672|323-en|en|mp3/p323_040.mp3|||They were not up to speed.|
034673|323-en|en|mp3/p323_041.mp3|||We know the quality of life goes up.|
034674|323-en|en|mp3/p323_042.mp3|||What is next?|
034675|323-en|en|mp3/p323_043.mp3|||Now they have found out the truth.|
034676|323-en|en|mp3/p323_044.mp3|||We've still got a say in this.|
034677|323-en|en|mp3/p323_045.mp3|||The first was excluding Sinn Fein.|

034682|323-en|en|mp3/p323_050.mp3|||We have been let down by these people.|
034683|323-en|en|mp3/p323_051.mp3|||What's it for?|
034684|323-en|en|mp3/p323_052.mp3|||Nor does he have any desire to be.|
034685|323-en|en|mp3/p323_053.mp3|||How well did they get on?|
034686|323-en|en|mp3/p323_054.mp3|||I don't think it is a drawback.|
034687|323-en|en|mp3/p323_055.mp3|||He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.|
034688|323-en|en|mp3/p323_056.mp3|||They may have been murdered.|
034689|323-en|en|mp3/p323_057.mp3|||However this weekend it will be different.|
034690|323-en|en|mp3/p323_058.mp3|||We didn't try hard enough, that is all.|
034691|323-en|en|mp3/p323_059.mp3|||It also condemned the suicide bombers.|
034692|323-en|en|mp3/p323_060.mp3|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
034693|323-en|en|mp3/p323_061.mp3|||It is very difficult.|

034696|323-en|en|mp3/p323_064.mp3|||Then they killed another three.|
034697|323-en|en|mp3/p323_065.mp3|||What the Department of Transport will make clear.|
034698|323-en|en|mp3/p323_066.mp3|||The six others were injured.|
034699|323-en|en|mp3/p323_067.mp3|||Most of the others were in their twenties.|
034700|323-en|en|mp3/p323_068.mp3|||We were beaten by the better team today.|

034703|323-en|en|mp3/p323_071.mp3|||The law has got to be upheld.|
034704|323-en|en|mp3/p323_072.mp3|||Advice and counselling will be offered.|

036730|334-en|en|mp3/p334_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
036731|334-en|en|mp3/p334_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

036735|334-en|en|mp3/p334_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
036736|334-en|en|mp3/p334_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

036740|334-en|en|mp3/p334_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
036741|334-en|en|mp3/p334_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

036743|334-en|en|mp3/p334_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
036744|334-en|en|mp3/p334_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
036745|334-en|en|mp3/p334_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
036746|334-en|en|mp3/p334_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

037999|339-en|en|mp3/p339_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

038009|339-en|en|mp3/p339_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
038010|339-en|en|mp3/p339_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

038197|339-en|en|mp3/p339_212.mp3|||If that's the case, he will struggle.|
038198|339-en|en|mp3/p339_213.mp3|||It has certainly paid off for him.|
038199|339-en|en|mp3/p339_214.mp3|||We're not getting involved.|
038200|339-en|en|mp3/p339_215.mp3|||The lottery has helped.|

038205|339-en|en|mp3/p339_220.mp3|||However, he added there were signs of progress.|
038206|339-en|en|mp3/p339_221.mp3|||You cannot do that in a lobby.|
038207|339-en|en|mp3/p339_222.mp3|||We will all suffer as a result.|
038208|339-en|en|mp3/p339_223.mp3|||Without doubt, they can win the title.|
038209|339-en|en|mp3/p339_224.mp3|||What's it about?|
038210|339-en|en|mp3/p339_225.mp3|||We are looking to the future.|
038211|339-en|en|mp3/p339_226.mp3|||The signs are positive.|
038212|339-en|en|mp3/p339_227.mp3|||I called it right.|
038213|339-en|en|mp3/p339_228.mp3|||I see it as my job.|
038214|339-en|en|mp3/p339_229.mp3|||I have always believed in myself.|
038215|339-en|en|mp3/p339_230.mp3|||It has to be put in context.|
038216|339-en|en|mp3/p339_231.mp3|||I think we can get there.|
038217|339-en|en|mp3/p339_232.mp3|||I think the Scottish bid is very strong.|
038218|339-en|en|mp3/p339_233.mp3|||No, they have played well.|
038219|339-en|en|mp3/p339_234.mp3|||The reaction of staff has been fantastic.|
038220|339-en|en|mp3/p339_235.mp3|||The answer is obviously no.|
038221|339-en|en|mp3/p339_236.mp3|||I'll take it as it comes.|
038222|339-en|en|mp3/p339_237.mp3|||I think we're the better side.|
038223|339-en|en|mp3/p339_238.mp3|||We act because we must.|

038227|339-en|en|mp3/p339_242.mp3|||We didn't get the supply to the forwards.|
038228|339-en|en|mp3/p339_243.mp3|||I could have been killed on that day.|
038229|339-en|en|mp3/p339_244.mp3|||They have to come up with a solution.|
038230|339-en|en|mp3/p339_245.mp3|||It is very enjoyable.|
038231|339-en|en|mp3/p339_246.mp3|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
038232|339-en|en|mp3/p339_247.mp3|||Did it work?|
038233|339-en|en|mp3/p339_248.mp3|||But that is for another day.|
038234|339-en|en|mp3/p339_249.mp3|||There is a great carry over value.|
038235|339-en|en|mp3/p339_250.mp3|||It was not like that at all.|
038236|339-en|en|mp3/p339_251.mp3|||Police are appealing for witnesses.|
038237|339-en|en|mp3/p339_252.mp3|||I was very surprised.|
038238|339-en|en|mp3/p339_253.mp3|||We all knew they could do it.|
038239|339-en|en|mp3/p339_254.mp3|||It's about taking risks.|
038240|339-en|en|mp3/p339_255.mp3|||Why is this?|
038241|339-en|en|mp3/p339_256.mp3|||He is due in Israel tomorrow.|
038242|339-en|en|mp3/p339_257.mp3|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
038243|339-en|en|mp3/p339_258.mp3|||There are not too many like him.|
038244|339-en|en|mp3/p339_259.mp3|||The memory is there.|
038245|339-en|en|mp3/p339_260.mp3|||It was an amazing experience.|
038246|339-en|en|mp3/p339_261.mp3|||Nobody has been put on trial.|
038247|339-en|en|mp3/p339_262.mp3|||He will go on the bench.|
038248|339-en|en|mp3/p339_263.mp3|||The police are hopeless.|
038249|339-en|en|mp3/p339_264.mp3|||There are no plans to change this.|
038250|339-en|en|mp3/p339_265.mp3|||We are deeply concerned at the announcement.|
038251|339-en|en|mp3/p339_266.mp3|||A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.|
038252|339-en|en|mp3/p339_267.mp3|||That's the important thing.|
038253|339-en|en|mp3/p339_268.mp3|||Should he resign?|
038254|339-en|en|mp3/p339_269.mp3|||They have to live with the risk.|
038255|339-en|en|mp3/p339_270.mp3|||It is, but that's not the point.|
038256|339-en|en|mp3/p339_271.mp3|||It was my whole life.|
038257|339-en|en|mp3/p339_272.mp3|||It was a classic.|
038258|339-en|en|mp3/p339_273.mp3|||This week is a perfect example.|
038259|339-en|en|mp3/p339_274.mp3|||However, it is going to happen.|
038260|339-en|en|mp3/p339_275.mp3|||This time it really could happen.|
038261|339-en|en|mp3/p339_276.mp3|||That sort of thing is long gone.|
038262|339-en|en|mp3/p339_277.mp3|||That includes the equipment?|
038263|339-en|en|mp3/p339_278.mp3|||It does nothing for me.|
038264|339-en|en|mp3/p339_279.mp3|||That has been lost.|
038265|339-en|en|mp3/p339_280.mp3|||But that's another story.|
038266|339-en|en|mp3/p339_281.mp3|||I think it has worked.|
038267|339-en|en|mp3/p339_282.mp3|||No other family members could be contacted.|
038268|339-en|en|mp3/p339_283.mp3|||There is nothing to be gained from that.|
038269|339-en|en|mp3/p339_284.mp3|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
038270|339-en|en|mp3/p339_285.mp3|||But do not rely on it.|
038271|339-en|en|mp3/p339_286.mp3|||I made a mistake.|
038272|339-en|en|mp3/p339_287.mp3|||What do you want.|
038273|339-en|en|mp3/p339_288.mp3|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
038274|339-en|en|mp3/p339_289.mp3|||I think we could do well in Europe.|
038275|339-en|en|mp3/p339_290.mp3|||And yet, there has been no great impact.|
038276|339-en|en|mp3/p339_291.mp3|||Was that not awful?|
038277|339-en|en|mp3/p339_292.mp3|||Yesterday was a statement of intent.|
038278|339-en|en|mp3/p339_293.mp3|||I'm not there yet but it is close.|
038279|339-en|en|mp3/p339_294.mp3|||But it will not work again.|
038280|339-en|en|mp3/p339_295.mp3|||Even then he wanted to deflect attention.|
038281|339-en|en|mp3/p339_296.mp3|||I have nothing to say on that.|
038282|339-en|en|mp3/p339_297.mp3|||The rest is his own.|
038283|339-en|en|mp3/p339_298.mp3|||I have no worry about that.|
038284|339-en|en|mp3/p339_299.mp3|||There has been a fair bit in between, too.|
038285|339-en|en|mp3/p339_300.mp3|||Who was on the panel?|
038286|339-en|en|mp3/p339_301.mp3|||It turned out to have been three hours.|
038287|339-en|en|mp3/p339_302.mp3|||That is exactly right.|
038288|339-en|en|mp3/p339_303.mp3|||That is not good for golf!|
038289|339-en|en|mp3/p339_304.mp3|||He had planned to sell it.|
038290|339-en|en|mp3/p339_305.mp3|||We know the goals will come.|
038291|339-en|en|mp3/p339_306.mp3|||But it did not last.|
038292|339-en|en|mp3/p339_307.mp3|||They need to look after themselves.|
038293|339-en|en|mp3/p339_308.mp3|||They will be stopped, and they will be punished.|
038294|339-en|en|mp3/p339_309.mp3|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
038295|339-en|en|mp3/p339_310.mp3|||We have nothing to lose.|
038296|339-en|en|mp3/p339_311.mp3|||The first time it was rejected.|
038297|339-en|en|mp3/p339_312.mp3|||He did not report it.|
038298|339-en|en|mp3/p339_313.mp3|||No-one can take it in.|
038299|339-en|en|mp3/p339_314.mp3|||They were following his orders.|
038300|339-en|en|mp3/p339_315.mp3|||That is an entirely different discipline.|
038301|339-en|en|mp3/p339_316.mp3|||It was an insult.|
038302|339-en|en|mp3/p339_317.mp3|||Yet there is hope.|
038303|339-en|en|mp3/p339_318.mp3|||Referees in Scotland are very weak.|
038304|339-en|en|mp3/p339_319.mp3|||It will not be easy for him.|
038305|339-en|en|mp3/p339_320.mp3|||That was a fairy tale.|
038306|339-en|en|mp3/p339_321.mp3|||I would love to do that.|
038307|339-en|en|mp3/p339_322.mp3|||You'll have to wait and see.|
038308|339-en|en|mp3/p339_323.mp3|||It wasn't the issue.|
038309|339-en|en|mp3/p339_324.mp3|||The number never came.|
038310|339-en|en|mp3/p339_325.mp3|||I really have to go now.|
038311|339-en|en|mp3/p339_326.mp3|||We are going to listen to Britain.|
038312|339-en|en|mp3/p339_327.mp3|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
038313|339-en|en|mp3/p339_328.mp3|||Words are not enough.|
038314|339-en|en|mp3/p339_329.mp3|||He is in charge on the pitch.|
038315|339-en|en|mp3/p339_330.mp3|||We have expected it.|
038316|339-en|en|mp3/p339_331.mp3|||Mr Blair was ready for him.|
038317|339-en|en|mp3/p339_332.mp3|||Well, that was the plan.|
038318|339-en|en|mp3/p339_333.mp3|||The problem is fairly serious.|
038319|339-en|en|mp3/p339_334.mp3|||No decisions have been taken.|
038320|339-en|en|mp3/p339_335.mp3|||We won't do that.|
038321|339-en|en|mp3/p339_336.mp3|||It's the body that counts.|
038322|339-en|en|mp3/p339_337.mp3|||Sprinters are not fit.|
038323|339-en|en|mp3/p339_338.mp3|||This has been coming for weeks and weeks.|
038324|339-en|en|mp3/p339_339.mp3|||It's a double whammy.|
038325|339-en|en|mp3/p339_340.mp3|||Charges against the pair were found not proven.|
038326|339-en|en|mp3/p339_341.mp3|||Let's not make that mistake again.|
038327|339-en|en|mp3/p339_342.mp3|||That's why he is the prime minister.|
038328|339-en|en|mp3/p339_343.mp3|||Only injury has prevented that happening before.|
038329|339-en|en|mp3/p339_344.mp3|||They have to be dealt with.|
038330|339-en|en|mp3/p339_345.mp3|||His manager blamed the referee.|
038331|339-en|en|mp3/p339_346.mp3|||So what was he really doing?|
038332|339-en|en|mp3/p339_347.mp3|||I don't want to go anywhere.|
038333|339-en|en|mp3/p339_348.mp3|||How do we get a bigger stage?|
038334|339-en|en|mp3/p339_349.mp3|||We're very close to being a good team.|
038335|339-en|en|mp3/p339_350.mp3|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
038336|339-en|en|mp3/p339_351.mp3|||That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.|
038337|339-en|en|mp3/p339_352.mp3|||My mind is the most important thing now.|
038338|339-en|en|mp3/p339_353.mp3|||I had nothing to lose.|
038339|339-en|en|mp3/p339_354.mp3|||This is a really serious issue.|
038340|339-en|en|mp3/p339_355.mp3|||I thought to myself.|
038341|339-en|en|mp3/p339_356.mp3|||Could it be?|
038342|339-en|en|mp3/p339_357.mp3|||We're talking to the US.|
038343|339-en|en|mp3/p339_358.mp3|||Thereafter they were again in control.|
038344|339-en|en|mp3/p339_359.mp3|||It looks as though there is no chance.|
038345|339-en|en|mp3/p339_360.mp3|||You have to keep the focus alive.|
038346|339-en|en|mp3/p339_361.mp3|||It could have been a ceilidh.|
038347|339-en|en|mp3/p339_362.mp3|||I cannot really commit.|
038348|339-en|en|mp3/p339_363.mp3|||There are many questions to be answered.|
038349|339-en|en|mp3/p339_364.mp3|||Sadly, so did a couple of errors.|
038350|339-en|en|mp3/p339_365.mp3|||This is a new beginning.|
038351|339-en|en|mp3/p339_366.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
038352|339-en|en|mp3/p339_367.mp3|||They will fight for everything.|
038353|339-en|en|mp3/p339_368.mp3|||He is doing just that.|
038354|339-en|en|mp3/p339_369.mp3|||The night is young.|
038355|339-en|en|mp3/p339_370.mp3|||But there are signs of a revival.|
038356|339-en|en|mp3/p339_371.mp3|||I thought it was a great game.|
038357|339-en|en|mp3/p339_372.mp3|||Just get on with it.|
038358|339-en|en|mp3/p339_373.mp3|||Germany also said it was unimpressed.|
038359|339-en|en|mp3/p339_374.mp3|||It shows the Government is listening.|
038360|339-en|en|mp3/p339_375.mp3|||She's the runner - she makes the decisions.|
038361|339-en|en|mp3/p339_376.mp3|||They want it to work.|
038362|339-en|en|mp3/p339_377.mp3|||This is a completely new experience for me.|
038363|339-en|en|mp3/p339_378.mp3|||They still have a great sense of humour.|
038364|339-en|en|mp3/p339_379.mp3|||It decided to blame the media.|
038365|339-en|en|mp3/p339_380.mp3|||We have chosen for the patients.|
038366|339-en|en|mp3/p339_381.mp3|||He was at the outset of his career.|
038367|339-en|en|mp3/p339_382.mp3|||Our position is quite clear.|
038368|339-en|en|mp3/p339_383.mp3|||It could now be up to the courts.|
038369|339-en|en|mp3/p339_384.mp3|||We can make a difference.|
038370|339-en|en|mp3/p339_385.mp3|||This was not a contest.|
038371|339-en|en|mp3/p339_386.mp3|||So far the weather has been very pleasant.|
038372|339-en|en|mp3/p339_387.mp3|||Breaching that condition was itself an offence.|
038373|339-en|en|mp3/p339_388.mp3|||I cannot describe it.|
038374|339-en|en|mp3/p339_389.mp3|||It is not designed to kill.|
038375|339-en|en|mp3/p339_390.mp3|||He has run a hell of a race.|
038376|339-en|en|mp3/p339_391.mp3|||We'll have to be satisfied with it.|
038377|339-en|en|mp3/p339_392.mp3|||Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.|
038378|339-en|en|mp3/p339_393.mp3|||It is good football in Scotland.|
038379|339-en|en|mp3/p339_394.mp3|||There is no other option.|
038380|339-en|en|mp3/p339_395.mp3|||You can feel the tension in the air.|
038381|339-en|en|mp3/p339_396.mp3|||It is a technique.|
038382|339-en|en|mp3/p339_397.mp3|||Is it the shape of things to come?|
038383|339-en|en|mp3/p339_398.mp3|||My body is exhausted.|
038384|339-en|en|mp3/p339_399.mp3|||It is about more than Scotland.|
038385|339-en|en|mp3/p339_400.mp3|||It's not just going to be busy.|
038386|339-en|en|mp3/p339_401.mp3|||She was on the edge of breaking point.|
038387|339-en|en|mp3/p339_402.mp3|||The first appeared to be successful.|
038388|339-en|en|mp3/p339_403.mp3|||She was so supportive.|
038389|339-en|en|mp3/p339_404.mp3|||I'm delighted with our performance.|
038390|339-en|en|mp3/p339_405.mp3|||We await a decision.|
038391|339-en|en|mp3/p339_406.mp3|||It's a matter of balance.|
038392|339-en|en|mp3/p339_407.mp3|||It is an investment in our product.|

038398|339-en|en|mp3/p339_413.mp3|||I saw it later in the news.|

038416|340-en|en|mp3/p340_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038417|340-en|en|mp3/p340_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
038418|340-en|en|mp3/p340_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
038419|340-en|en|mp3/p340_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038420|340-en|en|mp3/p340_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038421|340-en|en|mp3/p340_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038422|340-en|en|mp3/p340_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
038423|340-en|en|mp3/p340_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

038426|340-en|en|mp3/p340_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.|
038427|340-en|en|mp3/p340_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
038428|340-en|en|mp3/p340_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
038429|340-en|en|mp3/p340_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038430|340-en|en|mp3/p340_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038431|340-en|en|mp3/p340_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038432|340-en|en|mp3/p340_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

038434|340-en|en|mp3/p340_026.mp3|||We are not prepared to do that.|
038435|340-en|en|mp3/p340_027.mp3|||We've just decided to do something about it.|
038436|340-en|en|mp3/p340_028.mp3|||It's a horrific incident.|
038437|340-en|en|mp3/p340_029.mp3|||But it's not just about that.|
038438|340-en|en|mp3/p340_030.mp3|||We've not won anything yet.|

038442|340-en|en|mp3/p340_034.mp3|||Do you think they would do any better?|
038443|340-en|en|mp3/p340_035.mp3|||They were appalling, disgraceful.|
038444|340-en|en|mp3/p340_036.mp3|||Who was that?|

038446|340-en|en|mp3/p340_038.mp3|||This is my personal assessment.|
038447|340-en|en|mp3/p340_039.mp3|||It is a recipe for success.|
038448|340-en|en|mp3/p340_040.mp3|||You've got to have everything inside with you.|
038449|340-en|en|mp3/p340_041.mp3|||We didn't deserve to win.|

038451|340-en|en|mp3/p340_043.mp3|||We can hardly talk about it.|
038452|340-en|en|mp3/p340_044.mp3|||That was a month ago.|
038453|340-en|en|mp3/p340_045.mp3|||I have lost all confidence.|
038454|340-en|en|mp3/p340_046.mp3|||It would be another reason to live.|
038455|340-en|en|mp3/p340_047.mp3|||I felt under a lot of pressure.|
038456|340-en|en|mp3/p340_048.mp3|||None of the pieces was commissioned.|
038457|340-en|en|mp3/p340_049.mp3|||It is somewhere to be.|

038462|340-en|en|mp3/p340_054.mp3|||I certainly think it's very short-sighted.|
038463|340-en|en|mp3/p340_055.mp3|||We did something about it.|
038464|340-en|en|mp3/p340_056.mp3|||Where is the money coming from?|
038465|340-en|en|mp3/p340_057.mp3|||It needs a rethink.|
038466|340-en|en|mp3/p340_058.mp3|||Why does it work?|
038467|340-en|en|mp3/p340_059.mp3|||He would have been wrong.|

038475|340-en|en|mp3/p340_067.mp3|||It's probably just as well.|

038499|340-en|en|mp3/p340_091.mp3|||It could be to do with the location.|
038500|340-en|en|mp3/p340_092.mp3|||This is a terrible tragedy.|

038535|340-en|en|mp3/p340_127.mp3|||This is not the case.|
038536|340-en|en|mp3/p340_128.mp3|||There may be some resistance.|
038537|340-en|en|mp3/p340_129.mp3|||It is the same old story.|

038589|340-en|en|mp3/p340_181.mp3|||And that's it?|
038590|340-en|en|mp3/p340_182.mp3|||I came here this week to work.|
038591|340-en|en|mp3/p340_183.mp3|||We are really good friends.|
038592|340-en|en|mp3/p340_184.mp3|||But that is not an issue for now.|
038593|340-en|en|mp3/p340_185.mp3|||Of course the ending was fantastic.|
038594|340-en|en|mp3/p340_186.mp3|||I want to be frank.|
038595|340-en|en|mp3/p340_187.mp3|||This was an option from the beginning.|
038596|340-en|en|mp3/p340_188.mp3|||Clearly he is keeping in touch.|
038597|340-en|en|mp3/p340_189.mp3|||Yet it seemed to work.|
038598|340-en|en|mp3/p340_190.mp3|||I think it was just a tragic accident.|
038599|340-en|en|mp3/p340_191.mp3|||We haven't been able to go and see.|
038600|340-en|en|mp3/p340_192.mp3|||It works, as well.|
038601|340-en|en|mp3/p340_193.mp3|||I can't say anything.|
038602|340-en|en|mp3/p340_194.mp3|||I would be interested in another attempt.|
038603|340-en|en|mp3/p340_195.mp3|||However, that is a sizeable if.|
038604|340-en|en|mp3/p340_196.mp3|||There is no other way.|
038605|340-en|en|mp3/p340_197.mp3|||This was all well and good.|
038606|340-en|en|mp3/p340_198.mp3|||This is a disaster for us.|
038607|340-en|en|mp3/p340_199.mp3|||What does that mean?|
038608|340-en|en|mp3/p340_200.mp3|||This is your life.|
038609|340-en|en|mp3/p340_201.mp3|||He has seen the past.|
038610|340-en|en|mp3/p340_202.mp3|||He can be beaten.|
038611|340-en|en|mp3/p340_203.mp3|||He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.|
038612|340-en|en|mp3/p340_204.mp3|||Why does he do it?|
038613|340-en|en|mp3/p340_205.mp3|||That's my daughter acting.|
038614|340-en|en|mp3/p340_206.mp3|||They are very clever and very dangerous.|
038615|340-en|en|mp3/p340_207.mp3|||It wouldn't matter if he had.|
038616|340-en|en|mp3/p340_208.mp3|||We lost out a little bit.|
038617|340-en|en|mp3/p340_209.mp3|||Hollywood comedy is having a good week.|
038618|340-en|en|mp3/p340_210.mp3|||I had just taken it off.|
038619|340-en|en|mp3/p340_211.mp3|||The family baton is handed on.|
038620|340-en|en|mp3/p340_212.mp3|||We have to put pressure on Rangers.|
038621|340-en|en|mp3/p340_213.mp3|||It was properly reported to us.|
038622|340-en|en|mp3/p340_214.mp3|||He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.|
038623|340-en|en|mp3/p340_215.mp3|||The seller was not revealed.|
038624|340-en|en|mp3/p340_216.mp3|||Everything happened so quickly.|
038625|340-en|en|mp3/p340_217.mp3|||How can this be?|
038626|340-en|en|mp3/p340_218.mp3|||I am feeling a bit better.|
038627|340-en|en|mp3/p340_219.mp3|||Everyone here is heartbroken.|
038628|340-en|en|mp3/p340_220.mp3|||Not so, it seems.|
038629|340-en|en|mp3/p340_221.mp3|||He was also a great man.|
038630|340-en|en|mp3/p340_222.mp3|||We have no further comment to make.|
038631|340-en|en|mp3/p340_223.mp3|||This produces exactly the opposite effect.|
038632|340-en|en|mp3/p340_224.mp3|||Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.|
038633|340-en|en|mp3/p340_225.mp3|||You have to keep it on the fairways.|
038634|340-en|en|mp3/p340_226.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCormick.|
038635|340-en|en|mp3/p340_227.mp3|||So there, we won.|
038636|340-en|en|mp3/p340_228.mp3|||I don't like to fail.|
038637|340-en|en|mp3/p340_229.mp3|||I really didn't think he would.|
038638|340-en|en|mp3/p340_230.mp3|||He may have a long wait.|
038639|340-en|en|mp3/p340_231.mp3|||They have already done that.|
038640|340-en|en|mp3/p340_232.mp3|||Later, a very different story emerged.|
038641|340-en|en|mp3/p340_233.mp3|||So it should be.|
038642|340-en|en|mp3/p340_234.mp3|||They didn't find any substance.|
038643|340-en|en|mp3/p340_235.mp3|||It's hard to say.|
038644|340-en|en|mp3/p340_236.mp3|||Her heart was not in it.|
038645|340-en|en|mp3/p340_237.mp3|||After all, he is the King of Scotland.|
038646|340-en|en|mp3/p340_238.mp3|||Is there any prospect of this happening?|
038647|340-en|en|mp3/p340_239.mp3|||They are now collapsing.|
038648|340-en|en|mp3/p340_240.mp3|||He had been surprised by the local reaction.|
038649|340-en|en|mp3/p340_241.mp3|||Government funding is not a problem.|
038650|340-en|en|mp3/p340_242.mp3|||I'm still an amateur in that sense.|
038651|340-en|en|mp3/p340_243.mp3|||We just did not want to believe it.|
038652|340-en|en|mp3/p340_244.mp3|||The medal itself is not that important.|
038653|340-en|en|mp3/p340_245.mp3|||I should think so, too.|
038654|340-en|en|mp3/p340_246.mp3|||The time for change is now.|
038655|340-en|en|mp3/p340_247.mp3|||They deserved to beat us in the replay.|
038656|340-en|en|mp3/p340_248.mp3|||Can they be serious?|
038657|340-en|en|mp3/p340_249.mp3|||We've got to get this right.|
038658|340-en|en|mp3/p340_250.mp3|||The film was great.|
038659|340-en|en|mp3/p340_251.mp3|||I'm just enjoying every match.|
038660|340-en|en|mp3/p340_252.mp3|||They set up to win the hole.|
038661|340-en|en|mp3/p340_253.mp3|||I am not a liar.|
038662|340-en|en|mp3/p340_254.mp3|||Let's make this clear.|
038663|340-en|en|mp3/p340_255.mp3|||We also hope to meet the men.|
038664|340-en|en|mp3/p340_256.mp3|||It was quite simply, delicious.|
038665|340-en|en|mp3/p340_257.mp3|||I can't believe it happened.|
038666|340-en|en|mp3/p340_258.mp3|||Thankfully it was cleared up.|
038667|340-en|en|mp3/p340_259.mp3|||The game will be at a football stadium.|
038668|340-en|en|mp3/p340_260.mp3|||They were his words.|
038669|340-en|en|mp3/p340_261.mp3|||Shelter also supports the reform.|
038670|340-en|en|mp3/p340_262.mp3|||The attack was totally out of the blue.|
038671|340-en|en|mp3/p340_263.mp3|||People were very confused.|
038672|340-en|en|mp3/p340_264.mp3|||We've had a lot of adjusting to do.|
038673|340-en|en|mp3/p340_265.mp3|||I am very relieved.|
038674|340-en|en|mp3/p340_266.mp3|||The people have been really friendly.|
038675|340-en|en|mp3/p340_267.mp3|||It was bound to happen, and it has happened.|
038676|340-en|en|mp3/p340_268.mp3|||Aberdeen were difficult to break down.|
038677|340-en|en|mp3/p340_269.mp3|||That, though, is not true.|
038678|340-en|en|mp3/p340_270.mp3|||I hope he comes back.|
038679|340-en|en|mp3/p340_271.mp3|||They made up for it on Saturday.|
038680|340-en|en|mp3/p340_272.mp3|||That was our mission.|
038681|340-en|en|mp3/p340_273.mp3|||I am delighted for them.|
038682|340-en|en|mp3/p340_274.mp3|||The second half was a different affair.|
038683|340-en|en|mp3/p340_275.mp3|||The scheme has been funded by the Government.|
038684|340-en|en|mp3/p340_276.mp3|||They might be surprised by the response.|
038685|340-en|en|mp3/p340_277.mp3|||I've done it all.|
038686|340-en|en|mp3/p340_278.mp3|||We have worked well with them for years.|
038687|340-en|en|mp3/p340_279.mp3|||They've had a good start as well.|
038688|340-en|en|mp3/p340_280.mp3|||The director's a genius.|
038689|340-en|en|mp3/p340_281.mp3|||One thing is clear.|
038690|340-en|en|mp3/p340_282.mp3|||We might never see him again.|
038691|340-en|en|mp3/p340_283.mp3|||Such as it is.|
038692|340-en|en|mp3/p340_284.mp3|||The car was just there.|
038693|340-en|en|mp3/p340_285.mp3|||They were very unfair to him.|
038694|340-en|en|mp3/p340_286.mp3|||I have spoken to my brother.|
038695|340-en|en|mp3/p340_287.mp3|||And that is very good indeed.|
038696|340-en|en|mp3/p340_288.mp3|||We could have had no new money.|
038697|340-en|en|mp3/p340_289.mp3|||It wasn't an easy decision.|
038698|340-en|en|mp3/p340_290.mp3|||It wasn't really like that at all.|
038699|340-en|en|mp3/p340_291.mp3|||What will happen to them now?|
038700|340-en|en|mp3/p340_292.mp3|||It is set in Paris.|
038701|340-en|en|mp3/p340_293.mp3|||The Dream is as hard as they come.|
038702|340-en|en|mp3/p340_294.mp3|||We are not collecting.|
038703|340-en|en|mp3/p340_295.mp3|||It shows the right amount of progress.|
038704|340-en|en|mp3/p340_296.mp3|||I thought the dancing was over.|
038705|340-en|en|mp3/p340_297.mp3|||I think they have got it completely right.|
038706|340-en|en|mp3/p340_298.mp3|||This is excellent news for Glasgow.|
038707|340-en|en|mp3/p340_299.mp3|||He's already made history.|
038708|340-en|en|mp3/p340_300.mp3|||Police have appealed for witnesses.|
038709|340-en|en|mp3/p340_301.mp3|||There is a lot of fear.|
038710|340-en|en|mp3/p340_302.mp3|||They are not left wing.|
038711|340-en|en|mp3/p340_303.mp3|||I've heard it all before.|
038712|340-en|en|mp3/p340_304.mp3|||We are not there yet.|
038713|340-en|en|mp3/p340_305.mp3|||We will not give up on the truth.|
038714|340-en|en|mp3/p340_306.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCall.|
038715|340-en|en|mp3/p340_307.mp3|||Now they had it.|
038716|340-en|en|mp3/p340_308.mp3|||She died a few days later.|
038717|340-en|en|mp3/p340_309.mp3|||What is their concern?|
038718|340-en|en|mp3/p340_310.mp3|||The difference was amazing.|
038719|340-en|en|mp3/p340_311.mp3|||That is why we are here.|
038720|340-en|en|mp3/p340_312.mp3|||But it is historic.|
038721|340-en|en|mp3/p340_313.mp3|||You have to feel for the guy.|
038722|340-en|en|mp3/p340_314.mp3|||I have still to hear about that.|
038723|340-en|en|mp3/p340_315.mp3|||I'm going to win the next two.|
038724|340-en|en|mp3/p340_316.mp3|||You know it was good fun.|
038725|340-en|en|mp3/p340_317.mp3|||They want that school.|
038726|340-en|en|mp3/p340_318.mp3|||They have not changed at all.|
038727|340-en|en|mp3/p340_319.mp3|||One is investment, one is reform.|
038728|340-en|en|mp3/p340_320.mp3|||The last few weeks have been really bad.|
038729|340-en|en|mp3/p340_321.mp3|||Structural changes will never be enough.|
038730|340-en|en|mp3/p340_322.mp3|||I am extremely cautious.|
038731|340-en|en|mp3/p340_323.mp3|||That was always the danger.|
038732|340-en|en|mp3/p340_324.mp3|||Will they fall in love?|
038733|340-en|en|mp3/p340_325.mp3|||There was nothing sinister in that.|
038734|340-en|en|mp3/p340_326.mp3|||But don't just take my word for it.|
038735|340-en|en|mp3/p340_327.mp3|||Is that what it's about?|
038736|340-en|en|mp3/p340_328.mp3|||And the audience is a surprise.|
038737|340-en|en|mp3/p340_329.mp3|||They worked on it for three hours.|
038738|340-en|en|mp3/p340_330.mp3|||Let's make him a show.|
038739|340-en|en|mp3/p340_331.mp3|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
038740|340-en|en|mp3/p340_332.mp3|||People are using it in their daily lives.|
038741|340-en|en|mp3/p340_333.mp3|||It seemed so personal.|
038742|340-en|en|mp3/p340_334.mp3|||Would that be for men and women?|
038743|340-en|en|mp3/p340_335.mp3|||The government agreed to pay.|
038744|340-en|en|mp3/p340_336.mp3|||I think we have got the balance right.|
038745|340-en|en|mp3/p340_337.mp3|||It was a very terrible thing.|
038746|340-en|en|mp3/p340_338.mp3|||Let's not take too much for granted.|
038747|340-en|en|mp3/p340_339.mp3|||It has been an extremely long haul.|
038748|340-en|en|mp3/p340_340.mp3|||I'll need to discuss it with my family.|
038749|340-en|en|mp3/p340_341.mp3|||She is deeply distressed.|
038750|340-en|en|mp3/p340_342.mp3|||They should have listened to me.|
038751|340-en|en|mp3/p340_343.mp3|||Well, there can be no complaints about this one.|
038752|340-en|en|mp3/p340_344.mp3|||They said they would.|
038753|340-en|en|mp3/p340_345.mp3|||When will this change?|
038754|340-en|en|mp3/p340_346.mp3|||You know the score.|
038755|340-en|en|mp3/p340_347.mp3|||It was like someone had died.|
038756|340-en|en|mp3/p340_348.mp3|||I am an innocent man.|
038757|340-en|en|mp3/p340_349.mp3|||The improvement today was fantastic.|
038758|340-en|en|mp3/p340_350.mp3|||He has been under great pressure.|
038759|340-en|en|mp3/p340_351.mp3|||I'm looking forward to coming home.|
038760|340-en|en|mp3/p340_352.mp3|||She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.|
038761|340-en|en|mp3/p340_353.mp3|||Our Great Depression is our lives.|
038762|340-en|en|mp3/p340_354.mp3|||He was elected as a councillor last year.|
038763|340-en|en|mp3/p340_355.mp3|||I just did not cope with the pressure.|
038764|340-en|en|mp3/p340_356.mp3|||But he did not appear.|
038765|340-en|en|mp3/p340_357.mp3|||So he was anxious to try something new.|
038766|340-en|en|mp3/p340_358.mp3|||The time was right.|
038767|340-en|en|mp3/p340_359.mp3|||It all happened so quickly.|
038768|340-en|en|mp3/p340_360.mp3|||It is working well.|
038769|340-en|en|mp3/p340_361.mp3|||They really want to do it.|
038770|340-en|en|mp3/p340_362.mp3|||He said nothing of the sort.|
038771|340-en|en|mp3/p340_363.mp3|||Governments will have to respond.|
038772|340-en|en|mp3/p340_364.mp3|||It simply doesn't happen.|
038773|340-en|en|mp3/p340_365.mp3|||We wanted to do something different.|
038774|340-en|en|mp3/p340_366.mp3|||The past is history, not destiny.|
038775|340-en|en|mp3/p340_367.mp3|||I love it here.|
038776|340-en|en|mp3/p340_368.mp3|||Things are on track.|
038777|340-en|en|mp3/p340_369.mp3|||Frankly it was disgusting.|
038778|340-en|en|mp3/p340_370.mp3|||It is a tragedy for the area.|
038779|340-en|en|mp3/p340_371.mp3|||He was not entirely correct.|
038780|340-en|en|mp3/p340_372.mp3|||I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.|
038781|340-en|en|mp3/p340_373.mp3|||War is not the action.|
038782|340-en|en|mp3/p340_374.mp3|||There are not enough of them.|
038783|340-en|en|mp3/p340_375.mp3|||It has been a frustrating one.|
038784|340-en|en|mp3/p340_376.mp3|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
038785|340-en|en|mp3/p340_377.mp3|||But we wouldn't want them any other way.|
038786|340-en|en|mp3/p340_378.mp3|||What's in a name?|
038787|340-en|en|mp3/p340_379.mp3|||It feels like a winner already.|

038839|341-en|en|mp3/p341_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
038840|341-en|en|mp3/p341_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

038842|341-en|en|mp3/p341_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
038843|341-en|en|mp3/p341_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
038844|341-en|en|mp3/p341_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
038845|341-en|en|mp3/p341_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.|

038850|341-en|en|mp3/p341_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|

038852|341-en|en|mp3/p341_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
038853|341-en|en|mp3/p341_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
038854|341-en|en|mp3/p341_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
038855|341-en|en|mp3/p341_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

039372|343-en|en|mp3/p343_133.mp3|||The referee had a shocking game.|
039373|343-en|en|mp3/p343_134.mp3|||I haven't been able to do it since.|
039374|343-en|en|mp3/p343_135.mp3|||It's about doing things.|
039375|343-en|en|mp3/p343_136.mp3|||For a few years we had good fun.|
039376|343-en|en|mp3/p343_137.mp3|||All the pressure will be on him.|
039377|343-en|en|mp3/p343_139.mp3|||This is the logic of punishment assaults.|
039378|343-en|en|mp3/p343_140.mp3|||That was a good effort.|
039379|343-en|en|mp3/p343_141.mp3|||We are very hopeful he will be cleared.|
039380|343-en|en|mp3/p343_142.mp3|||He must not be removed from office.|
039381|343-en|en|mp3/p343_143.mp3|||He had finally had enough.|
039382|343-en|en|mp3/p343_144.mp3|||But not all were so defiant.|
039383|343-en|en|mp3/p343_145.mp3|||We are not going to get carried away.|
039384|343-en|en|mp3/p343_146.mp3|||I told that to the police.|
039385|343-en|en|mp3/p343_147.mp3|||On the other hand, the poster did not help.|
039386|343-en|en|mp3/p343_148.mp3|||In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.|
039387|343-en|en|mp3/p343_149.mp3|||But when we do it it is great.|
039388|343-en|en|mp3/p343_150.mp3|||I'm going to win the gold.|
039389|343-en|en|mp3/p343_151.mp3|||He pleaded for caution.|
039390|343-en|en|mp3/p343_152.mp3|||It always had to be about the gym.|

039398|343-en|en|mp3/p343_161.mp3|||That never came to court as a charge.|

039403|343-en|en|mp3/p343_166.mp3|||His is a success story by any standard.|
039404|343-en|en|mp3/p343_167.mp3|||Are his works inside out?|
039405|343-en|en|mp3/p343_168.mp3|||He can do no wrong.|
039406|343-en|en|mp3/p343_169.mp3|||On reflection, it was really quite exciting.|

039408|343-en|en|mp3/p343_171.mp3|||It has been handled entirely properly.|
039409|343-en|en|mp3/p343_172.mp3|||I shall be voting Yes to support him.|
039410|343-en|en|mp3/p343_173.mp3|||Is something which we just don't do.|
039411|343-en|en|mp3/p343_174.mp3|||That began as an accident.|
039412|343-en|en|mp3/p343_175.mp3|||It is, though the law is not clear cut.|
039413|343-en|en|mp3/p343_176.mp3|||He will want to utilise the midfield.|
039414|343-en|en|mp3/p343_177.mp3|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
039415|343-en|en|mp3/p343_178.mp3|||I am looking forward to this film.|
039416|343-en|en|mp3/p343_179.mp3|||This has been very frustrating for him.|
039417|343-en|en|mp3/p343_180.mp3|||The talking cannot go on too long.|
039418|343-en|en|mp3/p343_181.mp3|||I've got a young family.|
039419|343-en|en|mp3/p343_182.mp3|||I hope that that will be forthcoming.|
039420|343-en|en|mp3/p343_183.mp3|||But experience is a wonderful thing.|

039422|343-en|en|mp3/p343_185.mp3|||Of course, there was still much to be done.|
039423|343-en|en|mp3/p343_186.mp3|||If he does, he has a real chance of gold.|
039424|343-en|en|mp3/p343_187.mp3|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
039425|343-en|en|mp3/p343_188.mp3|||It was good today.|
039426|343-en|en|mp3/p343_189.mp3|||She really suffered for her art.|
039427|343-en|en|mp3/p343_190.mp3|||I wouldn't want to miss that chance.|
039428|343-en|en|mp3/p343_191.mp3|||That tells you something.|
039429|343-en|en|mp3/p343_192.mp3|||It has been a magical moment.|
039430|343-en|en|mp3/p343_193.mp3|||Is that not uncanny?|
039431|343-en|en|mp3/p343_194.mp3|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
039432|343-en|en|mp3/p343_195.mp3|||The hotel was huge.|
039433|343-en|en|mp3/p343_196.mp3|||These days are over.|

039436|343-en|en|mp3/p343_199.mp3|||Or so it is hoped.|
039437|343-en|en|mp3/p343_201.mp3|||He said to give a local injection.|
039438|343-en|en|mp3/p343_202.mp3|||This is an internal matter.|

039442|343-en|en|mp3/p343_206.mp3|||I was influenced by all of these things.|
039443|343-en|en|mp3/p343_207.mp3|||He is helping police with their inquiries.|
039444|343-en|en|mp3/p343_208.mp3|||The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.|

039446|343-en|en|mp3/p343_210.mp3|||I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.|
039447|343-en|en|mp3/p343_211.mp3|||We want to get there.|
039448|343-en|en|mp3/p343_213.mp3|||His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.|
039449|343-en|en|mp3/p343_214.mp3|||He said he would appeal the sentences.|
039450|343-en|en|mp3/p343_215.mp3|||The hearing was fair.|
039451|343-en|en|mp3/p343_216.mp3|||He has the edge.|
039452|343-en|en|mp3/p343_217.mp3|||This was not a summit about the euro.|
039453|343-en|en|mp3/p343_218.mp3|||If he leaves, the band is finished.|
039454|343-en|en|mp3/p343_219.mp3|||He saw it all as a big game.|
039455|343-en|en|mp3/p343_220.mp3|||I didn't actually work up a speech.|
039456|343-en|en|mp3/p343_221.mp3|||Here we have not had one hour.|
039457|343-en|en|mp3/p343_222.mp3|||That was never their agenda.|
039458|343-en|en|mp3/p343_223.mp3|||But he kept on repeating it.|
039459|343-en|en|mp3/p343_224.mp3|||She is currently in foster care.|
039460|343-en|en|mp3/p343_225.mp3|||That's the only thing that matters.|

039462|343-en|en|mp3/p343_227.mp3|||The service will only survive with change.|
039463|343-en|en|mp3/p343_228.mp3|||It is, however, an unlikely outcome.|
039464|343-en|en|mp3/p343_229.mp3|||As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.|
039465|343-en|en|mp3/p343_230.mp3|||You have a very persuasive president.|

039472|343-en|en|mp3/p343_237.mp3|||It's really good fun.|
039473|343-en|en|mp3/p343_238.mp3|||Our positions remains unchanged.|
039474|343-en|en|mp3/p343_239.mp3|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
039475|343-en|en|mp3/p343_240.mp3|||Is a drug dealer?|
039476|343-en|en|mp3/p343_241.mp3|||We did not complete the process.|
039477|343-en|en|mp3/p343_242.mp3|||Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.|
039478|343-en|en|mp3/p343_243.mp3|||Where are you taking her?|
039479|343-en|en|mp3/p343_244.mp3|||The weather forecast isn't good.|

039481|343-en|en|mp3/p343_246.mp3|||He died later in hospital.|
039482|343-en|en|mp3/p343_247.mp3|||It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.|

039484|343-en|en|mp3/p343_249.mp3|||It's still got that at its heart.|
039485|343-en|en|mp3/p343_250.mp3|||Actually, nothing much will change.|
039486|343-en|en|mp3/p343_251.mp3|||We will turn the corner.|
039487|343-en|en|mp3/p343_252.mp3|||Of course, it is a tough assignment.|
039488|343-en|en|mp3/p343_253.mp3|||There were too many mistakes.|
039489|343-en|en|mp3/p343_254.mp3|||He says it often enough.|
039490|343-en|en|mp3/p343_255.mp3|||However, my position remains the same.|
039491|343-en|en|mp3/p343_256.mp3|||It was totally out of the blue.|
039492|343-en|en|mp3/p343_257.mp3|||Horses are not affected.|
039493|343-en|en|mp3/p343_258.mp3|||It went on forever.|
039494|343-en|en|mp3/p343_259.mp3|||I'm not going to change from it.|
039495|343-en|en|mp3/p343_260.mp3|||And they are different.|
039496|343-en|en|mp3/p343_261.mp3|||It would have been very easily done.|
039497|343-en|en|mp3/p343_262.mp3|||He knows the course.|
039498|343-en|en|mp3/p343_263.mp3|||That idea is rubbish.|
039499|343-en|en|mp3/p343_264.mp3|||There is no room for error.|
039500|343-en|en|mp3/p343_265.mp3|||Worry can have that effect on some citizens.|
039501|343-en|en|mp3/p343_266.mp3|||As, indeed, they would be.|
039502|343-en|en|mp3/p343_267.mp3|||If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.|
039503|343-en|en|mp3/p343_268.mp3|||We are all suffering.|
039504|343-en|en|mp3/p343_269.mp3|||People should make their own decisions.|
039505|343-en|en|mp3/p343_270.mp3|||That is a question for the next manager.|
039506|343-en|en|mp3/p343_271.mp3|||I knew people on that committee.|
039507|343-en|en|mp3/p343_273.mp3|||Again, we were lucky.|
039508|343-en|en|mp3/p343_274.mp3|||There was no argument.|
039509|343-en|en|mp3/p343_275.mp3|||He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.|
039510|343-en|en|mp3/p343_276.mp3|||She is a valuable member of Government.|
039511|343-en|en|mp3/p343_277.mp3|||I just need a bit of luck.|
039512|343-en|en|mp3/p343_278.mp3|||But it's not the end of Scottish football.|
039513|343-en|en|mp3/p343_279.mp3|||We are talking about one family.|
039514|343-en|en|mp3/p343_280.mp3|||He is not a pathetic figure.|
039515|343-en|en|mp3/p343_281.mp3|||The error appeared in a warrant.|
039516|343-en|en|mp3/p343_282.mp3|||Everything is so new.|
039517|343-en|en|mp3/p343_283.mp3|||It may take time to get it back.|
039518|343-en|en|mp3/p343_284.mp3|||Would they work together again?|
039519|343-en|en|mp3/p343_285.mp3|||I can feel the sound inside.|
039520|343-en|en|mp3/p343_286.mp3|||The answer is yes.|
039521|343-en|en|mp3/p343_287.mp3|||I believe in debate and dialogue.|
039522|343-en|en|mp3/p343_288.mp3|||The second aspect was the fear of failure.|
039523|343-en|en|mp3/p343_289.mp3|||That is a personal matter.|
039524|343-en|en|mp3/p343_290.mp3|||The princess has had other health problems.|
039525|343-en|en|mp3/p343_291.mp3|||I would rather say nothing at the moment.|
039526|343-en|en|mp3/p343_292.mp3|||The clarity is vital.|
039527|343-en|en|mp3/p343_293.mp3|||I could not sit in the stands.|
039528|343-en|en|mp3/p343_294.mp3|||He had a decision to make.|
039529|343-en|en|mp3/p343_295.mp3|||Strikers like to go to the ground.|
039530|343-en|en|mp3/p343_296.mp3|||It makes no influence on the public.|
039531|343-en|en|mp3/p343_297.mp3|||It's ahead of Labour.|
039532|343-en|en|mp3/p343_298.mp3|||It's the whole package.|
039533|343-en|en|mp3/p343_299.mp3|||I was totally wrong.|
039534|343-en|en|mp3/p343_300.mp3|||This has got to stop.|
039535|343-en|en|mp3/p343_301.mp3|||It was a matter of chance.|
039536|343-en|en|mp3/p343_302.mp3|||There is no point of looking any further.|
039537|343-en|en|mp3/p343_303.mp3|||It is a real concern.|
039538|343-en|en|mp3/p343_304.mp3|||Is it the flight?|
039539|343-en|en|mp3/p343_306.mp3|||Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.|
039540|343-en|en|mp3/p343_307.mp3|||Scotland doesn't even have a target.|
039541|343-en|en|mp3/p343_308.mp3|||They really shouldn't have put it out.|
039542|343-en|en|mp3/p343_309.mp3|||A compromise is essential.|
039543|343-en|en|mp3/p343_310.mp3|||Last night, the company could not be contacted.|
039544|343-en|en|mp3/p343_311.mp3|||They need to be involved.|
039545|343-en|en|mp3/p343_312.mp3|||It was not a cover-up.|
039546|343-en|en|mp3/p343_313.mp3|||The children continue to talk to us.|
039547|343-en|en|mp3/p343_314.mp3|||You know the sort of thing.|
039548|343-en|en|mp3/p343_315.mp3|||I cannot say too much about them.|

039555|343-en|en|mp3/p343_322.mp3|||It is now being examined.|
039556|343-en|en|mp3/p343_323.mp3|||It is so out of character.|
039557|343-en|en|mp3/p343_324.mp3|||Otherwise we would all pay the price.|
039558|343-en|en|mp3/p343_325.mp3|||Our thoughts are with her.|
039559|343-en|en|mp3/p343_326.mp3|||It is time, he said.|
039560|343-en|en|mp3/p343_327.mp3|||Everyone believes in it.|
039561|343-en|en|mp3/p343_328.mp3|||We must learn to finish.|
039562|343-en|en|mp3/p343_331.mp3|||He was a one off.|
039563|343-en|en|mp3/p343_332.mp3|||That should give me a chance.|
039564|343-en|en|mp3/p343_333.mp3|||Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.|
039565|343-en|en|mp3/p343_334.mp3|||It is my last chance.|

039636|345-en|en|mp3/p345_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
039637|345-en|en|mp3/p345_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|

039639|345-en|en|mp3/p345_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
039640|345-en|en|mp3/p345_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
039641|345-en|en|mp3/p345_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
039642|345-en|en|mp3/p345_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
039643|345-en|en|mp3/p345_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

039646|345-en|en|mp3/p345_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
039647|345-en|en|mp3/p345_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
039648|345-en|en|mp3/p345_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
039649|345-en|en|mp3/p345_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
039650|345-en|en|mp3/p345_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
039651|345-en|en|mp3/p345_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
039652|345-en|en|mp3/p345_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

040033|347-en|en|mp3/p347_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040034|347-en|en|mp3/p347_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040035|347-en|en|mp3/p347_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040036|347-en|en|mp3/p347_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040037|347-en|en|mp3/p347_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040038|347-en|en|mp3/p347_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040039|347-en|en|mp3/p347_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040040|347-en|en|mp3/p347_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|

040043|347-en|en|mp3/p347_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040044|347-en|en|mp3/p347_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040045|347-en|en|mp3/p347_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040046|347-en|en|mp3/p347_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040047|347-en|en|mp3/p347_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040048|347-en|en|mp3/p347_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040049|347-en|en|mp3/p347_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040050|347-en|en|mp3/p347_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040051|347-en|en|mp3/p347_025.mp3|||A crucial moment has arrived.|
040052|347-en|en|mp3/p347_026.mp3|||We still have a long, long way to go.|

040736|351-en|en|mp3/p351_288.mp3|||It is giving out the wrong message.|
040737|351-en|en|mp3/p351_289.mp3|||I feel it is very irrational.|
040738|351-en|en|mp3/p351_290.mp3|||We were used to being in control.|
040739|351-en|en|mp3/p351_291.mp3|||He's had a lot of injury problems.|

040742|351-en|en|mp3/p351_294.mp3|||Does it matter?|
040743|351-en|en|mp3/p351_295.mp3|||She thought she was going to die.|
040744|351-en|en|mp3/p351_296.mp3|||Were they under-age?|
040745|351-en|en|mp3/p351_297.mp3|||You are going to go to jail.|
040746|351-en|en|mp3/p351_298.mp3|||It is a very worrying report.|
040747|351-en|en|mp3/p351_299.mp3|||I started it, but then forgot all about it.|
040748|351-en|en|mp3/p351_300.mp3|||My mind was made up.|
040749|351-en|en|mp3/p351_301.mp3|||It was an ongoing exercise.|
040750|351-en|en|mp3/p351_302.mp3|||I would love to see it back there.|
040751|351-en|en|mp3/p351_303.mp3|||He then did just that.|
040752|351-en|en|mp3/p351_304.mp3|||He should have won.|
040753|351-en|en|mp3/p351_305.mp3|||He could hardly have been in greater demand.|
040754|351-en|en|mp3/p351_306.mp3|||Who can predict?|
040755|351-en|en|mp3/p351_307.mp3|||It was all very proper and civilised.|
040756|351-en|en|mp3/p351_308.mp3|||I've played them all in the Champions League.|
040757|351-en|en|mp3/p351_309.mp3|||Then you see it.|
040758|351-en|en|mp3/p351_310.mp3|||And it had been a marvellous occasion.|
040759|351-en|en|mp3/p351_311.mp3|||We don't believe anything anymore.|
040760|351-en|en|mp3/p351_312.mp3|||Either system could have prevented the crash.|
040761|351-en|en|mp3/p351_313.mp3|||Here, the fans have been fantastic.|
040762|351-en|en|mp3/p351_314.mp3|||There is good quality.|
040763|351-en|en|mp3/p351_315.mp3|||For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.|
040764|351-en|en|mp3/p351_316.mp3|||But these things are happening now.|
040765|351-en|en|mp3/p351_317.mp3|||He will be really pleased about this.|
040766|351-en|en|mp3/p351_318.mp3|||He had no access to the database.|
040767|351-en|en|mp3/p351_319.mp3|||They were not up to the required standard.|
040768|351-en|en|mp3/p351_320.mp3|||He also seems to have been around forever.|
040769|351-en|en|mp3/p351_321.mp3|||However, it has had only a limited uptake.|
040770|351-en|en|mp3/p351_322.mp3|||At the moment, it is very difficult to know.|
040771|351-en|en|mp3/p351_323.mp3|||Others are expected to do so soon.|
040772|351-en|en|mp3/p351_324.mp3|||They were impressive against France.|

040775|351-en|en|mp3/p351_327.mp3|||Our approach will be different.|
040776|351-en|en|mp3/p351_328.mp3|||It's my initial background.|
040777|351-en|en|mp3/p351_329.mp3|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
040778|351-en|en|mp3/p351_330.mp3|||They're just a nonsense.|

040780|351-en|en|mp3/p351_332.mp3|||He also called in at another farm.|
040781|351-en|en|mp3/p351_333.mp3|||But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.|
040782|351-en|en|mp3/p351_334.mp3|||He will go a long way.|
040783|351-en|en|mp3/p351_335.mp3|||Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.|
040784|351-en|en|mp3/p351_336.mp3|||I lost a part of me.|
040785|351-en|en|mp3/p351_337.mp3|||It's so much more fun.|
040786|351-en|en|mp3/p351_338.mp3|||That's just the kind of thing we have.|
040787|351-en|en|mp3/p351_339.mp3|||It's getting to me.|
040788|351-en|en|mp3/p351_340.mp3|||So we talked about that for a bit.|
040789|351-en|en|mp3/p351_341.mp3|||But he has strong links to Labour.|
040790|351-en|en|mp3/p351_342.mp3|||I am proud of my team.|

040793|351-en|en|mp3/p351_345.mp3|||It will carry on.|
040794|351-en|en|mp3/p351_346.mp3|||Our season is not over.|

040798|351-en|en|mp3/p351_350.mp3|||It will make a big difference.|
040799|351-en|en|mp3/p351_351.mp3|||There was no basis for their arrest.|
040800|351-en|en|mp3/p351_352.mp3|||This latter suggestion is very important.|
040801|351-en|en|mp3/p351_353.mp3|||The deadline for selecting the electors is today.|
040802|351-en|en|mp3/p351_354.mp3|||The Government has listened.|

040804|351-en|en|mp3/p351_356.mp3|||That is a trend which will be encouraged.|
040805|351-en|en|mp3/p351_357.mp3|||It's too horrible to think.|
040806|351-en|en|mp3/p351_358.mp3|||It can be frightening.|
040807|351-en|en|mp3/p351_359.mp3|||He was, but only just.|
040808|351-en|en|mp3/p351_360.mp3|||It may be his last for a while, too.|
040809|351-en|en|mp3/p351_361.mp3|||Further details are expected later.|
040810|351-en|en|mp3/p351_362.mp3|||What's wrong with that?|
040811|351-en|en|mp3/p351_363.mp3|||You will never forget the clutching horror.|
040812|351-en|en|mp3/p351_364.mp3|||Off with their heads.|

040817|351-en|en|mp3/p351_369.mp3|||This was not the show for me.|
040818|351-en|en|mp3/p351_370.mp3|||It is a very big problem.|
040819|351-en|en|mp3/p351_371.mp3|||Frustration is not the word.|
040820|351-en|en|mp3/p351_372.mp3|||The police have to act to help them.|
040821|351-en|en|mp3/p351_373.mp3|||The cause is just.|
040822|351-en|en|mp3/p351_374.mp3|||It may be down, but New York is not out.|
040823|351-en|en|mp3/p351_375.mp3|||Our message is getting through.|
040824|351-en|en|mp3/p351_376.mp3|||But what lies ahead?|
040825|351-en|en|mp3/p351_377.mp3|||She makes me so happy.|
040826|351-en|en|mp3/p351_378.mp3|||They promised to fight the plans.|

040832|351-en|en|mp3/p351_384.mp3|||This should include procedures for personal imports.|
040833|351-en|en|mp3/p351_385.mp3|||It's a fantastic achievement.|
040834|351-en|en|mp3/p351_386.mp3|||Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.|

040836|351-en|en|mp3/p351_388.mp3|||He, too, was not satisfied.|
040837|351-en|en|mp3/p351_389.mp3|||It's easy to see why.|
040838|351-en|en|mp3/p351_390.mp3|||But it didn't happen.|
040839|351-en|en|mp3/p351_391.mp3|||All were believed to be adults.|
040840|351-en|en|mp3/p351_392.mp3|||This is the last straw.|
040841|351-en|en|mp3/p351_393.mp3|||The research was my life.|
040842|351-en|en|mp3/p351_394.mp3|||I am so, so, so lucky.|

040845|351-en|en|mp3/p351_397.mp3|||They would have been forgiven for doing so.|
040846|351-en|en|mp3/p351_398.mp3|||I only wanted to give her a fright.|
040847|351-en|en|mp3/p351_399.mp3|||Where does it come from?|
040848|351-en|en|mp3/p351_400.mp3|||You find it bizarre?|
040849|351-en|en|mp3/p351_401.mp3|||I am very excited about this season.|
040850|351-en|en|mp3/p351_402.mp3|||It has proved a double whammy.|
040851|351-en|en|mp3/p351_403.mp3|||Britain hasn't seen it in this way.|
040852|351-en|en|mp3/p351_404.mp3|||It should be a great game, though.|
040853|351-en|en|mp3/p351_405.mp3|||But is he?|
040854|351-en|en|mp3/p351_406.mp3|||So it's a daily struggle.|
040855|351-en|en|mp3/p351_407.mp3|||But the Foreign Secretary can cope.|
040856|351-en|en|mp3/p351_408.mp3|||If it's not, they didn't go far enough.|

040866|351-en|en|mp3/p351_418.mp3|||It was visibly on fire.|
040867|351-en|en|mp3/p351_419.mp3|||What's it for, after all?|
040868|351-en|en|mp3/p351_420.mp3|||We will be pleased to talk to them.|
040869|351-en|en|mp3/p351_421.mp3|||A number of people could not speak English.|

040871|351-en|en|mp3/p351_423.mp3|||I'm going to take it further.|
040872|351-en|en|mp3/p351_424.mp3|||I kept going for her.|
040873|360-en|en|mp3/p360_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
040874|360-en|en|mp3/p360_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
040875|360-en|en|mp3/p360_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
040876|360-en|en|mp3/p360_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
040877|360-en|en|mp3/p360_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
040878|360-en|en|mp3/p360_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
040879|360-en|en|mp3/p360_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
040880|360-en|en|mp3/p360_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
040881|360-en|en|mp3/p360_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
040882|360-en|en|mp3/p360_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
040883|360-en|en|mp3/p360_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
040884|360-en|en|mp3/p360_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
040885|360-en|en|mp3/p360_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
040886|360-en|en|mp3/p360_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
040887|360-en|en|mp3/p360_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
040888|360-en|en|mp3/p360_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
040889|360-en|en|mp3/p360_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
040890|360-en|en|mp3/p360_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
040891|360-en|en|mp3/p360_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
040892|360-en|en|mp3/p360_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
040893|360-en|en|mp3/p360_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
040894|360-en|en|mp3/p360_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
040895|360-en|en|mp3/p360_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
040896|360-en|en|mp3/p360_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
040897|360-en|en|mp3/p360_025.mp3|||You can never take a win for granted.|
040898|360-en|en|mp3/p360_026.mp3|||My conscience is not clear.|
040899|360-en|en|mp3/p360_027.mp3|||Is that it?|

040901|360-en|en|mp3/p360_029.mp3|||You are not allowed to do that.|
040902|360-en|en|mp3/p360_030.mp3|||That depends on Rangers.|
040903|360-en|en|mp3/p360_031.mp3|||There are two problems.|

040911|360-en|en|mp3/p360_039.mp3|||I'm so grateful for that.|
040912|360-en|en|mp3/p360_040.mp3|||It's not been a good year.|
040913|360-en|en|mp3/p360_041.mp3|||A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.|

040917|360-en|en|mp3/p360_045.mp3|||This will take up to nine months.|
040918|360-en|en|mp3/p360_046.mp3|||And maybe they have.|
040919|360-en|en|mp3/p360_047.mp3|||Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.|
040920|360-en|en|mp3/p360_048.mp3|||Is he conscious?|
040921|360-en|en|mp3/p360_049.mp3|||But we are confident.|

040924|360-en|en|mp3/p360_052.mp3|||That's a concern to me.|
040925|360-en|en|mp3/p360_053.mp3|||She said she was really sorry.|
040926|360-en|en|mp3/p360_054.mp3|||That will be important.|
040927|360-en|en|mp3/p360_055.mp3|||But here it is also very bad.|
040928|360-en|en|mp3/p360_056.mp3|||That view has not altered.|
040929|360-en|en|mp3/p360_057.mp3|||It was very full anyway.|
040930|360-en|en|mp3/p360_058.mp3|||As for the warning, it was not needed.|
040931|360-en|en|mp3/p360_059.mp3|||The incidents are not believed to be linked.|
040932|360-en|en|mp3/p360_060.mp3|||But there is no easy option.|
040933|360-en|en|mp3/p360_061.mp3|||I can't believe she is dead.|
040934|360-en|en|mp3/p360_062.mp3|||No person was charged.|
040935|360-en|en|mp3/p360_063.mp3|||But it would say that.|
040936|360-en|en|mp3/p360_064.mp3|||Most of the works are small in scale.|
040937|360-en|en|mp3/p360_065.mp3|||He was pronounced dead at the scene.|
040938|360-en|en|mp3/p360_066.mp3|||Only the bomber was killed.|
040939|360-en|en|mp3/p360_067.mp3|||But he just carried on anyway.|
040940|360-en|en|mp3/p360_068.mp3|||Nor was it a game without its lessons.|
040941|360-en|en|mp3/p360_069.mp3|||It was that kind of afternoon.|
040942|360-en|en|mp3/p360_070.mp3|||His presence was very important.|
040943|360-en|en|mp3/p360_071.mp3|||What happens next?|
040944|360-en|en|mp3/p360_072.mp3|||They couldn't believe what had happened.|
040945|360-en|en|mp3/p360_073.mp3|||The bombing begins in five minutes.|
040946|360-en|en|mp3/p360_074.mp3|||That took two weeks.|
040947|360-en|en|mp3/p360_075.mp3|||It's worth it, though.|
040948|360-en|en|mp3/p360_076.mp3|||That perhaps is behind the problem.|
040949|360-en|en|mp3/p360_077.mp3|||I have to hand it to the bank.|
040950|360-en|en|mp3/p360_078.mp3|||The question was simple enough.|
040951|360-en|en|mp3/p360_079.mp3|||The voters rejected us.|
040952|360-en|en|mp3/p360_080.mp3|||There was a definite prejudice.|
040953|360-en|en|mp3/p360_081.mp3|||Nothing is going right at the moment.|
040954|360-en|en|mp3/p360_082.mp3|||We never publicise it.|
040955|360-en|en|mp3/p360_083.mp3|||You will be very welcome.|
040956|360-en|en|mp3/p360_084.mp3|||His musicals were very much of their time.|
040957|360-en|en|mp3/p360_085.mp3|||He became enchanted with the process.|
040958|360-en|en|mp3/p360_086.mp3|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
040959|360-en|en|mp3/p360_087.mp3|||It seems very odd.|
040960|360-en|en|mp3/p360_088.mp3|||They couldn't keep it together.|
040961|360-en|en|mp3/p360_089.mp3|||We discovered that for ourselves.|
040962|360-en|en|mp3/p360_090.mp3|||We will continue to provide support for them.|
040963|360-en|en|mp3/p360_091.mp3|||I've always been very taken by the drink.|
040964|360-en|en|mp3/p360_092.mp3|||It was looking bad.|
040965|360-en|en|mp3/p360_093.mp3|||That's what makes it interesting.|
040966|360-en|en|mp3/p360_094.mp3|||It's nice to be involved.|
040967|360-en|en|mp3/p360_095.mp3|||It's not a game.|
040968|360-en|en|mp3/p360_096.mp3|||Buildings are about people.|
040969|360-en|en|mp3/p360_097.mp3|||There is much work to do.|
040970|360-en|en|mp3/p360_098.mp3|||The release attracted little attention.|
040971|360-en|en|mp3/p360_099.mp3|||It was the dreaded sentence.|
040972|360-en|en|mp3/p360_100.mp3|||I have never considered it.|
040973|360-en|en|mp3/p360_101.mp3|||It is not in the public interest.|
040974|360-en|en|mp3/p360_102.mp3|||They had been forced to walk.|
040975|360-en|en|mp3/p360_103.mp3|||It is harder than you think.|
040976|360-en|en|mp3/p360_104.mp3|||The call was ignored.|
040977|360-en|en|mp3/p360_105.mp3|||I am looking forward to it.|
040978|360-en|en|mp3/p360_106.mp3|||Consumers will also benefit.|
040979|360-en|en|mp3/p360_107.mp3|||That would be even more disastrous.|
040980|360-en|en|mp3/p360_108.mp3|||We opened up and everything was gone.|
040981|360-en|en|mp3/p360_109.mp3|||It is looking very special.|
040982|360-en|en|mp3/p360_110.mp3|||They offered to make an investment into it.|
040983|360-en|en|mp3/p360_111.mp3|||People were hitting the floor.|
040984|360-en|en|mp3/p360_112.mp3|||She was close to suicide at one stage.|
040985|360-en|en|mp3/p360_113.mp3|||They took a risk.|
040986|360-en|en|mp3/p360_114.mp3|||Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.|
040987|360-en|en|mp3/p360_115.mp3|||It has no place in football.|
040988|360-en|en|mp3/p360_116.mp3|||It is frustrating that we cannot do that.|
040989|360-en|en|mp3/p360_117.mp3|||This is a classic.|
040990|360-en|en|mp3/p360_118.mp3|||He played it like a veteran.|
040991|360-en|en|mp3/p360_119.mp3|||I have spoken to head office.|
040992|360-en|en|mp3/p360_120.mp3|||I'm not thinking about anyone else.|
040993|360-en|en|mp3/p360_121.mp3|||They will run a mile.|
040994|360-en|en|mp3/p360_122.mp3|||When she went off it was quite amazing.|
040995|360-en|en|mp3/p360_123.mp3|||Britain has never had it so good.|
040996|360-en|en|mp3/p360_124.mp3|||So many people will be affected by this.|
040997|360-en|en|mp3/p360_125.mp3|||It was all very good stuff.|
040998|360-en|en|mp3/p360_126.mp3|||Or was it?|
040999|360-en|en|mp3/p360_127.mp3|||We are under no illusions about this.|
041000|360-en|en|mp3/p360_128.mp3|||But they are a good team.|
041001|360-en|en|mp3/p360_129.mp3|||We have a long way to go.|
041002|360-en|en|mp3/p360_130.mp3|||I hope it has helped the prisoners.|
041003|360-en|en|mp3/p360_131.mp3|||Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.|
041004|360-en|en|mp3/p360_132.mp3|||I knew that we needed to get out.|
041005|360-en|en|mp3/p360_133.mp3|||I had a train to catch.|
041006|360-en|en|mp3/p360_134.mp3|||And this game is all about belief.|
041007|360-en|en|mp3/p360_135.mp3|||I am ready for that.|
041008|360-en|en|mp3/p360_136.mp3|||It is a fantasy.|
041009|360-en|en|mp3/p360_137.mp3|||The only safe investment is cash.|
041010|360-en|en|mp3/p360_138.mp3|||That's the way they are.|
041011|360-en|en|mp3/p360_139.mp3|||Elections would follow in about two years.|
041012|360-en|en|mp3/p360_140.mp3|||We are trying to be realistic.|
041013|360-en|en|mp3/p360_141.mp3|||That was the theory.|
041014|360-en|en|mp3/p360_142.mp3|||Or so it seemed.|
041015|360-en|en|mp3/p360_143.mp3|||Now we look forward to it.|
041016|360-en|en|mp3/p360_144.mp3|||That was worth it.|
041017|360-en|en|mp3/p360_145.mp3|||What's it going to be then?|
041018|360-en|en|mp3/p360_146.mp3|||Who was being affected?|
041019|360-en|en|mp3/p360_147.mp3|||Our players are exhausted.|
041020|360-en|en|mp3/p360_148.mp3|||It is deeply frustrating.|
041021|360-en|en|mp3/p360_149.mp3|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
041022|360-en|en|mp3/p360_150.mp3|||We've had an enjoyable adventure.|
041023|360-en|en|mp3/p360_151.mp3|||This has been carried out.|
041024|360-en|en|mp3/p360_152.mp3|||Our time is up.|
041025|360-en|en|mp3/p360_153.mp3|||It was a moment of madness.|
041026|360-en|en|mp3/p360_154.mp3|||But other Ministers are not convinced.|
041027|360-en|en|mp3/p360_155.mp3|||First meeting was next week.|
041028|360-en|en|mp3/p360_156.mp3|||No, we were not exactly favourites.|
041029|360-en|en|mp3/p360_157.mp3|||Conditions were very difficult for the players.|
041030|360-en|en|mp3/p360_158.mp3|||This solution is not being considered in Scotland.|
041031|360-en|en|mp3/p360_159.mp3|||I didn't think we deserved to go out.|
041032|360-en|en|mp3/p360_160.mp3|||However, we will have to wait and see.|
041033|360-en|en|mp3/p360_161.mp3|||I told them they shouldn't say that.|
041034|360-en|en|mp3/p360_162.mp3|||I don't know how they do it.|
041035|360-en|en|mp3/p360_163.mp3|||Little is known about them.|
041036|360-en|en|mp3/p360_164.mp3|||It is a new company for Scotland.|
041037|360-en|en|mp3/p360_165.mp3|||We're very unhappy about it.|
041038|360-en|en|mp3/p360_166.mp3|||A good actor doesn't think.|
041039|360-en|en|mp3/p360_167.mp3|||But the action is about to be restarted.|
041040|360-en|en|mp3/p360_168.mp3|||It was extremely difficult.|
041041|360-en|en|mp3/p360_169.mp3|||It is about the script for me.|
041042|360-en|en|mp3/p360_170.mp3|||I have a good feeling about this.|
041043|360-en|en|mp3/p360_171.mp3|||And the results were impressive.|
041044|360-en|en|mp3/p360_172.mp3|||The next game is today.|
041045|360-en|en|mp3/p360_173.mp3|||Hopefully it will be a good day.|
041046|360-en|en|mp3/p360_174.mp3|||I was a silly bastard.|
041047|360-en|en|mp3/p360_175.mp3|||There is an ongoing problem with this company.|
041048|360-en|en|mp3/p360_176.mp3|||The process will start tomorrow.|
041049|360-en|en|mp3/p360_177.mp3|||Was the punishment excessive?|
041050|360-en|en|mp3/p360_178.mp3|||The police have an awful lot to explain.|
041051|360-en|en|mp3/p360_179.mp3|||That's when you hope to take advantage.|
041052|360-en|en|mp3/p360_180.mp3|||I could easy do that.|
041053|360-en|en|mp3/p360_181.mp3|||We are really impressed.|
041054|360-en|en|mp3/p360_182.mp3|||I try to be clear in the narrative.|
041055|360-en|en|mp3/p360_183.mp3|||You have to wait.|
041056|360-en|en|mp3/p360_184.mp3|||I did not see anything to begin with.|
041057|360-en|en|mp3/p360_185.mp3|||It's their moment of choice.|
041058|360-en|en|mp3/p360_186.mp3|||I certainly do not agree with that.|
041059|360-en|en|mp3/p360_187.mp3|||It was a disaster of a race.|
041060|360-en|en|mp3/p360_188.mp3|||Only one person can claim the credit.|
041061|360-en|en|mp3/p360_189.mp3|||Maintain the highest standards.|
041062|360-en|en|mp3/p360_190.mp3|||What could we do?|
041063|360-en|en|mp3/p360_191.mp3|||O Neill has delivered.|
041064|360-en|en|mp3/p360_192.mp3|||But there was no going back.|
041065|360-en|en|mp3/p360_193.mp3|||There are some good people in there.|
041066|360-en|en|mp3/p360_194.mp3|||But it won't make a difference.|
041067|360-en|en|mp3/p360_195.mp3|||I'm not going to blame the band.|
041068|360-en|en|mp3/p360_196.mp3|||I think that he got the message.|
041069|360-en|en|mp3/p360_197.mp3|||Here it was very subdued.|
041070|360-en|en|mp3/p360_198.mp3|||Stardom is a funny thing.|
041071|360-en|en|mp3/p360_199.mp3|||They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.|
041072|360-en|en|mp3/p360_200.mp3|||The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.|
041073|360-en|en|mp3/p360_201.mp3|||I sincerely hope not.|
041074|360-en|en|mp3/p360_202.mp3|||I'm really looking forward to that.|
041075|360-en|en|mp3/p360_203.mp3|||She would say he was still the best.|
041076|360-en|en|mp3/p360_204.mp3|||It is dangerous and it is a lie.|
041077|360-en|en|mp3/p360_205.mp3|||We didn't, and it worked for us.|
041078|360-en|en|mp3/p360_206.mp3|||No-one has used it since then.|
041079|360-en|en|mp3/p360_207.mp3|||The baby was dead.|
041080|360-en|en|mp3/p360_208.mp3|||That remains the unanswered question.|
041081|360-en|en|mp3/p360_209.mp3|||Everyone is too upset to comment.|
041082|360-en|en|mp3/p360_210.mp3|||They tried to give her advice.|
041083|360-en|en|mp3/p360_211.mp3|||We should have no more problems.|
041084|360-en|en|mp3/p360_212.mp3|||Pensions are a long-term investment.|
041085|360-en|en|mp3/p360_213.mp3|||An announcement is expected soon.|
041086|360-en|en|mp3/p360_214.mp3|||It was one of those things.|
041087|360-en|en|mp3/p360_215.mp3|||I can understand that.|
041088|360-en|en|mp3/p360_216.mp3|||But sometimes it was even worse.|
041089|360-en|en|mp3/p360_217.mp3|||We had to work hard for it.|
041090|360-en|en|mp3/p360_218.mp3|||That's a big reduction.|
041091|360-en|en|mp3/p360_219.mp3|||There will be good prospects ahead.|
041092|360-en|en|mp3/p360_220.mp3|||I was pleased about that.|
041093|360-en|en|mp3/p360_221.mp3|||That has not changed.|
041094|360-en|en|mp3/p360_222.mp3|||It's a creative energy.|
041095|360-en|en|mp3/p360_223.mp3|||We are not conducting the review.|
041096|360-en|en|mp3/p360_224.mp3|||It just never comes together.|
041097|360-en|en|mp3/p360_225.mp3|||The club has never won it.|
041098|360-en|en|mp3/p360_226.mp3|||His leader wanted to celebrate.|
041099|360-en|en|mp3/p360_227.mp3|||So it was at Easter Road.|
041100|360-en|en|mp3/p360_228.mp3|||It will be a huge difference.|
041101|360-en|en|mp3/p360_229.mp3|||Labour will almost certainly remain in control.|
041102|360-en|en|mp3/p360_230.mp3|||The characters are always the first attraction.|
041103|360-en|en|mp3/p360_231.mp3|||We've got better players here.|
041104|360-en|en|mp3/p360_232.mp3|||We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.|
041105|360-en|en|mp3/p360_233.mp3|||This is wonderful news.|
041106|360-en|en|mp3/p360_234.mp3|||So what's it all about?|
041107|360-en|en|mp3/p360_235.mp3|||I think he was lost for words.|
041108|360-en|en|mp3/p360_236.mp3|||In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.|
041109|360-en|en|mp3/p360_237.mp3|||I want to celebrate the World Cup.|
041110|360-en|en|mp3/p360_238.mp3|||This is a historic occasion.|
041111|360-en|en|mp3/p360_239.mp3|||No-one expected that their parents would stay.|
041112|360-en|en|mp3/p360_240.mp3|||And what happens?|
041113|360-en|en|mp3/p360_241.mp3|||It is all very upbeat.|
041114|360-en|en|mp3/p360_242.mp3|||I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.|
041115|360-en|en|mp3/p360_243.mp3|||We're looking for unity in the council.|
041116|360-en|en|mp3/p360_244.mp3|||The observer saw no evidence of fighting.|
041117|360-en|en|mp3/p360_245.mp3|||We deserved the draw.|
041118|360-en|en|mp3/p360_246.mp3|||Just one of those things, we suppose.|
041119|360-en|en|mp3/p360_247.mp3|||It's up to the defence team.|
041120|360-en|en|mp3/p360_248.mp3|||No one was injured.|
041121|360-en|en|mp3/p360_249.mp3|||We have had our debate.|
041122|360-en|en|mp3/p360_250.mp3|||It is part of his game.|
041123|360-en|en|mp3/p360_251.mp3|||Did he just want to be on telly?|
041124|360-en|en|mp3/p360_252.mp3|||But it was too late.|

041726|362-en|en|mp3/p362_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
041727|362-en|en|mp3/p362_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
041728|362-en|en|mp3/p362_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
041729|362-en|en|mp3/p362_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
041730|362-en|en|mp3/p362_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
041731|362-en|en|mp3/p362_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
041732|362-en|en|mp3/p362_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|

041739|362-en|en|mp3/p362_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
041740|362-en|en|mp3/p362_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
041741|362-en|en|mp3/p362_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
041742|362-en|en|mp3/p362_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|

041913|362-en|en|mp3/p362_194.mp3|||Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.|
041914|362-en|en|mp3/p362_195.mp3|||I never had any real direction at school.|
041915|362-en|en|mp3/p362_196.mp3|||That's how it works.|
041916|362-en|en|mp3/p362_197.mp3|||It is quite a young team, so the future is there.|
041917|362-en|en|mp3/p362_198.mp3|||Do what you want to do.|
041918|362-en|en|mp3/p362_199.mp3|||We know the quality of life goes up.|
041919|362-en|en|mp3/p362_200.mp3|||Who are the public?|
041920|362-en|en|mp3/p362_201.mp3|||When it is ready, it will be signed.|
041921|362-en|en|mp3/p362_203.mp3|||But we have learned that it doesn't.|
041922|362-en|en|mp3/p362_204.mp3|||I'm looking forward to coming home.|
041923|362-en|en|mp3/p362_205.mp3|||They should not be blamed for it.|
041924|362-en|en|mp3/p362_206.mp3|||He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.|
041925|362-en|en|mp3/p362_207.mp3|||Glasgow is a very welcoming place.|
041926|362-en|en|mp3/p362_208.mp3|||It was crucial strike.|
041927|362-en|en|mp3/p362_209.mp3|||I have no secrets.|
041928|362-en|en|mp3/p362_210.mp3|||What do you want to say?|
041929|362-en|en|mp3/p362_211.mp3|||I was so relieved.|
041930|362-en|en|mp3/p362_212.mp3|||They continue to do so.|
041931|362-en|en|mp3/p362_213.mp3|||I think that's a bit of an invasion.|
041932|362-en|en|mp3/p362_214.mp3|||It is a worry.|
041933|362-en|en|mp3/p362_215.mp3|||We are not a retailer, we provide a service.|
041934|362-en|en|mp3/p362_216.mp3|||That is highly unfair.|
041935|362-en|en|mp3/p362_217.mp3|||They are not the answer to staff shortages.|
041936|362-en|en|mp3/p362_218.mp3|||Gas is too expensive.|
041937|362-en|en|mp3/p362_219.mp3|||This plan is an agenda for action.|
041938|362-en|en|mp3/p362_220.mp3|||It was all relative.|
041939|362-en|en|mp3/p362_221.mp3|||And, within itself, it is visionary.|
041940|362-en|en|mp3/p362_222.mp3|||Are you up for business?|
041941|362-en|en|mp3/p362_223.mp3|||It is true, but it is only part of the issue.|
041942|362-en|en|mp3/p362_224.mp3|||You are not in any kind of trouble.|
041943|362-en|en|mp3/p362_225.mp3|||It also makes for interesting viewing.|
041944|362-en|en|mp3/p362_226.mp3|||Life becomes a song.|
041945|362-en|en|mp3/p362_227.mp3|||No wonder he missed the conversion.|
041946|362-en|en|mp3/p362_228.mp3|||Sadly, they did not.|
041947|362-en|en|mp3/p362_229.mp3|||We have nowhere to go.|
041948|362-en|en|mp3/p362_230.mp3|||He has every right to do that.|
041949|362-en|en|mp3/p362_231.mp3|||Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.|
041950|362-en|en|mp3/p362_232.mp3|||That had never happened.|
041951|362-en|en|mp3/p362_233.mp3|||However, our players will fight for that.|
041952|362-en|en|mp3/p362_234.mp3|||They are not suitable.|
041953|362-en|en|mp3/p362_235.mp3|||He is advised that he has done so.|
041954|362-en|en|mp3/p362_236.mp3|||You mean he didn't get the girl?|
041955|362-en|en|mp3/p362_237.mp3|||He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.|
041956|362-en|en|mp3/p362_238.mp3|||The Prime Minister has been in touch.|
041957|362-en|en|mp3/p362_239.mp3|||But the killing will continue.|
041958|362-en|en|mp3/p362_240.mp3|||They've got to get better.|
041959|362-en|en|mp3/p362_241.mp3|||But we are working together for this result.|
041960|362-en|en|mp3/p362_242.mp3|||Mental health is a massive issue.|
041961|362-en|en|mp3/p362_243.mp3|||It doesn't make them evil.|
041962|362-en|en|mp3/p362_244.mp3|||We don't want to be too intrusive.|
041963|362-en|en|mp3/p362_245.mp3|||The most important thing is the game.|
041964|362-en|en|mp3/p362_246.mp3|||He said nothing of the sort.|
041965|362-en|en|mp3/p362_247.mp3|||This would give Scotland around eight members.|
041966|362-en|en|mp3/p362_248.mp3|||In saying that, you just have to get on with it.|
041967|362-en|en|mp3/p362_249.mp3|||The door is open.|
041968|362-en|en|mp3/p362_250.mp3|||Pulled a huge number of viewers.|
041969|362-en|en|mp3/p362_251.mp3|||Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.|
041970|362-en|en|mp3/p362_252.mp3|||Lara is very, very much a girl.|
041971|362-en|en|mp3/p362_253.mp3|||So what went wrong?|
041972|362-en|en|mp3/p362_254.mp3|||We did not play well.|
041973|362-en|en|mp3/p362_255.mp3|||We are in a very strong position.|
041974|362-en|en|mp3/p362_256.mp3|||This will have no effect on the championship.|
041975|362-en|en|mp3/p362_257.mp3|||That is the key.|
041976|362-en|en|mp3/p362_258.mp3|||So, how did you do?|
041977|362-en|en|mp3/p362_259.mp3|||Well, until recently he didn't think so.|
041978|362-en|en|mp3/p362_260.mp3|||It was, however, the wrong side.|
041979|362-en|en|mp3/p362_261.mp3|||I can't deny that fact.|
041980|362-en|en|mp3/p362_262.mp3|||She is now planning a visit.|
041981|362-en|en|mp3/p362_263.mp3|||We could have done without this.|
041982|362-en|en|mp3/p362_264.mp3|||Boy is the town a mess.|
041983|362-en|en|mp3/p362_265.mp3|||Substantial pockets of resistance remain.|
041984|362-en|en|mp3/p362_266.mp3|||He's a great dealer.|
041985|362-en|en|mp3/p362_267.mp3|||Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.|
041986|362-en|en|mp3/p362_268.mp3|||I want to concentrate on the real issues.|
041987|362-en|en|mp3/p362_269.mp3|||He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.|
041988|362-en|en|mp3/p362_270.mp3|||We are moving on.|
041989|362-en|en|mp3/p362_271.mp3|||This is not a crisis.|
041990|362-en|en|mp3/p362_272.mp3|||There's always a chance.|
041991|362-en|en|mp3/p362_273.mp3|||I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.|
041992|362-en|en|mp3/p362_274.mp3|||For me, it's a tension you can feel.|
041993|362-en|en|mp3/p362_275.mp3|||For some, it might not make too much difference.|
041994|362-en|en|mp3/p362_276.mp3|||That's a very serious matter.|
041995|362-en|en|mp3/p362_277.mp3|||They have a way of proclaiming themselves.|
041996|362-en|en|mp3/p362_278.mp3|||But it was to no avail.|
041997|362-en|en|mp3/p362_279.mp3|||Sad to say, it's still waiting.|
041998|362-en|en|mp3/p362_280.mp3|||It has been a major success.|
041999|362-en|en|mp3/p362_281.mp3|||It takes a bit of working out.|
042000|362-en|en|mp3/p362_282.mp3|||I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.|
042001|362-en|en|mp3/p362_283.mp3|||But it didn't bother me.|
042002|362-en|en|mp3/p362_284.mp3|||I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.|
042003|362-en|en|mp3/p362_285.mp3|||I'm very relaxed about that indeed.|
042004|362-en|en|mp3/p362_286.mp3|||He will not be coming back.|
042005|362-en|en|mp3/p362_287.mp3|||He is also a great finisher.|
042006|362-en|en|mp3/p362_288.mp3|||I don't see any problem.|
042007|362-en|en|mp3/p362_289.mp3|||It's an excellent idea that makes sense.|
042008|362-en|en|mp3/p362_290.mp3|||Yet it seemed to work.|
042009|362-en|en|mp3/p362_291.mp3|||Let us hope it doesn't come to that.|
042010|362-en|en|mp3/p362_292.mp3|||I have never felt so well.|
042011|362-en|en|mp3/p362_293.mp3|||There are other things going on.|
042012|362-en|en|mp3/p362_294.mp3|||All is now forgiven.|
042013|362-en|en|mp3/p362_295.mp3|||So who is right?|
042014|362-en|en|mp3/p362_296.mp3|||And this tournament will travel.|
042015|362-en|en|mp3/p362_297.mp3|||There will be new memories.|
042016|362-en|en|mp3/p362_298.mp3|||Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.|
042017|362-en|en|mp3/p362_299.mp3|||We know the goals will come.|
042018|362-en|en|mp3/p362_300.mp3|||How can they get one?|
042019|362-en|en|mp3/p362_301.mp3|||It was an insult.|
042020|362-en|en|mp3/p362_302.mp3|||But we all have to look at ourselves.|
042021|362-en|en|mp3/p362_303.mp3|||We have nothing to hide.|
042022|362-en|en|mp3/p362_304.mp3|||He added, We are full of anger.|
042023|362-en|en|mp3/p362_305.mp3|||He did it all for us.|
042024|362-en|en|mp3/p362_306.mp3|||I don't think that is good enough.|
042025|362-en|en|mp3/p362_307.mp3|||Of course it is.|
042026|362-en|en|mp3/p362_308.mp3|||We all make mistakes.|
042027|362-en|en|mp3/p362_309.mp3|||It was published yesterday on the internet.|
042028|362-en|en|mp3/p362_310.mp3|||That is my commitment.|
042029|362-en|en|mp3/p362_311.mp3|||This is the only problem with the story.|
042030|362-en|en|mp3/p362_312.mp3|||It is good football in Scotland.|
042031|362-en|en|mp3/p362_313.mp3|||Knowledge is everything at this level.|
042032|362-en|en|mp3/p362_314.mp3|||Is that right?|
042033|362-en|en|mp3/p362_315.mp3|||So other options had to be explored.|
042034|362-en|en|mp3/p362_316.mp3|||They should be so lucky.|
042035|362-en|en|mp3/p362_317.mp3|||He is firm but inclusive and very fair.|
042036|362-en|en|mp3/p362_318.mp3|||It is good news for us.|
042037|362-en|en|mp3/p362_319.mp3|||The timing is obvious.|
042038|362-en|en|mp3/p362_320.mp3|||He's a good player, but he's not the only one.|
042039|362-en|en|mp3/p362_321.mp3|||Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.|
042040|362-en|en|mp3/p362_322.mp3|||I don't think it's very real.|
042041|362-en|en|mp3/p362_323.mp3|||Three other people were treated for minor injuries.|
042042|362-en|en|mp3/p362_324.mp3|||I think she was right.|
042043|362-en|en|mp3/p362_325.mp3|||Is that what people want?|
042044|362-en|en|mp3/p362_326.mp3|||CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.|
042045|362-en|en|mp3/p362_327.mp3|||I'd like to continue that record.|
042046|362-en|en|mp3/p362_328.mp3|||It will be a new experience.|
042047|362-en|en|mp3/p362_329.mp3|||The process itself has taken over.|
042048|362-en|en|mp3/p362_330.mp3|||She asked for the appointment with me.|
042049|362-en|en|mp3/p362_331.mp3|||The time commitment is the biggest thing.|
042050|362-en|en|mp3/p362_332.mp3|||It is quite hard to track.|
042051|362-en|en|mp3/p362_333.mp3|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042052|362-en|en|mp3/p362_334.mp3|||But his attendance is not guaranteed.|
042053|362-en|en|mp3/p362_335.mp3|||Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.|
042054|362-en|en|mp3/p362_336.mp3|||I am sure all schools would accept that.|
042055|362-en|en|mp3/p362_337.mp3|||It was quite an ordeal for them.|
042056|362-en|en|mp3/p362_338.mp3|||There are a number of possible outcomes.|
042057|362-en|en|mp3/p362_339.mp3|||Doesn't matter what you do.|
042058|362-en|en|mp3/p362_340.mp3|||O no it's not!|
042059|362-en|en|mp3/p362_341.mp3|||The result could be all down to turnout.|
042060|362-en|en|mp3/p362_342.mp3|||They are in good spirits.|
042061|362-en|en|mp3/p362_343.mp3|||Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.|
042062|362-en|en|mp3/p362_344.mp3|||He was their leader.|
042063|362-en|en|mp3/p362_345.mp3|||The support of Britain is assumed.|
042064|362-en|en|mp3/p362_346.mp3|||So far he has not done so.|
042065|362-en|en|mp3/p362_347.mp3|||Maybe they will show it next year.|
042066|362-en|en|mp3/p362_348.mp3|||They are a very good team.|
042067|362-en|en|mp3/p362_349.mp3|||So there we are.|
042068|362-en|en|mp3/p362_350.mp3|||And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.|
042069|362-en|en|mp3/p362_351.mp3|||It doesn't make me feel any better.|
042070|362-en|en|mp3/p362_352.mp3|||The conversion didn't go over either.|
042071|362-en|en|mp3/p362_353.mp3|||The incident is dead.|
042072|362-en|en|mp3/p362_354.mp3|||We are delighted with the result.|
042073|362-en|en|mp3/p362_355.mp3|||It will take time.|
042074|362-en|en|mp3/p362_356.mp3|||They will do something big.|
042075|362-en|en|mp3/p362_357.mp3|||The programme was awful.|
042076|362-en|en|mp3/p362_358.mp3|||It is having a big impact.|
042077|362-en|en|mp3/p362_359.mp3|||That is very hard, alone.|
042078|362-en|en|mp3/p362_360.mp3|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042079|362-en|en|mp3/p362_361.mp3|||Doesn't he miss it?|
042080|362-en|en|mp3/p362_362.mp3|||The same goes for Russia.|
042081|362-en|en|mp3/p362_363.mp3|||They went down together.|
042082|362-en|en|mp3/p362_364.mp3|||Cooking is intricate and complex.|
042083|362-en|en|mp3/p362_365.mp3|||One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.|
042084|362-en|en|mp3/p362_366.mp3|||We were getting very worried.|
042085|362-en|en|mp3/p362_367.mp3|||Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.|
042086|362-en|en|mp3/p362_368.mp3|||You can't really compare.|
042087|362-en|en|mp3/p362_369.mp3|||We thought we were looking in good shape.|
042088|362-en|en|mp3/p362_370.mp3|||Plot is not the issue.|
042089|362-en|en|mp3/p362_371.mp3|||We need to increase the membership.|
042090|362-en|en|mp3/p362_372.mp3|||Certainly, there is much on the agenda.|
042091|362-en|en|mp3/p362_373.mp3|||We should not be complacent.|
042092|362-en|en|mp3/p362_374.mp3|||We all want the same things.|
042093|362-en|en|mp3/p362_375.mp3|||Maybe his time has gone.|
042094|362-en|en|mp3/p362_376.mp3|||She died in hospital two hours later.|
042095|362-en|en|mp3/p362_377.mp3|||Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.|
042096|362-en|en|mp3/p362_378.mp3|||SO, that is it for another year.|
042097|362-en|en|mp3/p362_379.mp3|||The results are tragic.|
042098|362-en|en|mp3/p362_380.mp3|||We are not getting him back.|
042099|362-en|en|mp3/p362_381.mp3|||He was on a horse.|
042100|362-en|en|mp3/p362_382.mp3|||Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.|
042101|362-en|en|mp3/p362_383.mp3|||I told her, and she was extremely grateful.|
042102|362-en|en|mp3/p362_384.mp3|||There may be reasons for it.|
042103|362-en|en|mp3/p362_385.mp3|||He had taken everything from me.|
042104|362-en|en|mp3/p362_386.mp3|||It's a good offer by any standards.|
042105|362-en|en|mp3/p362_387.mp3|||Yes, it took time to recover.|
042106|362-en|en|mp3/p362_388.mp3|||The potential is always in the idea.|
042107|362-en|en|mp3/p362_389.mp3|||I am not a frustrated actor.|
042108|362-en|en|mp3/p362_390.mp3|||No progress has been made.|
042109|362-en|en|mp3/p362_391.mp3|||He can win every week.|
042110|362-en|en|mp3/p362_392.mp3|||This makes up for it.|
042111|362-en|en|mp3/p362_393.mp3|||My mind was made up.|
042112|362-en|en|mp3/p362_394.mp3|||The plot is changing as time goes on.|
042113|362-en|en|mp3/p362_395.mp3|||I never got anything out of it.|
042114|362-en|en|mp3/p362_396.mp3|||It is patently true.|
042115|362-en|en|mp3/p362_397.mp3|||Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.|
042116|362-en|en|mp3/p362_398.mp3|||But don't just take my word, for it.|
042117|362-en|en|mp3/p362_399.mp3|||That is why he is so special.|
042118|362-en|en|mp3/p362_400.mp3|||You hope he prevails.|
042119|362-en|en|mp3/p362_401.mp3|||My mother was getting on at me.|
042120|362-en|en|mp3/p362_402.mp3|||This is a very serious matter.|
042121|362-en|en|mp3/p362_403.mp3|||It's going to be great!|
042122|362-en|en|mp3/p362_404.mp3|||That's a good sign.|
042123|362-en|en|mp3/p362_405.mp3|||I'd never heard anything like it before.|
042124|362-en|en|mp3/p362_406.mp3|||He added that he felt undermined.|
042125|362-en|en|mp3/p362_407.mp3|||Hopefully, it will be good enough.|
042126|362-en|en|mp3/p362_408.mp3|||He declined to be more specific.|
042127|362-en|en|mp3/p362_409.mp3|||But it looks good for next year.|
042128|362-en|en|mp3/p362_410.mp3|||Figures are not relevant to the strategy.|
042129|362-en|en|mp3/p362_411.mp3|||We want everyone to have a good time.|
042130|362-en|en|mp3/p362_412.mp3|||We're going to rebuild.|
042131|362-en|en|mp3/p362_413.mp3|||We are trying to do it properly.|
042132|362-en|en|mp3/p362_414.mp3|||We actually had a laugh about that.|
042133|362-en|en|mp3/p362_415.mp3|||It raises the edge.|
042134|362-en|en|mp3/p362_416.mp3|||He is wanted by German police for questioning.|
042135|362-en|en|mp3/p362_417.mp3|||I had no idea.|
042136|362-en|en|mp3/p362_418.mp3|||As indeed it did.|
042137|362-en|en|mp3/p362_419.mp3|||We made a world record together.|
042138|362-en|en|mp3/p362_420.mp3|||They were outside the circle.|
042139|362-en|en|mp3/p362_421.mp3|||I want to help other women.|
042140|362-en|en|mp3/p362_422.mp3|||He got the part.|
042141|362-en|en|mp3/p362_423.mp3|||Or, rather, it isn't.|
042142|362-en|en|mp3/p362_424.mp3|||He refused to name the survivors.|
042143|363-en|en|mp3/p363_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
042144|363-en|en|mp3/p363_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042145|363-en|en|mp3/p363_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042146|363-en|en|mp3/p363_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042147|363-en|en|mp3/p363_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042148|363-en|en|mp3/p363_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042149|363-en|en|mp3/p363_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042150|363-en|en|mp3/p363_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042151|363-en|en|mp3/p363_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042152|363-en|en|mp3/p363_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042153|363-en|en|mp3/p363_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042154|363-en|en|mp3/p363_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042155|363-en|en|mp3/p363_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042156|363-en|en|mp3/p363_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042157|363-en|en|mp3/p363_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042158|363-en|en|mp3/p363_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042159|363-en|en|mp3/p363_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042160|363-en|en|mp3/p363_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042161|363-en|en|mp3/p363_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042162|363-en|en|mp3/p363_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042163|363-en|en|mp3/p363_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042164|363-en|en|mp3/p363_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042165|363-en|en|mp3/p363_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042166|363-en|en|mp3/p363_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042167|363-en|en|mp3/p363_025.mp3|||It's never been to committee.|
042168|363-en|en|mp3/p363_026.mp3|||Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.|
042169|363-en|en|mp3/p363_027.mp3|||It was actually very, very difficult.|
042170|363-en|en|mp3/p363_028.mp3|||The proposals were not new.|
042171|363-en|en|mp3/p363_029.mp3|||He scored one goal and was on fire.|
042172|363-en|en|mp3/p363_030.mp3|||His party never arrived.|
042173|363-en|en|mp3/p363_031.mp3|||Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.|
042174|363-en|en|mp3/p363_032.mp3|||If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.|
042175|363-en|en|mp3/p363_033.mp3|||He gave no other details.|
042176|363-en|en|mp3/p363_034.mp3|||It's not an improvement for him.|
042177|363-en|en|mp3/p363_035.mp3|||I think it is wide open.|
042178|363-en|en|mp3/p363_036.mp3|||It certainly is cause for concern.|
042179|363-en|en|mp3/p363_037.mp3|||It's on with a roller.|
042180|363-en|en|mp3/p363_038.mp3|||The captaincy will help that, too.|
042181|363-en|en|mp3/p363_039.mp3|||That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.|
042182|363-en|en|mp3/p363_040.mp3|||I think we're a long way forward.|
042183|363-en|en|mp3/p363_041.mp3|||The impact was immediate.|
042184|363-en|en|mp3/p363_042.mp3|||There is a new confidence about the club.|
042185|363-en|en|mp3/p363_043.mp3|||His film is not.|
042186|363-en|en|mp3/p363_044.mp3|||It is the strength of the school.|
042187|363-en|en|mp3/p363_045.mp3|||In my experience, he does not do that.|
042188|363-en|en|mp3/p363_046.mp3|||That is good news.|
042189|363-en|en|mp3/p363_047.mp3|||This has come as a shock to everyone.|
042190|363-en|en|mp3/p363_048.mp3|||He will never be forgotten.|
042191|363-en|en|mp3/p363_049.mp3|||I was not overly concerned about this.|
042192|363-en|en|mp3/p363_050.mp3|||He was very grateful for his health.|
042193|363-en|en|mp3/p363_051.mp3|||The nation has his music.|
042194|363-en|en|mp3/p363_052.mp3|||But real life is not like that.|
042195|363-en|en|mp3/p363_053.mp3|||So now we know.|
042196|363-en|en|mp3/p363_054.mp3|||That is why this action has been taken.|
042197|363-en|en|mp3/p363_055.mp3|||Who will pay for this?|
042198|363-en|en|mp3/p363_056.mp3|||The defender should have won the bloody ba.|
042199|363-en|en|mp3/p363_057.mp3|||There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.|
042200|363-en|en|mp3/p363_058.mp3|||We were upset about the referee.|
042201|363-en|en|mp3/p363_059.mp3|||That is our objective.|
042202|363-en|en|mp3/p363_060.mp3|||What's the problem?|
042203|363-en|en|mp3/p363_061.mp3|||He is not alone.|
042204|363-en|en|mp3/p363_062.mp3|||He did that last Sunday.|
042205|363-en|en|mp3/p363_063.mp3|||There wasn't anything in it.|
042206|363-en|en|mp3/p363_064.mp3|||The club is afflicted by injuries.|
042207|363-en|en|mp3/p363_065.mp3|||Sentencing is also being considered in that review.|
042208|363-en|en|mp3/p363_066.mp3|||Lovely day isn't it?|
042209|363-en|en|mp3/p363_067.mp3|||It was far from business as usual.|
042210|363-en|en|mp3/p363_068.mp3|||Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.|
042211|363-en|en|mp3/p363_069.mp3|||The show is not over.|
042212|363-en|en|mp3/p363_070.mp3|||Saddam Hussein is a devil.|
042213|363-en|en|mp3/p363_071.mp3|||This is a judgment issue.|
042214|363-en|en|mp3/p363_072.mp3|||Thirty people have applied for his job!|
042215|363-en|en|mp3/p363_073.mp3|||It was just an accident.|
042216|363-en|en|mp3/p363_074.mp3|||We are not commenting at the moment.|
042217|363-en|en|mp3/p363_075.mp3|||Today we must not repeat that mistake.|
042218|363-en|en|mp3/p363_076.mp3|||Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.|
042219|363-en|en|mp3/p363_077.mp3|||He is slightly confused.|
042220|363-en|en|mp3/p363_078.mp3|||We did not deserve to go through.|
042221|363-en|en|mp3/p363_079.mp3|||The course has helped a lot.|
042222|363-en|en|mp3/p363_080.mp3|||All the time, that number was coming down and down.|
042223|363-en|en|mp3/p363_081.mp3|||There is room for me.|
042224|363-en|en|mp3/p363_082.mp3|||That can only be a good thing.|
042225|363-en|en|mp3/p363_083.mp3|||I have never seen anything like this.|
042226|363-en|en|mp3/p363_084.mp3|||They are difficult awards to decide.|
042227|363-en|en|mp3/p363_085.mp3|||It was that kind of war.|
042228|363-en|en|mp3/p363_086.mp3|||That is my preference.|
042229|363-en|en|mp3/p363_087.mp3|||He later told The Herald, It is true.|
042230|363-en|en|mp3/p363_088.mp3|||It has come a long way since then.|
042231|363-en|en|mp3/p363_089.mp3|||It was decided he should be dismissed.|
042232|363-en|en|mp3/p363_090.mp3|||But someone has got to do it.|
042233|363-en|en|mp3/p363_091.mp3|||We have not given up.|
042234|363-en|en|mp3/p363_092.mp3|||It was the turning point of the afternoon.|
042235|363-en|en|mp3/p363_093.mp3|||I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.|
042236|363-en|en|mp3/p363_094.mp3|||What has happened?|
042237|363-en|en|mp3/p363_095.mp3|||If they are not, the commission will take action.|
042238|363-en|en|mp3/p363_096.mp3|||Where will the money come from?|
042239|363-en|en|mp3/p363_097.mp3|||She is still very poorly.|
042240|363-en|en|mp3/p363_098.mp3|||It was good fun.|
042241|363-en|en|mp3/p363_099.mp3|||This is a great shame.|
042242|363-en|en|mp3/p363_100.mp3|||We talk about effective military action.|
042243|363-en|en|mp3/p363_101.mp3|||I can't get it.|
042244|363-en|en|mp3/p363_102.mp3|||It was entirely justified.|
042245|363-en|en|mp3/p363_103.mp3|||He demanded to speak to the boss.|
042246|363-en|en|mp3/p363_104.mp3|||It's somewhere in between.|
042247|363-en|en|mp3/p363_105.mp3|||The play was to go straight ahead.|
042248|363-en|en|mp3/p363_106.mp3|||He had never run the distance before.|
042249|363-en|en|mp3/p363_107.mp3|||I am the head.|
042250|363-en|en|mp3/p363_108.mp3|||He is obviously very dangerous.|
042251|363-en|en|mp3/p363_109.mp3|||It can be very worrying.|
042252|363-en|en|mp3/p363_110.mp3|||It's harder, believe me.|
042253|363-en|en|mp3/p363_111.mp3|||We are making no comment.|
042254|363-en|en|mp3/p363_112.mp3|||I sit at home a lot.|
042255|363-en|en|mp3/p363_113.mp3|||That was certainly the case for the parties.|
042256|363-en|en|mp3/p363_114.mp3|||I hope the couples are still together.|
042257|363-en|en|mp3/p363_115.mp3|||We have learned a tremendous amount.|
042258|363-en|en|mp3/p363_116.mp3|||But that is not enough.|
042259|363-en|en|mp3/p363_117.mp3|||These people are helpless.|
042260|363-en|en|mp3/p363_118.mp3|||I wish him well.|
042261|363-en|en|mp3/p363_119.mp3|||Only the details have to be sorted out.|
042262|363-en|en|mp3/p363_120.mp3|||It would be really interesting if they did.|
042263|363-en|en|mp3/p363_121.mp3|||That takes a lot of courage.|
042264|363-en|en|mp3/p363_122.mp3|||Sadly, it is not to be.|
042265|363-en|en|mp3/p363_123.mp3|||Motorists will welcome this.|
042266|363-en|en|mp3/p363_124.mp3|||I welcome this Bill.|
042267|363-en|en|mp3/p363_125.mp3|||This is not a problem.|
042268|363-en|en|mp3/p363_126.mp3|||he announced his plans.|
042269|363-en|en|mp3/p363_127.mp3|||He is the man to beat.|
042270|363-en|en|mp3/p363_128.mp3|||We are getting not a penny.|
042271|363-en|en|mp3/p363_129.mp3|||Look at the turn-out.|
042272|363-en|en|mp3/p363_130.mp3|||Which brings us to the question of money.|
042273|363-en|en|mp3/p363_131.mp3|||It is very simple.|
042274|363-en|en|mp3/p363_132.mp3|||There was something special about that.|
042275|363-en|en|mp3/p363_133.mp3|||Many other areas are coming up.|
042276|363-en|en|mp3/p363_134.mp3|||Sadly, it sounds as if it is.|
042277|363-en|en|mp3/p363_135.mp3|||There were no reports of casualties.|
042278|363-en|en|mp3/p363_136.mp3|||But it's a subtle process.|
042279|363-en|en|mp3/p363_137.mp3|||She didn't tell me anything the night before.|
042280|363-en|en|mp3/p363_138.mp3|||I will be having talks with the workforce.|
042281|363-en|en|mp3/p363_139.mp3|||Changes need to be made.|
042282|363-en|en|mp3/p363_140.mp3|||Things are going well.|
042283|363-en|en|mp3/p363_141.mp3|||Hard it will be.|
042284|363-en|en|mp3/p363_142.mp3|||I was deeply worried.|
042285|363-en|en|mp3/p363_143.mp3|||Maybe it will work there.|
042286|363-en|en|mp3/p363_144.mp3|||How does it all work?|
042287|363-en|en|mp3/p363_145.mp3|||We could easily have lost that game.|
042288|363-en|en|mp3/p363_146.mp3|||There's a lot of it going on.|
042289|363-en|en|mp3/p363_147.mp3|||I doubt it would be genuine.|
042290|363-en|en|mp3/p363_148.mp3|||It would be a masterclass.|
042291|363-en|en|mp3/p363_149.mp3|||It would have been a very explosive issue.|
042292|363-en|en|mp3/p363_150.mp3|||I didn't really expect to be called up.|
042293|363-en|en|mp3/p363_151.mp3|||They will not be going back.|
042294|363-en|en|mp3/p363_152.mp3|||The progress has been steady.|
042295|363-en|en|mp3/p363_153.mp3|||It has no chance.|
042296|363-en|en|mp3/p363_154.mp3|||His body was never found.|
042297|363-en|en|mp3/p363_155.mp3|||If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.|
042298|363-en|en|mp3/p363_156.mp3|||We have been extremely busy.|
042299|363-en|en|mp3/p363_157.mp3|||It appears to have been successful.|
042300|363-en|en|mp3/p363_158.mp3|||This is a big game for them.|
042301|363-en|en|mp3/p363_159.mp3|||We still have to wait for that.|
042302|363-en|en|mp3/p363_160.mp3|||He said it was his greatest work.|

042311|363-en|en|mp3/p363_169.mp3|||They would never let him go.|
042312|363-en|en|mp3/p363_170.mp3|||So what's in store?|
042313|363-en|en|mp3/p363_171.mp3|||He didn't know where to look.|

042321|363-en|en|mp3/p363_179.mp3|||Perhaps it was just as well.|
042322|363-en|en|mp3/p363_180.mp3|||Will he be here for the weekend?|

042384|363-en|en|mp3/p363_242.mp3|||It was an excellent performance.|
042385|363-en|en|mp3/p363_243.mp3|||It is also claimed that he was murdered.|
042386|363-en|en|mp3/p363_244.mp3|||Clearly, there was a mix-up.|
042387|363-en|en|mp3/p363_245.mp3|||I have not had much of him.|
042388|363-en|en|mp3/p363_246.mp3|||Sub Not Used, MacKay.|

042402|363-en|en|mp3/p363_260.mp3|||Whatever we do, we know we can do well.|
042403|363-en|en|mp3/p363_261.mp3|||They may not always be so lucky.|
042404|363-en|en|mp3/p363_262.mp3|||Where was the point in all this?|
042405|363-en|en|mp3/p363_263.mp3|||He was travelling to see his daughter.|
042406|363-en|en|mp3/p363_264.mp3|||It's an hour of the same response.|
042407|363-en|en|mp3/p363_265.mp3|||This is the root of their problems.|
042408|363-en|en|mp3/p363_266.mp3|||Two other men have recovered.|
042409|363-en|en|mp3/p363_267.mp3|||It will be a challenging film.|

042411|363-en|en|mp3/p363_269.mp3|||She is under police escort.|
042412|363-en|en|mp3/p363_270.mp3|||However, that is not in itself enough.|
042413|363-en|en|mp3/p363_271.mp3|||That should not be their conclusion.|
042414|363-en|en|mp3/p363_272.mp3|||We're going to fight it.|
042415|363-en|en|mp3/p363_273.mp3|||The plot is minimal.|
042416|363-en|en|mp3/p363_274.mp3|||His funeral is not expected until next week.|
042417|363-en|en|mp3/p363_275.mp3|||Now we have had enough.|
042418|363-en|en|mp3/p363_276.mp3|||Can you believe it?|
042419|363-en|en|mp3/p363_277.mp3|||He is certainly not looking for another job.|
042420|363-en|en|mp3/p363_278.mp3|||I have a problem with these things.|
042421|363-en|en|mp3/p363_280.mp3|||The gap is closing.|
042422|363-en|en|mp3/p363_281.mp3|||Then there was her childhood.|
042423|363-en|en|mp3/p363_282.mp3|||Other people had looked at it.|
042424|363-en|en|mp3/p363_283.mp3|||And the other winners are.|
042425|363-en|en|mp3/p363_284.mp3|||It was quite a sight.|
042426|363-en|en|mp3/p363_285.mp3|||But he was far from alone.|
042427|363-en|en|mp3/p363_286.mp3|||We have got no money to go anywhere.|
042428|363-en|en|mp3/p363_287.mp3|||I believe he could have turned it around.|
042429|363-en|en|mp3/p363_288.mp3|||The Believer isn't just a movie.|
042430|363-en|en|mp3/p363_289.mp3|||You are looking at him.|
042431|363-en|en|mp3/p363_290.mp3|||The best team won.|
042432|363-en|en|mp3/p363_291.mp3|||It being the weekend, there was no-one there.|
042433|363-en|en|mp3/p363_292.mp3|||It was an achievement all right.|
042434|363-en|en|mp3/p363_293.mp3|||They think that it matters but it doesn't.|
042435|363-en|en|mp3/p363_294.mp3|||He was pronounced dead in hospital.|
042436|363-en|en|mp3/p363_295.mp3|||It should be equal.|
042437|363-en|en|mp3/p363_296.mp3|||It will make a big difference.|
042438|363-en|en|mp3/p363_297.mp3|||I want to make a difference.|
042439|363-en|en|mp3/p363_298.mp3|||What was the cause of all this outrage?|
042440|363-en|en|mp3/p363_299.mp3|||He will have it within two weeks.|
042441|363-en|en|mp3/p363_300.mp3|||How do you feel?|
042442|363-en|en|mp3/p363_301.mp3|||It is a terrible state of affairs.|
042443|363-en|en|mp3/p363_302.mp3|||It was not the right time for me.|
042444|363-en|en|mp3/p363_303.mp3|||But they have the sound.|
042445|363-en|en|mp3/p363_304.mp3|||Not all women are dismayed.|
042446|363-en|en|mp3/p363_305.mp3|||There will have to be a full inquiry.|
042447|363-en|en|mp3/p363_306.mp3|||It is not just in Edinburgh.|
042448|363-en|en|mp3/p363_307.mp3|||It's never happened before.|
042449|363-en|en|mp3/p363_308.mp3|||It was a deeper deception.|
042450|363-en|en|mp3/p363_309.mp3|||Norton was delighted with his successes.|
042451|363-en|en|mp3/p363_310.mp3|||The figures are bad, but not that bad.|
042452|363-en|en|mp3/p363_311.mp3|||There is another side to it.|
042453|363-en|en|mp3/p363_312.mp3|||His remit is specific.|
042454|363-en|en|mp3/p363_313.mp3|||It will be very damaging for research.|
042455|363-en|en|mp3/p363_314.mp3|||I'm a bit overwhelmed.|
042456|363-en|en|mp3/p363_315.mp3|||The Old Firm are growing.|
042457|363-en|en|mp3/p363_316.mp3|||They want to win the title.|
042458|363-en|en|mp3/p363_317.mp3|||Her concerns were not without foundation.|
042459|363-en|en|mp3/p363_318.mp3|||This decision is a farce.|
042460|363-en|en|mp3/p363_319.mp3|||That would be the constructive way forward.|
042461|363-en|en|mp3/p363_320.mp3|||My view has now completely changed.|
042462|363-en|en|mp3/p363_321.mp3|||It was blown out of proportion.|
042463|363-en|en|mp3/p363_322.mp3|||You have no chance of planning permission.|
042464|363-en|en|mp3/p363_323.mp3|||That is taking place in Strathclyde.|
042465|363-en|en|mp3/p363_324.mp3|||He was in a mood.|
042466|363-en|en|mp3/p363_325.mp3|||Was this element always there?|
042467|363-en|en|mp3/p363_326.mp3|||This is an awful lot of money.|
042468|363-en|en|mp3/p363_327.mp3|||He was the architect.|
042469|363-en|en|mp3/p363_328.mp3|||The United Nations must act.|
042470|363-en|en|mp3/p363_329.mp3|||They haven't got a hope.|
042471|363-en|en|mp3/p363_330.mp3|||He was a national treasure.|
042472|363-en|en|mp3/p363_331.mp3|||I think they are right to be impatient.|
042473|363-en|en|mp3/p363_332.mp3|||We need to regroup.|
042474|363-en|en|mp3/p363_333.mp3|||I must make that clear.|
042475|363-en|en|mp3/p363_334.mp3|||The board is currently resolving its differences.|
042476|363-en|en|mp3/p363_335.mp3|||I've never regretted coming here.|
042477|363-en|en|mp3/p363_336.mp3|||He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.|
042478|363-en|en|mp3/p363_337.mp3|||I just had to go for it.|
042479|363-en|en|mp3/p363_338.mp3|||It seems to go down well.|
042480|363-en|en|mp3/p363_339.mp3|||I am feeling on top of the world.|
042481|363-en|en|mp3/p363_341.mp3|||I don't know, really.|
042482|363-en|en|mp3/p363_343.mp3|||Therefore there is a threat.|
042483|363-en|en|mp3/p363_344.mp3|||She would love it.|
042484|363-en|en|mp3/p363_345.mp3|||One was taken to hospital.|
042485|363-en|en|mp3/p363_346.mp3|||You did not see it.|
042486|363-en|en|mp3/p363_347.mp3|||Gritty he did not want.|
042487|363-en|en|mp3/p363_348.mp3|||The world is being invited to visit.|
042488|363-en|en|mp3/p363_349.mp3|||Nobody was able to escape.|
042489|363-en|en|mp3/p363_350.mp3|||Surely the answer is yes.|
042490|363-en|en|mp3/p363_351.mp3|||Secondly, there is the question of money.|
042491|363-en|en|mp3/p363_352.mp3|||He was later deported.|
042492|363-en|en|mp3/p363_353.mp3|||I only found out about it this morning.|
042493|363-en|en|mp3/p363_354.mp3|||I am not sure.|
042494|363-en|en|mp3/p363_355.mp3|||One might think that it is a power.|
042495|363-en|en|mp3/p363_356.mp3|||This place is outstanding.|
042496|363-en|en|mp3/p363_357.mp3|||Obviously we want to stop the rot.|
042497|363-en|en|mp3/p363_358.mp3|||But it is a fact.|
042498|363-en|en|mp3/p363_359.mp3|||They never seem to do anything about it.|
042499|363-en|en|mp3/p363_360.mp3|||We're going to sleep.|
042500|363-en|en|mp3/p363_361.mp3|||It raises a serious question mark.|
042501|363-en|en|mp3/p363_362.mp3|||The work with Alison was a great experience.|
042502|363-en|en|mp3/p363_363.mp3|||It was great fun.|

042504|363-en|en|mp3/p363_365.mp3|||It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.|
042505|363-en|en|mp3/p363_366.mp3|||It is not needed, it should go.|
042506|363-en|en|mp3/p363_367.mp3|||She had not suffered any physical injury.|

042508|363-en|en|mp3/p363_369.mp3|||We have been overwhelmed by the response.|
042509|363-en|en|mp3/p363_370.mp3|||And there are others.|
042510|363-en|en|mp3/p363_371.mp3|||However, it was well worth the wait.|
042511|363-en|en|mp3/p363_372.mp3|||I think we did well.|
042512|363-en|en|mp3/p363_373.mp3|||Only two things are certain.|
042513|363-en|en|mp3/p363_374.mp3|||There is nothing to fear.|
042514|363-en|en|mp3/p363_375.mp3|||Just look at his record.|
042515|363-en|en|mp3/p363_376.mp3|||He was a legend.|
042516|363-en|en|mp3/p363_377.mp3|||It is a memorial.|
042517|363-en|en|mp3/p363_378.mp3|||I have no evidence.|
042518|363-en|en|mp3/p363_379.mp3|||But is he?|
042519|363-en|en|mp3/p363_380.mp3|||We were very unhappy with the incident.|
042520|363-en|en|mp3/p363_381.mp3|||The challenge is to win a cup.|
042521|363-en|en|mp3/p363_382.mp3|||It is something that we would support.|
042522|363-en|en|mp3/p363_383.mp3|||It was a double tragedy for the family.|
042523|363-en|en|mp3/p363_384.mp3|||We are in shock.|
042524|363-en|en|mp3/p363_385.mp3|||Does it really matter?|
042525|363-en|en|mp3/p363_386.mp3|||I loved it - and so did my friend.|
042526|363-en|en|mp3/p363_387.mp3|||A decision is expected today.|
042527|363-en|en|mp3/p363_388.mp3|||I am enjoying it.|
042528|363-en|en|mp3/p363_389.mp3|||It wasn't very pretty to watch.|
042529|363-en|en|mp3/p363_390.mp3|||You have to go for it.|
042530|363-en|en|mp3/p363_391.mp3|||Are these immoral?|
042531|363-en|en|mp3/p363_392.mp3|||It has been a massive success.|
042532|363-en|en|mp3/p363_393.mp3|||It is for the same reason.|
042533|363-en|en|mp3/p363_394.mp3|||The whole thing has been a nightmare.|
042534|363-en|en|mp3/p363_395.mp3|||Players are fighting to stay in the team.|
042535|363-en|en|mp3/p363_396.mp3|||He will have something to say.|

042537|363-en|en|mp3/p363_398.mp3|||I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.|
042538|363-en|en|mp3/p363_399.mp3|||There is a lack of logic.|
042539|363-en|en|mp3/p363_401.mp3|||We are about to have our own Parliament.|
042540|363-en|en|mp3/p363_402.mp3|||I am desperate to play for Scotland.|
042541|363-en|en|mp3/p363_403.mp3|||It is a large number.|
042542|363-en|en|mp3/p363_404.mp3|||She doesn't know where to begin.|
042543|363-en|en|mp3/p363_405.mp3|||This is your chance.|
042544|363-en|en|mp3/p363_406.mp3|||I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.|
042545|363-en|en|mp3/p363_407.mp3|||There's nothing she can't do.|

042547|363-en|en|mp3/p363_409.mp3|||I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.|
042548|363-en|en|mp3/p363_410.mp3|||Clearly the impact is going to be negative.|
042549|363-en|en|mp3/p363_411.mp3|||He died in September.|
042550|363-en|en|mp3/p363_412.mp3|||It was not even this century.|
042551|363-en|en|mp3/p363_413.mp3|||That was really tough.|
042552|363-en|en|mp3/p363_414.mp3|||It's not going to last five minutes.|
042553|363-en|en|mp3/p363_415.mp3|||I am happy with my form.|
042554|363-en|en|mp3/p363_416.mp3|||That's the name of the game, though.|
042555|363-en|en|mp3/p363_417.mp3|||With him are the symbols of his faith.|
042556|363-en|en|mp3/p363_418.mp3|||Overall, it has certainly worked out.|
042557|363-en|en|mp3/p363_419.mp3|||This is actually true.|
042558|363-en|en|mp3/p363_420.mp3|||Both were reduced to rubble.|
042559|363-en|en|mp3/p363_421.mp3|||It could have taken another two months.|
042560|363-en|en|mp3/p363_422.mp3|||Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.|
042561|363-en|en|mp3/p363_423.mp3|||He said he had no reports of casualties.|
042562|364-en|en|mp3/p364_001.mp3|||Please call Stella.|
042563|364-en|en|mp3/p364_002.mp3|||Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.|
042564|364-en|en|mp3/p364_003.mp3|||Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.|
042565|364-en|en|mp3/p364_004.mp3|||We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.|
042566|364-en|en|mp3/p364_005.mp3|||She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.|
042567|364-en|en|mp3/p364_006.mp3|||When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.|
042568|364-en|en|mp3/p364_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042569|364-en|en|mp3/p364_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042570|364-en|en|mp3/p364_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042571|364-en|en|mp3/p364_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042572|364-en|en|mp3/p364_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042573|364-en|en|mp3/p364_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042574|364-en|en|mp3/p364_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042575|364-en|en|mp3/p364_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042576|364-en|en|mp3/p364_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|
042577|364-en|en|mp3/p364_016.mp3|||The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.|
042578|364-en|en|mp3/p364_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042579|364-en|en|mp3/p364_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042580|364-en|en|mp3/p364_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.|
042581|364-en|en|mp3/p364_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042582|364-en|en|mp3/p364_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042583|364-en|en|mp3/p364_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042584|364-en|en|mp3/p364_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042585|364-en|en|mp3/p364_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|
042586|364-en|en|mp3/p364_025.mp3|||Is that not pathetic?|
042587|364-en|en|mp3/p364_026.mp3|||Our nation has been changed by this event.|
042588|364-en|en|mp3/p364_027.mp3|||That would be a big step forward.|
042589|364-en|en|mp3/p364_028.mp3|||I love you so very much.|
042590|364-en|en|mp3/p364_029.mp3|||Scotland needs to hear it, too.|
042591|364-en|en|mp3/p364_030.mp3|||Prime minister Blair is not that way.|
042592|364-en|en|mp3/p364_031.mp3|||But at the moment there isn't the budget.|
042593|364-en|en|mp3/p364_032.mp3|||It is not a matter of concern.|
042594|364-en|en|mp3/p364_033.mp3|||We're not either of those things.|
042595|364-en|en|mp3/p364_034.mp3|||The man has already had too many chances.|
042596|364-en|en|mp3/p364_035.mp3|||It shouldn't be a problem.|
042597|364-en|en|mp3/p364_036.mp3|||It was very moving, actually.|
042598|364-en|en|mp3/p364_037.mp3|||It isn't a free-for-all.|
042599|364-en|en|mp3/p364_038.mp3|||PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.|
042600|364-en|en|mp3/p364_039.mp3|||I was not fit enough and it showed.|
042601|364-en|en|mp3/p364_040.mp3|||I thought it was the only way out.|
042602|364-en|en|mp3/p364_041.mp3|||We welcome the ministers decision.|
042603|364-en|en|mp3/p364_042.mp3|||Since then it has become a tradition.|
042604|364-en|en|mp3/p364_043.mp3|||The concept is simple.|
042605|364-en|en|mp3/p364_044.mp3|||That is how the Farmer is feeling today.|
042606|364-en|en|mp3/p364_045.mp3|||And that's the trouble with this business.|
042607|364-en|en|mp3/p364_046.mp3|||So what did he do?|
042608|364-en|en|mp3/p364_047.mp3|||We must not give in to bastards.|
042609|364-en|en|mp3/p364_048.mp3|||The trial will open today.|

042612|364-en|en|mp3/p364_051.mp3|||There will be no disruption in the schools.|
042613|364-en|en|mp3/p364_053.mp3|||I can live with that.|
042614|364-en|en|mp3/p364_054.mp3|||There is no doubt about that.|
042615|364-en|en|mp3/p364_055.mp3|||The president took offence.|
042616|364-en|en|mp3/p364_056.mp3|||Our commitment is to move forward.|
042617|364-en|en|mp3/p364_057.mp3|||Partly, it is his own fault.|
042618|364-en|en|mp3/p364_058.mp3|||That's where it all started.|
042619|364-en|en|mp3/p364_059.mp3|||The family is so happy for him.|
042620|364-en|en|mp3/p364_060.mp3|||Why has it taken so long?|

042622|364-en|en|mp3/p364_062.mp3|||You make the choice.|
042623|364-en|en|mp3/p364_063.mp3|||It is not the fault of one man, of course.|
042624|364-en|en|mp3/p364_064.mp3|||I knew the script.|
042625|364-en|en|mp3/p364_065.mp3|||It's not going to work.|

042627|364-en|en|mp3/p364_067.mp3|||Perhaps it was her demeanour.|
042628|364-en|en|mp3/p364_068.mp3|||I see no need to change.|
042629|364-en|en|mp3/p364_069.mp3|||It lasted longer than we thought.|
042630|364-en|en|mp3/p364_070.mp3|||They've got more time.|
042631|364-en|en|mp3/p364_071.mp3|||They made a huge impression on me.|

042640|364-en|en|mp3/p364_081.mp3|||That would be a big mistake.|
042641|364-en|en|mp3/p364_082.mp3|||No-one has spoken to me.|
042642|364-en|en|mp3/p364_083.mp3|||His arrival could be the making of them.|
042643|364-en|en|mp3/p364_084.mp3|||I was close enough.|
042644|364-en|en|mp3/p364_085.mp3|||He dismissed the action.|
042645|364-en|en|mp3/p364_086.mp3|||I said How much?|
042646|364-en|en|mp3/p364_087.mp3|||I support the stand that they are making.|
042647|364-en|en|mp3/p364_088.mp3|||The couple had one daughter.|
042648|364-en|en|mp3/p364_089.mp3|||But was it really so big?|

042654|364-en|en|mp3/p364_096.mp3|||Allison is not convinced.|
042655|364-en|en|mp3/p364_097.mp3|||He felt there was no case to answer.|
042656|364-en|en|mp3/p364_098.mp3|||This is a one-off.|
042657|364-en|en|mp3/p364_099.mp3|||He liked to talk.|

042869|374-en|en|mp3/p374_007.mp3|||The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.|
042870|374-en|en|mp3/p374_008.mp3|||These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.|
042871|374-en|en|mp3/p374_009.mp3|||There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.|
042872|374-en|en|mp3/p374_010.mp3|||People look, but no one ever finds it.|
042873|374-en|en|mp3/p374_011.mp3|||When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.|
042874|374-en|en|mp3/p374_012.mp3|||Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.|
042875|374-en|en|mp3/p374_013.mp3|||Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.|
042876|374-en|en|mp3/p374_014.mp3|||To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.|
042877|374-en|en|mp3/p374_015.mp3|||The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.|

042879|374-en|en|mp3/p374_017.mp3|||Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.|
042880|374-en|en|mp3/p374_018.mp3|||Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.|
042881|374-en|en|mp3/p374_019.mp3|||Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.|
042882|374-en|en|mp3/p374_020.mp3|||Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.|
042883|374-en|en|mp3/p374_021.mp3|||The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.|
042884|374-en|en|mp3/p374_022.mp3|||The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.|
042885|374-en|en|mp3/p374_023.mp3|||If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.|
042886|374-en|en|mp3/p374_024.mp3|||This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.|

042888|374-en|en|mp3/p374_026.mp3|||This isn't some form of commission.|
042889|374-en|en|mp3/p374_027.mp3|||The game today is certainly different.|
042890|374-en|en|mp3/p374_028.mp3|||We did it in one take.|
042891|374-en|en|mp3/p374_029.mp3|||I'll take the blame for that.|
042892|374-en|en|mp3/p374_030.mp3|||And that was just for starters.|
042893|374-en|en|mp3/p374_031.mp3|||In order to get there, we have got to invest.|
042894|374-en|en|mp3/p374_032.mp3|||Why did it take a concerted campaign?|
042895|374-en|en|mp3/p374_033.mp3|||I will always remember the horrible images.|
042896|374-en|en|mp3/p374_034.mp3|||What you sow, you have to reap.|
042897|374-en|en|mp3/p374_035.mp3|||We are expecting a big crowd.|
042898|374-en|en|mp3/p374_036.mp3|||I was contacted this morning.|
042899|374-en|en|mp3/p374_037.mp3|||He didn't want me to leave the house.|
042900|374-en|en|mp3/p374_038.mp3|||It's not just a challenge for us.|
042901|374-en|en|mp3/p374_039.mp3|||But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.|
042902|374-en|en|mp3/p374_040.mp3|||I've had a ball.|
042903|374-en|en|mp3/p374_041.mp3|||Treatment is not an issue with these people.|
042904|374-en|en|mp3/p374_042.mp3|||YOU thought it was a headache.|
042905|374-en|en|mp3/p374_043.mp3|||I still hope to go.|
042906|374-en|en|mp3/p374_044.mp3|||Does that put pressure on us?|
042907|374-en|en|mp3/p374_045.mp3|||As a player you have to move on.|
042908|374-en|en|mp3/p374_046.mp3|||It is so out of character.|
042909|374-en|en|mp3/p374_047.mp3|||I am inclined to play it down.|
042910|374-en|en|mp3/p374_048.mp3|||However, it's good to turn the page.|
042911|374-en|en|mp3/p374_049.mp3|||His condition was serious but stable.|
042912|374-en|en|mp3/p374_050.mp3|||He had reason to be pleased.|
042913|374-en|en|mp3/p374_051.mp3|||We have a problem.|
042914|374-en|en|mp3/p374_052.mp3|||I find it puzzling and disturbing.|
042915|374-en|en|mp3/p374_053.mp3|||That alibi is now gone.|
042916|374-en|en|mp3/p374_054.mp3|||But the cost to his health was enormous.|
042917|374-en|en|mp3/p374_055.mp3|||I suspect the latter.|
042918|374-en|en|mp3/p374_056.mp3|||However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.|
042919|374-en|en|mp3/p374_057.mp3|||It is simple, really.|
042920|374-en|en|mp3/p374_058.mp3|||The net is closing.|
042921|374-en|en|mp3/p374_059.mp3|||I cannot believe she has been admonished.|
042922|374-en|en|mp3/p374_060.mp3|||That took a long time to happen.|
042923|374-en|en|mp3/p374_061.mp3|||It was on fire.|
042924|374-en|en|mp3/p374_062.mp3|||This year the exercise is being repeated.|
042925|374-en|en|mp3/p374_063.mp3|||Nobody did in those days.|
042926|374-en|en|mp3/p374_064.mp3|||You, the British people, are the boss.|
042927|374-en|en|mp3/p374_065.mp3|||Where is the discipline?|
042928|374-en|en|mp3/p374_066.mp3|||We were very much a happy family.|
042929|374-en|en|mp3/p374_067.mp3|||They won the trophy in the Hoops.|
042930|374-en|en|mp3/p374_068.mp3|||This time it is official.|
042931|374-en|en|mp3/p374_069.mp3|||It's going to be epic.|
042932|374-en|en|mp3/p374_070.mp3|||She could easily have been killed.|
042933|374-en|en|mp3/p374_071.mp3|||Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.|
042934|374-en|en|mp3/p374_072.mp3|||I didn't mean to kill her.|
042935|374-en|en|mp3/p374_073.mp3|||We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.|
042936|374-en|en|mp3/p374_074.mp3|||That money could have been coming to Scotland.|
042937|374-en|en|mp3/p374_075.mp3|||I'd love to do another Olympics.|
042938|374-en|en|mp3/p374_076.mp3|||What method of funding is being used?|
042939|374-en|en|mp3/p374_077.mp3|||It is not a standing army.|
042940|374-en|en|mp3/p374_078.mp3|||This is a great day.|
042941|374-en|en|mp3/p374_079.mp3|||He got his degree.|
042942|374-en|en|mp3/p374_080.mp3|||I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.|
042943|374-en|en|mp3/p374_081.mp3|||and their remit is limited.|
042944|374-en|en|mp3/p374_082.mp3|||I have great respect for all my players.|
042945|374-en|en|mp3/p374_083.mp3|||They might be broken, but they are not defeated.|
042946|374-en|en|mp3/p374_084.mp3|||There is no question of dithering.|
042947|374-en|en|mp3/p374_085.mp3|||His track record is not promising.|
042948|374-en|en|mp3/p374_086.mp3|||Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.|
042949|374-en|en|mp3/p374_087.mp3|||It would be very dangerous.|
042950|374-en|en|mp3/p374_088.mp3|||Now it has been eclipsed.|
042951|374-en|en|mp3/p374_089.mp3|||Our numbers are small.|
042952|374-en|en|mp3/p374_090.mp3|||We have no idea what caused the derailment.|
042953|374-en|en|mp3/p374_091.mp3|||I am confident of the outcome this week.|
042954|374-en|en|mp3/p374_092.mp3|||It's not right of Labour.|
042955|374-en|en|mp3/p374_093.mp3|||It doesn't always work that way.|
042956|374-en|en|mp3/p374_094.mp3|||This was much worse.|
042957|374-en|en|mp3/p374_095.mp3|||That, though, is not true.|
042958|374-en|en|mp3/p374_096.mp3|||I'm working at the moment.|
042959|374-en|en|mp3/p374_097.mp3|||However, this is only the start.|
042960|374-en|en|mp3/p374_098.mp3|||They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.|
042961|374-en|en|mp3/p374_099.mp3|||He loved it, and so did they.|
042962|374-en|en|mp3/p374_100.mp3|||I want to be there by right.|
042963|374-en|en|mp3/p374_101.mp3|||That was very important.|
042964|374-en|en|mp3/p374_102.mp3|||Two and a half million people have died.|
042965|374-en|en|mp3/p374_103.mp3|||I hope they understand that.|
042966|374-en|en|mp3/p374_104.mp3|||Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.|
042967|374-en|en|mp3/p374_105.mp3|||It's a very, very special day.|
042968|374-en|en|mp3/p374_106.mp3|||Let that be their memorial.|
042969|374-en|en|mp3/p374_107.mp3|||We're all paying for it.|
042970|374-en|en|mp3/p374_108.mp3|||Lester was like that.|
042971|374-en|en|mp3/p374_109.mp3|||Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.|
042972|374-en|en|mp3/p374_110.mp3|||That is very, very bad news for our nation.|
042973|374-en|en|mp3/p374_111.mp3|||We were never told it was already decided.|
042974|374-en|en|mp3/p374_112.mp3|||It was a sickening sight.|
042975|374-en|en|mp3/p374_113.mp3|||We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.|
042976|374-en|en|mp3/p374_114.mp3|||I don't think it would make any difference.|
042977|374-en|en|mp3/p374_115.mp3|||They have just got to believe in themselves.|
042978|374-en|en|mp3/p374_116.mp3|||If that is not a warning, what is it?|
042979|374-en|en|mp3/p374_117.mp3|||I fell in love with it.|
042980|374-en|en|mp3/p374_118.mp3|||It ignores the future.|
042981|374-en|en|mp3/p374_119.mp3|||The quality of work is very impressive.|
042982|374-en|en|mp3/p374_120.mp3|||That's not going to happen again.|
042983|374-en|en|mp3/p374_121.mp3|||Paterson was the man.|
042984|374-en|en|mp3/p374_122.mp3|||The course is in great condition.|
042985|374-en|en|mp3/p374_123.mp3|||Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.|
042986|374-en|en|mp3/p374_124.mp3|||It is too early to speculate.|
042987|374-en|en|mp3/p374_125.mp3|||It's up to them.|
042988|374-en|en|mp3/p374_126.mp3|||They went to the press.|
042989|374-en|en|mp3/p374_127.mp3|||I am happy to play for Aberdeen.|
042990|374-en|en|mp3/p374_128.mp3|||We are very pleased.|
042991|374-en|en|mp3/p374_129.mp3|||You're not going to get hurt.|
042992|374-en|en|mp3/p374_130.mp3|||THE arrow was aimed at the heart.|
042993|374-en|en|mp3/p374_131.mp3|||I was very fortunate.|
042994|374-en|en|mp3/p374_132.mp3|||It had been in place since last July.|
042995|374-en|en|mp3/p374_133.mp3|||Players want to know what is on offer.|
042996|374-en|en|mp3/p374_134.mp3|||They are a good team.|
042997|374-en|en|mp3/p374_135.mp3|||The contest was already over.|
042998|374-en|en|mp3/p374_136.mp3|||Does it make a profit?|
042999|374-en|en|mp3/p374_137.mp3|||Now, that would impress the kids.|
043000|374-en|en|mp3/p374_138.mp3|||It was the only possible decision.|
043001|374-en|en|mp3/p374_139.mp3|||How much of a cop out is that?|
043002|374-en|en|mp3/p374_140.mp3|||The whole region is in shock.|
043003|374-en|en|mp3/p374_141.mp3|||Where is the logic in that?|
043004|374-en|en|mp3/p374_142.mp3|||I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.|
043005|374-en|en|mp3/p374_143.mp3|||I told the players that at half-time.|
043006|374-en|en|mp3/p374_144.mp3|||I see the extended family once a year.|
043007|374-en|en|mp3/p374_145.mp3|||Why is this?|
043008|374-en|en|mp3/p374_146.mp3|||It was indeed a night to remember.|
043009|374-en|en|mp3/p374_147.mp3|||Raymond was always on the outside.|
043010|374-en|en|mp3/p374_148.mp3|||There is something in this.|
043011|374-en|en|mp3/p374_149.mp3|||And so it should.|
043012|374-en|en|mp3/p374_150.mp3|||News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.|
043013|374-en|en|mp3/p374_151.mp3|||They may differ on other issues.|
043014|374-en|en|mp3/p374_152.mp3|||That's the important thing.|
043015|374-en|en|mp3/p374_153.mp3|||But opinion was divided.|
043016|374-en|en|mp3/p374_154.mp3|||Next league matches Motherwell.|
043017|374-en|en|mp3/p374_155.mp3|||I have been there already.|
043018|374-en|en|mp3/p374_156.mp3|||My wife is totally behind me on this.|
043019|374-en|en|mp3/p374_157.mp3|||Scott and Emily were so happy.|
043020|374-en|en|mp3/p374_158.mp3|||Sub Not Used, McCulloch.|
043021|374-en|en|mp3/p374_159.mp3|||But every two minutes it was exploding.|
043022|374-en|en|mp3/p374_160.mp3|||And sooner than we may think.|
043023|374-en|en|mp3/p374_161.mp3|||It is a step up.|
043024|374-en|en|mp3/p374_162.mp3|||You probably have never seen them before.|
043025|374-en|en|mp3/p374_163.mp3|||However, it is not all bad news for women.|
043026|374-en|en|mp3/p374_164.mp3|||We're very proud of him and his achievement.|
043027|374-en|en|mp3/p374_165.mp3|||Something has got to change.|
043028|374-en|en|mp3/p374_166.mp3|||I made a mistake.|
043029|374-en|en|mp3/p374_167.mp3|||I'd never given up on myself.|
043030|374-en|en|mp3/p374_168.mp3|||That prevented any recurrence of the problem.|
043031|374-en|en|mp3/p374_169.mp3|||That's the kind of production it was.|
043032|374-en|en|mp3/p374_170.mp3|||Little girls are his victims.|
043033|374-en|en|mp3/p374_171.mp3|||It is not for me, though.|
043034|374-en|en|mp3/p374_172.mp3|||Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.|
043035|374-en|en|mp3/p374_173.mp3|||The rest is his own.|
043036|374-en|en|mp3/p374_174.mp3|||The statement was a lie.|
043037|374-en|en|mp3/p374_175.mp3|||It is the manager's decision.|
043038|374-en|en|mp3/p374_176.mp3|||It was a day for records.|
043039|374-en|en|mp3/p374_177.mp3|||The Government has to grasp the nettle.|
043040|374-en|en|mp3/p374_178.mp3|||There's no reason for panic.|
043041|374-en|en|mp3/p374_179.mp3|||We have got away with it.|
043042|374-en|en|mp3/p374_180.mp3|||However, the referee was not in the giving vein.|
043043|374-en|en|mp3/p374_181.mp3|||I was doing well at the hustings.|
043044|374-en|en|mp3/p374_182.mp3|||He had planned to sell it.|
043045|374-en|en|mp3/p374_183.mp3|||It was just one of those days.|
043046|374-en|en|mp3/p374_184.mp3|||But it did not last.|
043047|374-en|en|mp3/p374_185.mp3|||She has been unable to work since.|
043048|374-en|en|mp3/p374_186.mp3|||No-one has ever seen inside.|
043049|374-en|en|mp3/p374_187.mp3|||I know nothing about that.|
043050|374-en|en|mp3/p374_188.mp3|||We have not given up.|
043051|374-en|en|mp3/p374_189.mp3|||Archer is no newcomer to the stage.|
043052|374-en|en|mp3/p374_190.mp3|||It's a matter of time.|
043053|374-en|en|mp3/p374_191.mp3|||The number never came.|
043054|374-en|en|mp3/p374_192.mp3|||You encourage them - you can do it.|
043055|374-en|en|mp3/p374_193.mp3|||The winner will be announced by early summer.|
043056|374-en|en|mp3/p374_194.mp3|||This is the New Edinburgh.|
043057|374-en|en|mp3/p374_195.mp3|||The stadium was full.|
043058|374-en|en|mp3/p374_196.mp3|||There isn't much of a scene in Austria.|
043059|374-en|en|mp3/p374_197.mp3|||Perhaps it is jealousy.|
043060|374-en|en|mp3/p374_198.mp3|||His name is Michael Owen.|
043061|374-en|en|mp3/p374_199.mp3|||Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.|
043062|374-en|en|mp3/p374_200.mp3|||I didn't want to ignore the punters.|
043063|374-en|en|mp3/p374_201.mp3|||This hasn't happened in a vacuum.|
043064|374-en|en|mp3/p374_202.mp3|||I foolishly had done nothing about it.|
043065|374-en|en|mp3/p374_203.mp3|||Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.|
043066|374-en|en|mp3/p374_204.mp3|||It was so unfair.|
043067|374-en|en|mp3/p374_205.mp3|||Smith has not let him down.|
043068|374-en|en|mp3/p374_206.mp3|||They have to be dealt with.|
043069|374-en|en|mp3/p374_207.mp3|||Glasgow is a friendly city.|
043070|374-en|en|mp3/p374_208.mp3|||No, it's actually in a block of flats.|
043071|374-en|en|mp3/p374_209.mp3|||They were that poor.|
043072|374-en|en|mp3/p374_210.mp3|||It was an odd affair, in many respects.|
043073|374-en|en|mp3/p374_211.mp3|||Stan is a vital part of our future.|
043074|374-en|en|mp3/p374_212.mp3|||We're very close to being a good team.|
043075|374-en|en|mp3/p374_213.mp3|||All these things have an impact.|
043076|374-en|en|mp3/p374_214.mp3|||I thought their commitment was superb.|
043077|374-en|en|mp3/p374_215.mp3|||I'm really proud of my young players.|
043078|374-en|en|mp3/p374_216.mp3|||There was great support all round the route.|
043079|374-en|en|mp3/p374_217.mp3|||I had nothing to lose.|
043080|374-en|en|mp3/p374_218.mp3|||That is just not true.|
043081|374-en|en|mp3/p374_219.mp3|||History is made at the Masters.|
043082|374-en|en|mp3/p374_220.mp3|||This is not a European Army.|
043083|374-en|en|mp3/p374_221.mp3|||Not so, he insisted.|
043084|374-en|en|mp3/p374_222.mp3|||All of the names are familiar to me.|
043085|374-en|en|mp3/p374_223.mp3|||I wonder what they listen to?|
043086|374-en|en|mp3/p374_224.mp3|||Does a lot of drawing.|
043087|374-en|en|mp3/p374_225.mp3|||A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.|
043088|374-en|en|mp3/p374_226.mp3|||There are moments of honesty, too.|
043089|374-en|en|mp3/p374_227.mp3|||He is doing just that.|
043090|374-en|en|mp3/p374_228.mp3|||The night is young.|
043091|374-en|en|mp3/p374_229.mp3|||That is bad enough.|
043092|374-en|en|mp3/p374_230.mp3|||We used to keep our business rates.|
043093|374-en|en|mp3/p374_231.mp3|||I suspect that it will.|
043094|374-en|en|mp3/p374_232.mp3|||We need to think.|
043095|374-en|en|mp3/p374_233.mp3|||We are very happy with the verdict.|
043096|374-en|en|mp3/p374_234.mp3|||They want it to work.|
043097|374-en|en|mp3/p374_235.mp3|||For once it wasn't about money.|
043098|374-en|en|mp3/p374_236.mp3|||It's not the end of the matter, of course.|
043099|374-en|en|mp3/p374_237.mp3|||That doesn't happen in Europe.|
043100|374-en|en|mp3/p374_238.mp3|||Jackson may well be right.|
043101|374-en|en|mp3/p374_239.mp3|||Then it was the turn of the carnival.|
043102|374-en|en|mp3/p374_240.mp3|||He's very, very lucky to be alive.|
043103|374-en|en|mp3/p374_241.mp3|||It's always somebody else's.|
043104|374-en|en|mp3/p374_242.mp3|||It could now be up to the courts.|
043105|374-en|en|mp3/p374_243.mp3|||We can make a difference.|
043106|374-en|en|mp3/p374_244.mp3|||This was not a contest.|
043107|374-en|en|mp3/p374_245.mp3|||It is just so sad.|
043108|374-en|en|mp3/p374_246.mp3|||Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.|
043109|374-en|en|mp3/p374_247.mp3|||This was not an easy meeting for me.|
043110|374-en|en|mp3/p374_248.mp3|||It all depends on the Chancellor.|
043111|374-en|en|mp3/p374_249.mp3|||I get very excited by that.|
043112|374-en|en|mp3/p374_250.mp3|||The members have clearly spoken.|
043113|374-en|en|mp3/p374_251.mp3|||It was not pretty.|
043114|374-en|en|mp3/p374_252.mp3|||It was like a scene from the Holocaust.|
043115|374-en|en|mp3/p374_253.mp3|||Which means it matters.|
043116|374-en|en|mp3/p374_254.mp3|||This is certainly not the case.|
043117|374-en|en|mp3/p374_255.mp3|||There is great potential on this river.|
043118|374-en|en|mp3/p374_256.mp3|||It's very difficult to find a buyer.|
043119|374-en|en|mp3/p374_257.mp3|||Our thoughts are with his family.|
043120|374-en|en|mp3/p374_258.mp3|||It is a technique.|
043121|374-en|en|mp3/p374_259.mp3|||The court has not decided.|
043122|374-en|en|mp3/p374_260.mp3|||I feel sorry for the Reds.|
043123|374-en|en|mp3/p374_261.mp3|||I just want to get rid of it.|
043124|374-en|en|mp3/p374_262.mp3|||I have not come in to take over.|
043125|374-en|en|mp3/p374_263.mp3|||Is this accurate?|
043126|374-en|en|mp3/p374_264.mp3|||But what did it matter?|
043127|374-en|en|mp3/p374_265.mp3|||Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.|
043128|374-en|en|mp3/p374_266.mp3|||I am expecting to win.|
043129|374-en|en|mp3/p374_267.mp3|||It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.|
043130|374-en|en|mp3/p374_268.mp3|||I was an athlete.|
043131|374-en|en|mp3/p374_269.mp3|||We don't need to change the law.|
043132|374-en|en|mp3/p374_270.mp3|||All of us do.|
043133|374-en|en|mp3/p374_271.mp3|||Three months or so later, they are returning.|
043134|374-en|en|mp3/p374_272.mp3|||That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.|
043135|374-en|en|mp3/p374_273.mp3|||We can only do that for so long.|
043136|374-en|en|mp3/p374_274.mp3|||He got very close tonight.|
043137|374-en|en|mp3/p374_275.mp3|||I don't know why you say goodbye.|
043138|374-en|en|mp3/p374_276.mp3|||It is our other home.|
043139|374-en|en|mp3/p374_277.mp3|||Where do you start?|
043140|374-en|en|mp3/p374_278.mp3|||At the end of the day, two men have been shot.|
043141|374-en|en|mp3/p374_279.mp3|||It was the first time they met.|
043142|374-en|en|mp3/p374_280.mp3|||I am also delighted for all the players.|
043143|374-en|en|mp3/p374_281.mp3|||We are delighted with that.|
043144|374-en|en|mp3/p374_282.mp3|||He did very well, but didn't win.|
043145|374-en|en|mp3/p374_283.mp3|||And we're not there yet.|
043146|374-en|en|mp3/p374_284.mp3|||People don't feel safe, including me.|
043147|374-en|en|mp3/p374_285.mp3|||Later we discovered it was a hoax.|
043148|374-en|en|mp3/p374_286.mp3|||They want to shut the Scottish Office.|
043149|374-en|en|mp3/p374_287.mp3|||It is something that we will put right.|
043150|374-en|en|mp3/p374_288.mp3|||I had a good life at Rangers.|
043151|374-en|en|mp3/p374_289.mp3|||Perhaps we should do the same.|
043152|374-en|en|mp3/p374_290.mp3|||He's very good at relating to adults.|
043153|374-en|en|mp3/p374_291.mp3|||It opened last month.|
043154|374-en|en|mp3/p374_292.mp3|||Just a year later he was dead.|
043155|374-en|en|mp3/p374_293.mp3|||You must be ready to play anyone.|
043156|374-en|en|mp3/p374_294.mp3|||This is a club on the rise.|
043157|374-en|en|mp3/p374_295.mp3|||I had a sense of deja vu.|
043158|374-en|en|mp3/p374_296.mp3|||That was the theory, anyway.|
043159|374-en|en|mp3/p374_297.mp3|||I don't know them or anything.|
043160|374-en|en|mp3/p374_298.mp3|||I couldn't make out what was going on.|
043161|374-en|en|mp3/p374_299.mp3|||That's what we're trying to achieve.|
043162|374-en|en|mp3/p374_300.mp3|||Because we do not need it.|
043163|374-en|en|mp3/p374_301.mp3|||The atmosphere is businesslike.|
043164|374-en|en|mp3/p374_302.mp3|||They use them for everything.|
043165|374-en|en|mp3/p374_303.mp3|||I've already got this.|
043166|374-en|en|mp3/p374_304.mp3|||There's a story, too.|
043167|374-en|en|mp3/p374_305.mp3|||There have been different reports from different people.|
043168|374-en|en|mp3/p374_306.mp3|||But it has all been worthwhile.|
043169|374-en|en|mp3/p374_307.mp3|||But that's another story for another day.|
043170|374-en|en|mp3/p374_308.mp3|||It was a foolhardy decision.|
043171|374-en|en|mp3/p374_309.mp3|||This is as bad as it can get.|
043172|374-en|en|mp3/p374_310.mp3|||And also, whatever he does, can he really win?|
043173|374-en|en|mp3/p374_311.mp3|||It was just awful.|
043174|374-en|en|mp3/p374_312.mp3|||There was a hell of a row.|
043175|374-en|en|mp3/p374_313.mp3|||We are satisfied with this outcome.|
043176|374-en|en|mp3/p374_314.mp3|||I am not a threat to coaches.|
043177|374-en|en|mp3/p374_315.mp3|||It's never over until it's over.|
043178|374-en|en|mp3/p374_316.mp3|||He had been a singer.|
043179|374-en|en|mp3/p374_317.mp3|||I was very pleased with them today, though.|
043180|374-en|en|mp3/p374_318.mp3|||If you're going to do it, do it right.|
043181|374-en|en|mp3/p374_319.mp3|||We should keep this recent assault in perspective.|
043182|374-en|en|mp3/p374_320.mp3|||No one was listening.|
043183|374-en|en|mp3/p374_321.mp3|||It's not one for the purists.|
043184|374-en|en|mp3/p374_322.mp3|||It may now be too expensive for anyone.|
043185|374-en|en|mp3/p374_323.mp3|||It really is good to be back.|
043186|374-en|en|mp3/p374_324.mp3|||We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.|
043187|374-en|en|mp3/p374_325.mp3|||It will never happen.|
043188|374-en|en|mp3/p374_326.mp3|||We cannot go on like this.|
043189|374-en|en|mp3/p374_327.mp3|||The biggest thing is structure.|
043190|374-en|en|mp3/p374_328.mp3|||This could be a recipe for conflict.|
043191|374-en|en|mp3/p374_329.mp3|||This is great news for us.|
043192|374-en|en|mp3/p374_330.mp3|||We certainly have to try something.|
043193|374-en|en|mp3/p374_331.mp3|||SO now we know the secret.|
043194|374-en|en|mp3/p374_332.mp3|||Harrowing is easy, after all.|
043195|374-en|en|mp3/p374_333.mp3|||What is that?|
043196|374-en|en|mp3/p374_334.mp3|||We just want them home.|
043197|374-en|en|mp3/p374_335.mp3|||And we have beaten them before.|
043198|374-en|en|mp3/p374_336.mp3|||He has two children.|
043199|374-en|en|mp3/p374_337.mp3|||That is the fact of the matter.|
043200|374-en|en|mp3/p374_338.mp3|||It was a matter of choice.|
043201|374-en|en|mp3/p374_339.mp3|||And that's good news for the magpies.|
043202|374-en|en|mp3/p374_340.mp3|||But we can't have a casino.|
043203|374-en|en|mp3/p374_341.mp3|||I'm looking forward to that.|
043204|374-en|en|mp3/p374_342.mp3|||So what is their secret?|
043205|374-en|en|mp3/p374_343.mp3|||It's a great idea.|
043206|374-en|en|mp3/p374_344.mp3|||It was not being marketed properly.|
043207|374-en|en|mp3/p374_345.mp3|||I have been struggling with my form.|
043208|374-en|en|mp3/p374_346.mp3|||That was about it.|
043209|374-en|en|mp3/p374_347.mp3|||It is coming on very well.|
043210|374-en|en|mp3/p374_348.mp3|||We won't go down without a struggle.|
043211|374-en|en|mp3/p374_349.mp3|||By hard work, is the answer.|
043212|374-en|en|mp3/p374_350.mp3|||We were unlucky not to score.|
043213|374-en|en|mp3/p374_351.mp3|||I did not have a bet on myself.|
043214|374-en|en|mp3/p374_352.mp3|||As if they ever stopped.|
043215|374-en|en|mp3/p374_353.mp3|||And that brings us to the point.|
043216|374-en|en|mp3/p374_354.mp3|||Clark is back on top form.|
043217|374-en|en|mp3/p374_355.mp3|||But happily, the story is true.|
043218|374-en|en|mp3/p374_356.mp3|||It does seem a mystery.|
043219|374-en|en|mp3/p374_357.mp3|||Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.|
043220|374-en|en|mp3/p374_358.mp3|||It's for that reason he should resign.|
043221|374-en|en|mp3/p374_359.mp3|||It's a good start.|
043222|374-en|en|mp3/p374_360.mp3|||One person had a broken back.|
043223|374-en|en|mp3/p374_361.mp3|||I hope that is the lucky break.|
043224|374-en|en|mp3/p374_362.mp3|||It is almost like a family.|
043225|374-en|en|mp3/p374_363.mp3|||But when we do it is great.|
043226|374-en|en|mp3/p374_364.mp3|||I disagree entirely with the decision.|
043227|374-en|en|mp3/p374_365.mp3|||My game is coming back.|
043228|374-en|en|mp3/p374_366.mp3|||It was a game they could have won.|
043229|374-en|en|mp3/p374_367.mp3|||Then came the collision with Sergio.|
043230|374-en|en|mp3/p374_368.mp3|||It is a matter for Westminster.|
043231|374-en|en|mp3/p374_369.mp3|||And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.|
043232|374-en|en|mp3/p374_370.mp3|||I can't believe the buzz.|
043233|374-en|en|mp3/p374_371.mp3|||Sport is good for you.|
043234|374-en|en|mp3/p374_372.mp3|||I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.|
043235|374-en|en|mp3/p374_373.mp3|||This is not a struggle against Islam.|
043236|374-en|en|mp3/p374_374.mp3|||This is the goal.|
043237|374-en|en|mp3/p374_375.mp3|||The mood was euphoric.|
043238|374-en|en|mp3/p374_376.mp3|||I want to get at the truth.|
043239|374-en|en|mp3/p374_377.mp3|||Everyone here is very sad.|
043240|374-en|en|mp3/p374_378.mp3|||It was located on the remote control.|
043241|374-en|en|mp3/p374_379.mp3|||I am not changing my mind.|
043242|374-en|en|mp3/p374_380.mp3|||Is something which we just don't do.|
043243|374-en|en|mp3/p374_381.mp3|||He was taken ill in his office.|
043244|374-en|en|mp3/p374_382.mp3|||It is, though the law is not clear cut.|
043245|374-en|en|mp3/p374_383.mp3|||It's the only thing.|
043246|374-en|en|mp3/p374_384.mp3|||Two others were also seriously injured.|
043247|374-en|en|mp3/p374_385.mp3|||What's the best thing to do?|
043248|374-en|en|mp3/p374_386.mp3|||For tragedy it is.|
043249|374-en|en|mp3/p374_387.mp3|||I'm trying to stay open on that.|
043250|374-en|en|mp3/p374_388.mp3|||Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.|
043251|374-en|en|mp3/p374_389.mp3|||It was good today.|
043252|374-en|en|mp3/p374_390.mp3|||We are all very pleased.|
043253|374-en|en|mp3/p374_391.mp3|||The hotel was huge.|
043254|374-en|en|mp3/p374_392.mp3|||These days are over.|
043255|374-en|en|mp3/p374_393.mp3|||They do it properly.|
043256|374-en|en|mp3/p374_394.mp3|||Well, you can have a tree.|
043257|374-en|en|mp3/p374_395.mp3|||I just don't know what she was doing.|
043258|374-en|en|mp3/p374_396.mp3|||However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.|
043259|374-en|en|mp3/p374_397.mp3|||You can't have both.|
043260|374-en|en|mp3/p374_398.mp3|||That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.|
043261|374-en|en|mp3/p374_399.mp3|||I was influenced by all of these things.|
043262|374-en|en|mp3/p374_400.mp3|||You do not change overnight.|
043263|374-en|en|mp3/p374_401.mp3|||Or so it seemed.|
043264|374-en|en|mp3/p374_402.mp3|||I will have to think about it.|
043265|374-en|en|mp3/p374_403.mp3|||He suffered a broken back and other injuries.|
043266|374-en|en|mp3/p374_404.mp3|||Well, you can't have everything.|
043267|374-en|en|mp3/p374_405.mp3|||They have not given them the evidence.|
043268|374-en|en|mp3/p374_406.mp3|||We need to chat.|
043269|374-en|en|mp3/p374_407.mp3|||We are obviously disturbed by this case.|
043270|374-en|en|mp3/p374_408.mp3|||That was never their agenda.|
043271|374-en|en|mp3/p374_409.mp3|||I certainly will not settle.|
043272|374-en|en|mp3/p374_410.mp3|||He said it was the worst possible result.|
043273|374-en|en|mp3/p374_411.mp3|||It's very tragic and traumatic.|
043274|374-en|en|mp3/p374_412.mp3|||It's always the same, isn't it?|
043275|374-en|en|mp3/p374_413.mp3|||I don't make it mystical.|
043276|374-en|en|mp3/p374_414.mp3|||So what was he really doing?|
043277|374-en|en|mp3/p374_415.mp3|||Neither could be contacted last night.|
043278|374-en|en|mp3/p374_416.mp3|||That clearly wasn't what they wanted.|
043279|374-en|en|mp3/p374_417.mp3|||Some old favourites remain in varying forms.|
043280|374-en|en|mp3/p374_418.mp3|||And well he might.|
043281|374-en|en|mp3/p374_419.mp3|||They have not been named.|
043282|374-en|en|mp3/p374_420.mp3|||It feels like too much.|
043283|374-en|en|mp3/p374_421.mp3|||This is the last thing we ever expected.|
043284|374-en|en|mp3/p374_422.mp3|||Next year this time  we will be home.|
043285|374-en|en|mp3/p374_423.mp3|||That time has passed.|
043286|374-en|en|mp3/p374_424.mp3|||It will be crucial.|

043294|376-en|en|mp3/p376_008.mp3|||"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "|

043298|376-en|en|mp3/p376_012.mp3|||"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "|
043299|376-en|en|mp3/p376_013.mp3|||"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "|
043300|376-en|en|mp3/p376_014.mp3|||"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "|
043301|376-en|en|mp3/p376_015.mp3|||"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "|
043302|376-en|en|mp3/p376_016.mp3|||"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "|
043303|376-en|en|mp3/p376_017.mp3|||"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "|
043304|376-en|en|mp3/p376_018.mp3|||"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "|
043305|376-en|en|mp3/p376_019.mp3|||"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "|
043306|376-en|en|mp3/p376_020.mp3|||"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "|
043307|376-en|en|mp3/p376_021.mp3|||"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "|
043308|376-en|en|mp3/p376_022.mp3|||"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "|
043309|376-en|en|mp3/p376_023.mp3|||"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "|
043310|376-en|en|mp3/p376_024.mp3|||"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."|
